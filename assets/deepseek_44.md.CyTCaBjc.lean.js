Answer the following question: This article: Gambler Nathan Detroit seeks to organize an unlicensed crap game, but the police, led by Lieutenant Brannigan, are \\"putting on the heat\\". All the places where Nathan usually holds his games refuse him entry due to Brannigan's intimidating pressure. The Biltmore garage is the only venue where Nathan can hold the game, but its owner requires a 1,000 security deposit, which Nathan doesn't have. Adding to his problems, Nathan's fiancée, Miss Adelaide, a nightclub singer, wants to bring an end to their 14-year engagement and actually tie the knot. She also wants him to go straight, but organizing illegal gambling is the only thing he's good at. Then Nathan spots an old acquaintance, Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything and for high amounts. To win the 1,000 security deposit, Nathan bets Sky that he can't take a girl of Nathan's choosing to dinner in Havana, Cuba. The bet seems impossible for Sky to win when Nathan nominates Sergeant Sarah Brown, a sister at the Save a Soul Mission, which opposes gambling. To approach Sarah, Sky pretends that he is a gambler who wants to change. Sky suggests a bargain. He will get a dozen sinners into the Mission for her Thursday night meeting in return for her having dinner with him in Havana. With General Matilda Cartwright threatening to close the Broadway branch for lack of participation, Sarah has little choice left, and agrees to the date. contains an answer for the question: What's the first name of the person the nightclub singer's fiance set as the target of a bet?, what is it ?

Williams CNN Editor's note: Umbria Communications collects and analyzes postings from millions of weblogs to find out what is being discussed in the blogosphere and who is engaging in discussion. Gas prices rose more than 50 cents over the 12 week period. (CNN) -- Surging gas prices have sparked debates at the water cooler, on Wall Street and in the halls of Congress, and Internet researchers say it's also a hot topic in the blogosphere. The marketing research firm Umbria Communications, in partnership with CNN.com, studied blog postings published between the weeks of March 12 and May 28, and found that the number of mentions of gas prices increased by more than 45 percent -- from 4,032 mentions/million posts to 5,865 mentions/million. To put those numbers in perspective, the XBox -- Microsoft's popular gaming system -- got 11,053 mentions/million in a recent week, while eBay got 7,310 mentions/million and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had 1,439 mentions/million. (See charts from Umbria) The increase in mentions tended to follow the change in gas prices, which rose about 50 cents during that period, but there were some spikes in the discussion. The number jumped to 8,421 mentions/million during the week ending May 7, the week after Senate Republicans proposed an energy plan that included giving most taxpayers a 100 gas rebate and Congressional leaders called for a price gouging investigation. President Bush also said he wanted to increase automobile fuel efficiency standards and Exxon Mobil reported 8.4 billion in profits for the first quarter of the year. Blogging on gas prices peaked at 8,764 mentions/million during the week ending May 21, as bloggers reacted to General Motors' plan to offer subsidized gas in California and Florida to buyers of big SUVs like the Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon and the Hummer H2 and H3. People were also discussing the impact of gas prices on their Memorial Day travel plans. Umbria President Howard Kaushansky said his company collects millions of published blog post in a data warehouse, so that the company's analysts can look for trends. He compared it to a public opinion survey -- only without the survey. \\"By merely listening in on tens of millions of bloggers out there, there are now close to 40 million bloggers, we can identify what's on people's minds, what they talk about in an unprompted manner,\\" Kaushansky said. Umbria uses speech patterns to determine the age and gender of blog posters and divides the blogger population into three age groups: Kaushansky said male boomers tend to dominate political discussion, but that wasn't the case with gas prices. Members of Generation Y made up almost 55 percent of the blogging population during the week ending May 28, but they made up more than 69 percent of the posts on the subject. Boomer males, on the other hand, made up 13 percent of that population, but made just 10 percent of the posts. \\"I would have thought that gas prices was sort of an across the board issue for people, but it seems like it's a more younger issue and more young people are talking about it and talking about it more negatively,\\" Kaushansky said. Umbria director of product management Michael Sevilla said gas prices were cutting into the discretionary spending for members of Generation Y -- many of whom were just getting started in their careers, going to college, or still living with their parents. \\"Although they did not directly say it, they alluded to the fact that now a larger percentage of their meager dollars had to go to gas,\\" Sevilla said. \\"And that means less driving around to visit friends and fewer dollars to buy things.\\" Kaushansky said he was surprised that the study found a substantial number of positive comments about gas prices. For example, during the week ending March 12, there were 1,056 negative mentions of gas prices/million and 945 positive mentions. The remaining 2,031 mentions were either neutral, or too vague to determine the sentiment. But Kaushansky said that doesn't mean people were happy to pay more. Some posts argued it was good for the free market to run its course, even if it meant paying more for gas, he said. Others said that if it was OK for Derek Jeter to make millions playing baseball and Julia Roberts to get big paychecks for being in movies, then there was nothing wrong with Exxon Mobil's 8 billion profit. He said other positive posts came from people who were happy that they bought a hybrid or met a new friend on the bus.

Question: suppose Every breath I exhale carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect no baby will be born. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation is \\"every breath I exhale carbon dioxide\\". According to our current understanding of human biology and the carbon cycle, exhaling carbon dioxide is part of the natural respiratory process in humans, where we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. This doesn't have any known significant direct impact on the process of conception, fetal development, or a baby being born. The second effect mentioned is \\"They are born and are a baby\\". This step refers to childbirth and the early stage of a human's life. Analyzing both, the act of exhaling carbon dioxide and the process of a baby's birth, we can understand that they are quite disconnected events. The exhalation of carbon dioxide would not likely have any impact on birth rates as they are not biologically or environmentally related in a direct impactful manner. Therefore, the supposed perturbation (exhaling carbon dioxide) has no effect on the second effect mentioned (babies being born)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs ?If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker--BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device , the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \\"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \\"The Russian Balance Sheet\\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \\"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three. At very least, despite Russia's economic underperformance, its stock market outperformance does suggest it is indeed one of the group.

The picturesque landscape, with its flat, expansive fields and numerous waterways, provided an idyllic setting for a peaceful retirement. The Levels are known for their rich flora and fauna, attracting birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts from all over the country. It also provided numerous outdoor activities, such as boating, fishing, and walking, allowing us to stay active and get closer to nature. Unfortunately, however, the same factors that make the Somerset Levels so beautiful and diverse also render it prone to flooding. As we would soon discover, living here came with a considerable risk – especially during the storm season. Like many others in the community, we were well-aware of this fact, but it did not deter us from embracing the area when we first moved here. Our fellow residents are incredibly resilient and supportive, and together we have taken measures to prepare for and mitigate flood-related risks. This often included participating in community workshops, erecting temporary flood defences, and keeping an eye out for weather warnings. We believed that the efforts made by local authorities and the community would be enough to protect our homes. However, the breaching of the river defences this time was a devastating blow. It caused unforeseen levels of flooding, which led to an urgent evacuation of the affected areas. Despite the timely warnings from the police, many residents, including us, were hesitant to abandon their homes – homes filled with precious memories and belongings we worked hard for. Witnessing our beloved community submerged in water and mud, with no means to save them, was truly heartbreaking. To make matters worse, the floodwater was contaminated with sewage, which posed a significant health hazard. The damage caused by the flooding seems insurmountable, and it will take a considerable amount of time and resources to rebuild and restore our beloved community. In the meantime, we have banded together with our neighbors, making sure everyone is accounted for and assisting with salvaging what little possessions we can. The local authorities have been actively providing support, through emergency relief services and organizing volunteers. The events that have unfolded are a painful reminder of the vulnerability of our environment and the need for adequate flood management strategies. Our community's resilience will be critically tested as we face the long road to recovery. However, despite the struggles ahead, we take solace in knowing that our love for the Somerset Levels and the strength of our support network will help guide us through these turbulent times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) Forecasters originally said the storm could bring 1 to 3 feet of snow and punishing hurricane-force winds. But early Tuesday, they downgraded most of those numbers, saying New England would fare the worst, but even then not as bad as expected. Bruce Sullivan of the National Weather Service said Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, could get the most snow, about 2 feet. New York could see 10 inches to 20 inches, Hartford, Connecticut, 1 to 2 feet, and Philadelphia and central New Jersey about 6 inches. The National Weather Service over the weekend had issued a blizzard warning for a 250-mile swath of the region, meaning heavy, blowing snow and potential whiteout conditions. On Monday, life abruptly stopped across the region as officials ordered workers to go home early, banned travel, closed bridges and tunnels, and assembled their biggest plowing crews. \\"When you wake up in the morning, it is going to look like a blizzard,\\" said Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, echoing the concern of many government leaders. Light snow fell steadily early Tuesday in midtown Manhattan as a few municipal trucks rumbled down empty streets.

More than 7,700 flights in and out of the Northeast were canceled, and many of them may not take off again until Wednesday. Schools and businesses let out early. Government offices closed. Shoppers stocking up on food jammed supermarkets and elbowed one another for what was left. Broadway stages went dark. Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to go home and stay there, adding: \\"People have to make smart decisions from this point on.\\" Commuters like Sameer Navi, 27, of Long Island, were following the advice. Navi, who works for Citigroup in Manhattan, said he takes the Long Island Rail Road every day and left work early Monday after warnings by local officials to get home before the brunt of the storm. \\"I did leave earlier than usual,\\" he said. In New Jersey, plows and salt spreaders remained at work on the roads Monday night in Ocean County, one of the coastal areas that was expected to be among the hardest hit. There was a coating of snow on the roads but hardly any vehicles were traveling on them, as residents seemed content to stay indoors and monitor the storm in comfort. Most businesses in the area had gone dark, including some convenience stores and gas stations. Earlier in the day, Nicole Coelho, a nanny from Lyndhurst, New Jersey, stocked up on macaroni and cheese, frozen pizzas and milk at a supermarket. \\"I'm going to make sure to charge up my cellphone, and I have a good book I haven't gotten around to reading yet,\\" she said. Ben Shickel went grocery shopping in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and found shelves had been cleaned out. \\"We're used to these big snowstorms in New England, but 2 to 3 feet all at once and 50 to 60 mph winds? That's a different story,\\" he said. Last minute shoppers filed into the Jersey City ShopRite Monday evening, looking to stock up before the brunt of the storm hit. \\"I heard it's supposed to be snowing for two days straight, so we plan on staying inside and munching,\\" said 18-year old Christian Waiters, who serves in the military. On Wall Street, however, the New York Stock Exchange stayed open and said it would operate normally Tuesday as well. Coastal residents braced for a powerful storm surge and the possibility of damaging flooding and beach erosion, particularly in New Jersey and on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Officials in New Jersey shore towns warned people to move their cars off the streets and away from the water. Utility companies across the region put additional crews on standby to deal with anticipated power outages. ___ Associated Press writers Dave Collins and Pat Eaton-Robb in Hartford, Connecticut; David Porter in Lyndhurst, New Jersey; Jim Fitzgerald in White Plains; Bruce Shipkowski in Trenton, New Jersey; Deepti Hajela, Jonathan Lemire, Verena Dobnik and Mike Balsamo in New York; Albert Stumm in Philadelphia; and Marcy Gordon and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| BOSTON/NEW YORK A U.S. blizzard swept past New York City and struck hardest at some 4.5 million people around Boston, dropping nearly three feet of snow in areas and triggering high tides that breached a seawall and forced residents to flee their coastal homes. The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut lifted travel bans they had imposed a day earlier and New York City's subway system restarted after being closed for 10 hours, but officials urged people to stay off snow-covered roadways. The snow was forecast to continue into early Wednesday morning in eastern New England, which could set a new snowfall record in Boston, where 20.8 inches (53 cm) of snow was already on the ground early afternoon, often piled higher by strong winds. \\"There are drifts now of four, five and six feet in some places,\\" Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told reporters. Boston-area subways would remain closed for at least the rest of the day, Baker said. Storm-driven coastal flooding added to the state's woes, with low-lying towns south of Boston seeing flood damage. High tides breached a seawall in Marshfield, Massachusetts, about 30 miles (50 km) south of Boston, damaging 11 homes, several of which were condemned, police said. Waves were splashing over the damaged seawall by afternoon and local police urged residents of the area to evacuate before the next high tide, expected at 5 p.m. ET. Denise Gorham, 57, said she spent the morning watching a heavy wooden shed filled with six window air conditioners float away on waters that surrounded the house after the breach. \\"It's been horrible. I've been here 12 years and we've weathered every single storm. It was just like the ocean was on the street itself,\\" said Gorham, a writer, who was trying to keep warm over her fireplace after the power went out. The heaviest snowfall was recorded outside Boston, with 32.5 inches (83 cm) reported in Auburn, Massachusetts, and 30 inches (76.2 cm) reported in Framingham. Authorities were also working to restore power at the resort island of Nantucket, off Massachusetts, where most homes and businesses had lost power early in the day, Baker said. Some 45,900 customers across the storm-hit region were without power, according to local utilities, with the bulk of the outages on Massachusetts' Cape Cod and outlying islands. Police said a teenager died late on Monday when he crashed into a lamppost on a street where he was snow-tubing in the New York City suburb of Suffolk County, on the east end of Long Island, which saw more than two feet of snow in places. 'THEY ALWAYS MESS UP' New Yorkers were divided on whether officials had over-reacted in ordering dramatic shutdowns ahead of the storm. The city shut its subway system for about 10 hours, the first time in its history that it did so due to snow. \\"The mayor was going based on the meteorologists. The meteorologists, they always mess up, it's not an exact science,\\" said Vincent Pierce, 34, as he walked his bulldog on a snow-free Manhattan sidewalk. Others were frustrated that officials had preemptively shut the subway and ordered cabs off the roads. \\"This made it a little difficult to go to my job. I usually take a taxi, but no taxis today,\\" said Greg Noble, 29, as he walked briskly to his maintenance job some 30 city blocks from his Manhattan home. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo defended the decisions, which had included a driving ban in New York City and its surrounding counties overnight. \\"I would rather, if there is a lean one way or another, lean towards safety because I have seen the consequences the other way and it gets very frightening very quickly ... we have had people die in storms,\\" Cuomo told reporters. \\"I would rather be in a situation where we say 'We got lucky.'\\" SNOWFALL CONTINUES The National Weather Service lifted its blizzard warning for the New York City area, but throughout the region offices were closed, schools were shut, some roads remained impassable, and thousands of flights were canceled or delayed. A blizzard warning remained in effect for much of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and parts of Maine, where snow was expected to fall throughout the day at a rate as high as 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) an hour. Boston could receive up to 25 inches (64 cm) of accumulation, approaching the record of 27.5 inches (69.85 cm) set in February 2003. Stuck at home, Northeasterners spent their time on social media, filling Twitter and Facebook with photos of snow drifts covering the doors of their homes and what appeared to be a person in Boston dressed as the Yeti, a mythical abominable snowman, on hashtags including \\"#snowmaggeddon2015\\" and \\"#blizzardof2015.\\" More than 4,700 U.S. flights were canceled on Tuesday, according to FlightAware.com, with more than 80 percent of scheduled flights at airports in New York, Philadelphia and Boston affected. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered schools to re-open on Wednesday and Broadway's theaters planned to open their doors on Tuesday night as the city began to return to normal. The New York Stock Exchange, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, opened as usual. Nasdaq OMX Group and BATS Global Markets had normal operating hours on Tuesday.

Cheri Jacobus filed a 4 million suit against Trump in April, saying her business was harmed after Trump tweeted about her. Jacobus was briefly engaged in talks with the Trump campaign, but never signed on to work with the team, and later publicly spoke about the race. On Feb. 5, Trump blasted Jacobus, calling her \\"really dumb.\\" He said she went \\"hostile\\" after he \\"turned her down twice,\\" and ended his tweet on a high note: \\"Major loser, zero credibility!\\" Judge Barbara Jaffe ruled that Trump's tweets were opinion, and could not be measured as factual. It was important to take into context the \\"heated rhetoric\\" during a \\"particularly raucous Republican primary,\\" she wrote in a 20-page ruling, and acknowledged that \\"truth itself has been lost in the cacophony of online and Twitter verbiage to such a degree that it seems to roll of the consciousness like water off a duck's back.\\" She minced no words when it came time to describe Trump's greatest hits of Twitter burns, calling his constant use of \\"loser,\\" \\"total loser,\\" and \\"totally biased loser\\" a sign his account is \\"rife with vague and simplistic insults.\\" Jay Butterman, an attorney for Jacobus, said the ruling gave Trump — who as of Election Day has 75 lawsuits open — a \\"free pass to trample on the rights of free speech of any critic,\\" and will be appealed. \\"[This is] a say day for free speech, a sad day for freedom of the press, and a sad day for democracy,\\" he told USA Today. Catherine Garcia ||||| And on Tuesday, local and state officials were left to defend one of the most consequential decisions elected leaders can make: effectively closing a city, in light of an uncertain forecast. Advertisement Continue reading the main story With travel bans instituted across the region, residents had little choice but to heed the warnings to stay put. Even as roads reopened and trains creaked back to life early Tuesday, there would be no normal business day, even though most parts of the city received less than 10 inches of snow, not the two to three feet that had been predicted. The weather laid bare the civic and political high-wire act of the modern snowstorm — pocked with doomsayer proclamations and sporadic lapses in communication. Slide Show At the episode’s heart is the sort of damned-if-you-do decision that has bedeviled politicians for decades: Play it safe with closings, all but guaranteeing sweeping economic losses, or try to ride out the storm? “I would much rather be in a situation where we say we got lucky than one where we didn’t get lucky and somebody died,” Mr. Cuomo said. Briefings and interviews with officials suggest that recent challenges — including Hurricane Sandy, a snowstorm in Buffalo and public spats between top local leaders and forecasters — have left decision-makers even more risk-averse. As the storm approached, a sort of one-upmanship theater had visited the local political stage: Mr. Cuomo’s announcement about the subway shutdown came hours after the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority suggested a full shutdown was unlikely. New Jersey Transit riders were told on Monday afternoon not to expect rail service until Thursday. Photo On Sunday, Mr. de Blasio said, “This could be the biggest snowstorm in the history of New York City,” a bit of speechmaking that spawned a widely distributed parody in The Onion: “NYC Mayor: ‘Reconcile Yourselves With Your God, for All Will Perish in the Tempest.’ ” (On Tuesday, the mayor gave a reading of the article for reporters at City Hall.) The abundance of caution was perhaps understandable, particularly in this city. Last year, shortly after taking office, Mr. de Blasio drew the ire of snowbound residents on an under-plowed Upper East Side. Weeks later, amid criticism that he left schools open in a heavy storm, the mayor, a Democrat, appeared to deflect blame to a shifting forecast, setting off a dispute with the television weatherman Al Roker. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For this storm, the sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia, first heard about the dire forecasts on Saturday afternoon. She thought the projection by the National Weather Service — possibly three or four inches of snow per hour by Monday night — was a misprint. “Can you get on National Weather,” Ms. Garcia recalled telling aides, “and find out what the hell they’re saying?” Video In their storm preparations, according to an official, Mr. de Blasio and his staff alluded often to two predecessors: Michael R. Bloomberg, who was blamed in 2010 for snowed-in streets outside Manhattan, and John V. Lindsay, who faced withering criticism after a storm that killed 42 people in the city in 1969. The message seemed clear: A failed snowstorm response sticks with a mayor. And Mr. de Blasio would not be seen as underprepared. “This is not going to be like other snowstorms,” the mayor told reporters on Monday. Across the Hudson River, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican considering a run for president, trumpeted his experience with weather emergencies. On Sunday, while he was at his son’s hockey game in Bayonne, a resident asked if he was worried about the storm, he said. “We’ve had Hurricane Irene, we’ve had Hurricane Sandy,” Mr. Christie said, recalling the conversation on Monday. “For better or for worse, we know how to deal with these situations.” For New York State officials, though, recent missteps loomed. Mr. Cuomo cited the seven feet of snow that recently hit Buffalo, a storm he said the state had underestimated because of sliding forecasts. Meteorologists also criticized Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, for second-guessing their projections at the time. On Tuesday, the governor was more measured — “forecasters do the best they can, and we respond to the best information that they have,” he said — though he noted that the state had announced plans to create its own weather system that would deliver more precise information on impending storms. By early Monday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo had prepared residents for the possibility of road closings and limited transit service. But though officials had warned of a possible subway shutdown, Thomas F. Prendergast, the transportation authority chairman, suggested that underground service was likely to continue. “We’d be able to run trains,” he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hours later, Mr. Cuomo, saying the forecast had worsened for some parts of the region, announced the subway shutdown. Amid questions over whether the governor had ordered the move himself, Mr. Prendergast later said he had recommended it, citing the 2010 blizzard that left many trains and buses stranded in the snow. Noting that many subway lines go both above and below ground, Mr. Prendergast said Tuesday that it would have been unwise to run fractured service, potentially stranding passengers along the way. “For somebody who knows an awful lot about this system, as I do, I’m a little surprised I said what I did,” Mr. Prendergast said of his initial comments on keeping service running. He also said regular service was able to return more quickly because of the shutdown. The announcement, though, mirrored an episode from the fall, when Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie introduced a mandatory quarantine policy for those who had come into contact with Ebola patients. City Hall, overseeing the care of an Ebola patient at the time, was not notified in that case, infuriating health officials. Discussing the subway shutdown on Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio said such “an unprecedented decision” was “certainly something we would have liked to have some more dialogue on.” While the mayor did not criticize the subway decision itself, many residents were less kind. Across the city, tales of commutes upended and Tuesdays disrupted — a doorman on a graveyard shift with no way to travel, tourists from Tuscany barred from Central Park — predominated. “I woke up this morning and I was like, that’s it?” said Kamolnadda Thumrongluck, 25, carrying a snowboard through Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy & Management at New York University, joked that the storm in the city was a triumph of government. “They were able to conjure a snowstorm that didn’t occur,” Mr. Moss said, praising local officials for overpreparing. “We won a battle without an enemy.” ||||| Residents in some areas of Long Island are digging out from more than two feet of snow after receiving the brunt of this week's winter storm.In Suffolk County, many roads were still snow-covered and treacherous Wednesday, and East Hampton remains under a state of emergency. Riverhead and Southold no longer have travel bans, but both recommend residents continue to stay off the roads.

The snow is still covering the LIRR tracks in Mattituck, where service won't be restored until at least Thursday. Meanwhile, the LIRR is still trying to restore full service, with stations east of Ronkonkoma working to clear snow off the tracks.Most lines were operating on a normal schedule, but there was no service between Montauk and Speonk or between Greenpoint and Ronkonkoma in the morning. Commuters needing to get to Penn Station had to drive to the Ronkonkoma station and pick up the train from there. Late Wednesday afternoon, normal weekday service was finally restored on the Montauk branch, with the 4:30 p.m. train from Hunterspoint Avenue the first eastbound train to operate east of Speonk.The railroad activated its 1.5 million, 80-ton snow spreading vehicle known as Darth Vader to try and clear the tracks, and employees have salted the walkways to keep the platforms safe for commuters. Still, there were numerous delays and cancellations Wednesday morning, in part due to a broken rail.Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone says towns and villages are doing their best to get side streets up and running in the aftermath of the blizzard. Bellone said Wednesday that plow operators and emergency responders have been praising the \\"very effective\\" decision to close the roads to the public during the height of the storm. He noted that there could be more snow every few days in the weeks to come, and he says officials are working to give Long Island's hard-hit east end whatever assets it needs.There were at least two suspected storm-related deaths on Long Island.Police say a teenager was killed while snow-tubing in Huntington Monday night.

Originally, forecasters predicted that the storm would be one of the worst ever seen, with prophesies of 1 to 3 feet of snow and punishing hurricane-like winds. Because of this, preparations were made to protect residents from the oncoming storm. However, these predictions did not quite live up to their expectations. Tens of millions of people along the Eastern Seaboard prepared for the storm, which spanned from Philadelphia to Boston. Major cities braced themselves for harsh conditions, and as a result, life abruptly came to a standstill across the region. Workers were ordered to go home early, travel was banned, bridges and tunnels were closed, and the largest plowing crews were assembled. Sandy beaches were reinforced in anticipation of the storm surge and residents were advised to stay indoors. New York was one of the most affected cities. People in the thousands in the Northeast prepared for a snowstorm that was predicted to make history. Pedestrians braved snow-covered paths while others enjoyed small snow mounds in popular areas like Times Square. The snow also caused a major disruption in public transportation with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses taking breaks due to the snow-covered roads. Walking along the snow-covered paths became the norm for locals during these days. New England was also heavily affected with snow beginning to fall in areas like Acushnet, Massachusetts. Snow also fell around popular city landmarks like the Empire State Building and Boston Common. The city streets were cleared as snow continued to precipitate. However, as early as Tuesday, the severity of the predictions was downgraded. While New England was still expected to bear the brunt of the storm, it was not expected to be as bad as it was earlier predicted. Cities like Boston and Providence, Rhode Island were expected to get the most snow, about 2 feet. New York was to witness between 10 to 20 inches, while places like Hartford, Connecticut, Philadelphia, and central New Jersey were to experience around 6 inches of snowfall. In the end, even though the predictions were not as severe as initially forecast, the storm still resulted in a major disruption of daily life in these regions. Schools and businesses were shut down, flights were canceled, grocery stores were raided for supplies, and some officials even urged residents to stay at home. Despite the downgrade in weather predictions, the storm nonetheless served as an important reminder of the unpredictability of weather patterns and the need for preparedness in the face of severe weather scenarios."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: With lessons learned from the Sanderson series, Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects. He was on the point of launching this project, having invested 1,000 of his own money (equal to 25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series. In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls. Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home. Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co. With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York.

The two kings wanted to unite their armies in order to retake the city of Ramoth-gilead from the Arameans. Before embarking on this battle, King Jehoshaphat sought guidance from the Lord, as he was a God-fearing king, unlike his new ally, King Ahab, who was known for worshipping false gods. King Ahab gathered 400 false prophets who were loyal to him and his idols, asking them if they should proceed with the battle against Ramoth-gilead.

Jehoshaphat, however, felt uneasy about the unanimous decision of the 400 prophets. He suspected that they might not be sharing the true word of the Lord. Consequently, he asked Ahab if there was a true prophet of the Lord who could confirm or contradict the prediction of victory. Ahab reluctantly revealed the existence of Micaiah, a genuine prophet of the Lord, whom Ahab despised due to his tendency to prophesy unfavorable outcomes for the Israelite king. Micaiah was summoned to give his prophecy, and at first, he sarcastically agreed with the false prophets, assuring the kings that they would indeed succeed in their mission. Jehoshaphat noticed Micaiah's sarcasm and urged him to tell the truth. Micaiah, then, prophesied that not only would the campaign fail, but it would also result in the death of King Ahab. Micaiah's prophecy came true, as Ahab was killed in the battle, and the alliance between Israel and Judah failed to conquer Ramoth-gilead. This story conveys several important messages, including the significance of seeking the Lord's guidance before making critical decisions, as well as the importance of discerning between true and false prophets or teachings. Additionally, it serves as a reminder that the presence of a single honest and faithful individual, like Micaiah, can overcome the influence of numerous untruthful people, even when they vastly outnumber the former."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The answer to the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn? is inside the article: John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn is John Michael Wright. His biographer, Verne, accepted the epithet of Scotsman for Wright, who was a well-known portrait painter. There is uncertainty around his origin as some sources claim London birth, while others associate him with Scotland.

President Barack Obama dismissed criticism he doesn't spend enough time developing relationships with Washington deal-makers who can help push his agenda forward. In an exclusive interview with CNN chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin, Obama said he is determined to make time for his family. \\"Sometimes Michelle and I not doing the circuit and going out to dinners with folks is perceived as us being cool,\\" Obama said. \\"It actually really has more to do with us being parents.\\" The president has been criticized from all sides for failing to achieve more bipartisanship, especially given his 2008 campaign pledge to bridge partisan and ideological divides once in office. Some of the president's frustrated allies have complained that a seeming reluctance to build relationships with more members of Congress and Washington insiders has made it difficult for him to get business done. Romney gets more personal. In the interview, which will air as part of the documentary \\"Obama Revealed: The Man, The President,\\" Obama suggested he is willing to build those relationships, but often turns down social engagements because he prioritizes time at home with his children. \\"Sometimes on the weekends, we may turn down the invitation to this or that or the other just because we're trying to carve out family time,\\" Obama said. \\"And I think that's sometimes interpreted as me not wanting to be out there slapping backs and wheeling and dealing. That really has more to do with just the stage we are in our lives.\\" Asked if things would change if he's elected to a second term, Obama said, \\"My hope is that getting past this election, people will have an opportunity to maybe step back and say, 'You know what? The differences that divide us aren't as important as the common bonds we have as Americans.' \\" \\"And some of that I'm sure will require additional effort on my part. Hopefully, we'll see more effort on the other side, as well,\\" he added. David Maraniss, who penned biographies of former President Bill Clinton and Obama, said the current president \\"is not going to become this great transactional politician,\\" like Clinton. \\"Bill Clinton was imbalanced. He would spend the hours between 6:00 and 9:00 (p.m.) talking to people in Congress,\\" Maraniss said. \\"Whereas President Obama is basically with his family during those hours, which is sort of a balanced thing to do but not necessarily good for a president.\\" One of the president's closest friends and aides, Valerie Jarrett, said Obama \\"wants to be the kind of dad he never had.\\" The president has been slammed by Republicans for what they consider an unwillingness to compromise, particularly in legislative matters. Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, who worked closely with the president early in his term, said she is not sure Obama \\"truly understands the relationship and interaction that occurs between the president and the legislative branch.\\" \\"Somehow, he thinks, well, the Congress is, you know, that's their job and this is my job,\\" Snowe said. \\"But we have to really interact with one another, ultimately, to get the job done for the country.\\" The president said he repeatedly reached out across the aisle in the hope of achieving bipartisan solutions, even at the expense of condemnation from members of his own party. It was the GOP, he said, that made reaching across party lines nearly impossible. \\"If anything, I think I received a lot of criticism from my own party for going out of my way to try to solicit Republican cooperation,\\" Obama said. \\"The fact of the matter was that politically there was a decision that was made fairly early on, among some of their leadership, that said working with the president is not good politics.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"President Obama gave an interview to CNN and spoke about balancing his work as a president with being a parent.

There are some aspects about the app that I enjoyed, but there are other areas where I feel improvements could be made. Here's my 3-star review breakdown: Pros: 1. Interface: The app's interface is quite user-friendly and it's easy to browse through my comic collection. The layout is straightforward and it did not take much time for me to get the hang of it. 2. Speed: Generally, the app works smoothly and loads my comics fairly quickly. Reading each page is a breeze, and there have been no major hiccups with page transitions. Cons: 1. Limited supported formats: One issue I found with this app is that it only supports a few formats of comics. Expanding support for more file formats could make the app more versatile and convenient for a wider range of users. 2. Lack of customization: Another drawback is the limited customization options available. It would be great if there were more settings to adjust the reading experience, like customizing background colors, adjusting brightness, or having various page-turning effects. 3. Infrequent updates and support: Lastly, it seems that updates to the app and support for resolving issues are quite infrequent. More frequent updates and better customer support would go a long way in improving the overall user experience. In conclusion, the net.kervala.comicsreader app is decent for basic comic reading, but it could benefit from additional features and improvements for a more well-rounded experience. Given that it is a free app, the current offering isn't too bad, but if the developers put in some work to polish the app and address its shortcomings, it could easily become a favorite among comic enthusiasts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Warner is removed from suspicion. for the following movie plot: Vincent Price and Gavin Gordon in The Bat Cornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) is a mystery author who lives in a town terrorized by a mysterious murderer known only as \\"The Bat\\". The Bat is said to be a man with no face who murders women at night by ripping out their throats with steel claws. Early in the film, The Bat enters Van Gorder's house and releases a bat, which bites van Gorder's maid Lizzy (Lenita Lane). With Lizzy in a panic, fearing she may now have contracted \\"the rabies\\", an outbreak of which local papers have reported, Van Gorder calls her doctor, Dr Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price), who is conducting research on bats. Meanwhile, the whole town is searching for a million-dollar stash of looted bank securities that were recently stolen. Dr. Wells discovers the location of the treasure when the thief confides in him. Wells then murders the thief in cold blood, presumably so that he can take the treasure for himself, which he believes to be hidden in van Gorder's house. A series of break-ins and murders by The Bat brings the local chief of detectives, Andy Anderson (Gavin Gordon) to the Van Gorder house. The Bat then murders two people in the Van Gorder house, Mark Fleming (John Bryant) and Judy Hollander (Darla Hood). Anderson attempts to determine the identity of The Bat, suspecting both Wells and Van Gorder's new butler, Warner (John Sutton).

Here is the step-by-step process. Step 1: Read and analyze the provided information. The information states that after the House debates a law, they either approve it and send it to the Senate, or reject it and return it to the government. Step 2: Confirm the correctness of the provided information. The provided information is an accurate representation of a typical legislative process, where the House of Representatives debates a bill and decides to either approve or reject it. If approved, the bill will proceed to the Senate, and if rejected, it is sent back to the government. Step 3: Derive an answer that addresses the question. The question asks what is written and sent to the government if the Senate approves the law after receiving it from the House. Since the information provided does not specify what happens within the Senate and the communication that follows, we can only infer based on typical legislative processes. Step 4: Provide a justified response. Based on the typical legislative process and the details provided about the House, we can infer that if the Senate approves a law that has already been approved by the House, the Senate will likely send the approved bill back to the government along with a notification message stating that both chambers have approved the proposal. The exact text may vary depending on the specific legislative process followed by the government in question.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love. Why did the writer's wife leave him? - not enough information - The writer was too unpleasant and difficult to love. - She was unhappy in the marriage and met someone else who she fell in love with. - Her family persuaded her to do it. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it seems that there could be multiple reasons why the writer's wife left him. One possible reason is that the writer admits to being not an easy person to love, which might have made it difficult for his wife to be happy in the marriage. Another reason could be that she met someone else (the so-called friend) and fell in love with him, leading her to leave the marriage for a new relationship. It is also possible that the opinions of her family may have had an influence on her decision, but there is not enough information to confirm this. Overall, it seems that a combination of factors like the writer's difficult nature, her newfound relationship, and potentially her family's views contributed to the wife's decision to leave the marriage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. and a hint : Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet.

Article: Watching TV is a very popular pastime in the prefix = st1 /UKbut what kind of programmes do British people like to watch? Well, the most-watched TV programmes every week are very popular dramas that are usually on at least four times every week. They are dramas based in one neighbourhood that try to describe ordinary life in theUK--- we call these dramas 'soap operas' or 'soaps'. In the early days of TV, there were often dramas on during the day. Back in those days, it was traditional for the husband to go out to work and for the wife to stay at home and look after the house and the children. Most of these daytime dramas were aimed at entertaining the housewives who would traditionally be at home, probably doing the washing. Companies selling washing powder would advertise their products at times when these dramas were on, and sometimes those companies would even sponsor the drama. Hence the word 'soap'. So what about the word opera? Well, that's because these dramas are often an exaggeration of real life. They are supposed to represent ordinary life but to make them entertaining, lots of dramatic events like murders, divorces, affairs etc. all happen probably much more regularly than they would in a normal neighbourhood. Most soap operas these days are shown in the evening. Each show will have several different storylines happening at once that continue over several shows. The same _ will appear in every show too. There are lots of different soaps on in theUKon different channels but there are three main popular ones. 'Coronation Street' has been on since 1960. It is set in a suburb of Manchester and it's supposed to represent working class life in the north ofEngland.

Here is an article: Ten years ago, the bombing of two nightclubs in Bali resulted in 202 deaths and unsettled the long-peaceful island popular with Western tourists. On Friday, hundreds of survivors and their families gathered in Bali to remember the bombing, a devastating attack that mobilized Indonesia against terrorism. Grieving families laid wreaths, scattered flower petals and cupped candles in prayer before a memorial monument. Thousands of police and military personnel guarded the gathering, watchful for a new attack. At one of Bali's famed beaches, surfers took to their boards for a “Paddle for Peace.” Bombing victims included people from more than two dozen countries, including Australians, Indonesians, Britons, Americans and Swedes. The attack shook governments allied with the West; U.S. officials feared the bombing was part of a new global spasm of terrorist attacks. As the 10th anniversary neared this week, Indonesian police said they had detected a new terror threat, but the news didn’t seem to deter the crowds bearing candles and flowers Friday. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard insisted she wanted to be in Bali on the fateful date, remembering “the worst terrorist attack our nation has ever known.” “Perhaps there is a grim reassurance in knowing that the terrorists did not achieve what they set out to do,” Gillard said in a speech at the memorial service. “They did not undermine Indonesian democracy, which has only grown stronger across the passage of a decade. And though our vigilance is greater, we have not surrendered the freedoms that brought us here in the first place.” In the wake of the attack, Bali reeled economically as tourists steered clear of the island. Just as it began to recover, a second attack nearly three years later killed dozens of people, again shattering its sense of security. The Indonesian president at the time, Megawati Sukarnoputri, was accused of doing too little to combat extremism until it exploded into view. In response to the attack, the country passed new laws against terrorism. It pinned the crimes on a group tied to Al Qaeda and cracked down on the network. Three men were ultimately convicted and executed in connection with the 2002 attack; hundreds more alleged militants were arrested in a broader crackdown on terrorism across Indonesia. Like Gillard, sitting Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono declared that the bombing had failed to achieve its desired effect, arguing in a Sydney Morning Herald column that it galvanized the country to quash terror. Terror networks in Indonesia are now feeble and fractured, yet they are still at work, experts say. Extremists have hatched more than a dozen plots since 2010, the International Crisis Group said in a recent report. Though Indonesian police have foiled many of their attempts, the government hasn’t stopped terrorist groups from continuing to recruit new members, the group warned. Extremists can easily crisscross the country, buying airline tickets under false names, it said. Another militant group was discovered in Jakarta last month. Leery of returning to the restrictive rules in place under longtime autocrat Suharto, the government has also shied away from criminalizing speech that incites people to violence, said Sidney Jones, Asia program director for the International Crisis Group. Vandalizing churches or other lesser acts of violence have gone unpunished. “It becomes a green light to go on to further levels of violence,” Jones said.

A pony bit me earlier.\\" As it happened, the bite was virtually painless: more the kind of small bite you might get from a naughty child. The pony responsible was queuing up for some ice cream in the car park near Haytor, and perhaps thought I'd jumped in ahead of him. The reason why the ponies here are naughty is that Haytor is a tourist-heavy area and tourists are constantly feeding the ponies foods, despite sighs asking them not to. By feeding the ponies, tourists increase the risk of them getting hit by a car, and make them harder to gather during the area's annual pony drift . The purpose of a pony drift is to gather them up so their health can be checked, the baby ones can be stooped from feeding on their mother's milk, and those who've gone beyond their limited area can be returned to their correct area. Some of them are also later sold, in order to limit the number of ponies according to the rules set by Natural England. Three weeks ago, I witnessed a small near-disaster a few mils west of here. While walking, I noticed a pony roll over on his back. \\"Hello!\\" I said to him, assuming he was just rolling for fun, but he was very still and, as I got closer, I saw him kicking his legs in the air and breathing heavily. I began to properly worry about him. Fortunately, I managed to get in touch with a Dartmoor's Livestock Protection officer and send her a photo.

The Hokkaido Prefectural Police say that Yamato's comments in an hour-long interview jibed with what father Takayuki Tanooka and his wife told authorities about deciding to leave the boy alone in the forest for a few minutes on May 28 as punishment for throwing rocks; Yamato was found six days later. The AP reports the case may still be transferred to a local children's welfare center. A rep with the Hakodate Children's Welfare Center had no comment. As for Yamato being fine, the AP reports that while he went without food for the length of his time in the woods (tap water was available in the military training ground hut where he sought shelter), he suffered only mild dehydration and had some insignificant bruises on an arm and his legs. He told those gathered outside the hospital that he is eager to go back to school and take part in a school sports day. The BBC notes that in a Monday interview, the boy's father recounted a conversation he had with his child in which he apologized for making him \\"go though such a hard time.\\" The boy's reply, per Tanooka: \\"You are a good dad.

With television cameras focused on him, the resilient young survivor waved and assured a reporter, \\"I am fine.\\" On May 28, Yamato's parents left him alone in the forest as punishment for throwing rocks. Unable to find their son, they soon alerted the authorities, sparking a massive search operation that ended with Yamato being found six days later. The Hokkaido Prefectural Police interviewed Yamato and his parents, father Takayuki Tanooka and his wife, for an hour to determine the facts of the case. The consistency of their accounts regarding the incident led the police to rule out child-neglect charges. However, the Associated Press (AP) reports that the case may still be transferred to a local children's welfare center, as the Hakodate Children's Welfare Center remains tight-lipped on the matter. Yamato disappeared on May 28 after his parents decided to teach him a lesson for throwing rocks at people and cars. Intending to leave him in the forest for only a few minutes, they soon lost sight of their son, leading to a desperate search for the young boy supported by the authorities, volunteers, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. On June 3, in a much-celebrated stroke of luck, Yamato was discovered in a hut on military training grounds approximately 5.5 kilometers from where he was initially abandoned. Yamato emerged from the ordeal relatively unscathed and in good health, having survived without food for the duration of his time in the woods. Tap water was available to him in the hut where he had sought shelter, which contributed to his well-being during his time alone. He only suffered mild dehydration and had a few insignificant bruises on his arm and legs, showing the incredible fortitude of the young boy. Yamato revealed his excitement to return to school and participate in a school sports day, undeterred by the harrowing experience. According to the BBC, the boy's father recalled a conversation he had with his son in which he apologized to Yamato for \\"making him go through such a hard time.\\" Remarkably, the boy's response to his father was, \\"You are a good dad.

Title: Pointless Review: The original 1976 film wasn't exactly a classic, in my opinion, so why on earth bother to do an almost shot for shot remake of a mediocre film? Perhaps it is the (mostly American) obsession with the Apocalypse and the End of Time (just read one of those dreadful, poorly written LEFT BEHIND books) that caused FOX to think this might be a money maker. It is slow, boreing, breaks no new ground and is an insult to the intelligence of the audience. A complete waste of time. Answer:","completion":"The customer review suggests that the customer is decidedly dissatisfied with the product—in this case, presumably a film. They expressed this dissatisfaction through the use of critical language and negative phrases throughout the review. Here are some examples to highlight: 1. The title itself is a first indicator of dissatisfaction. It is marked as \\"Pointless\\", thereby explicitly showcasing the customer's disappointment with the film. 2. The reviewer does not deem the original 1976 film as a classic, implying their discontentment from the start, since they believe the remake is of a film they didn’t consider impressive to begin with. 3. A strong hint of dissatisfaction is found in the question \\"why on earth bother to do an almost shot for shot remake of a mediocre film?\\" Strong words like \\"why on earth\\" and \\"mediocre\\" reveal a lack of joy and approval. 4. When they mention that the film might have been made with the motive of making money, it signals a feeling of being exploited as an audience member. This is not a positive sentiment and suggests dissatisfaction. 5. The pace of the movie is described as \\"slow\\" and \\"boring\\", and the reviewer claims it \\"breaks no new ground\\". These are solid signs of a poor and dreary experience. 6. The reviewer states that the film is \\"an insult to the intelligence of the audience\\". This highlights the significant displeasure experienced, as they feel the film disrespected their intellect. 7. Lastly, the reviewer concludes the review by calling the film \\"A complete waste of time\\". This conclusive statement cements their overall dissatisfaction. Therefore, based on the language and critiques used throughout the review, it's clear that the customer did not enjoy their experience with this product and displays an evident dissatisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Tracy Caulkins is known as the first American to set an American record and win an American title in each of four swimming strokes : breaststroke, butterfly, backstroke, freestyle. Tracy Caulkins was born in Minnesota and lived in Iowa until she was six. She began swimming when she was eight, after the family had moved to Nashville, Tennessee. While unwilling at first to swim in cold water or get her face wet, she began to train in earnest as her talent became clear. Though her father worked for the public schools, the family sent her to a private school when the public schools could not accommodate her training schedule. At age 13, Tracy Caulkins took part in the trials for the 1976 Olympics, but did not make the team. She continued to win national and international titles, and was disappointed in 1980 when the U.S. didn't attend the Moscow Olympics. She continued to train and compete. In 1981, Tracy Caulkins began college, graduating in 1985. In college, she continued competing and training, though she had slowed down from her peak years. Caulkins trained especially hard for the 1984 Olympics, and not only made the team, but was captain of the swim team and at Los Angeles, won three gold medals and was named Sportswoman of the Year by the U.S. Olympic Committee. After that she retired from swimming, and was a commentator for swimming events as well as taking advantage of her fame to do business. Tracy Caulkins married Australian swimmer, Mark Stockwell, in 1991, their romance having begun at the 1984 Olympics when he jumped into a warm-up pool to introduce himself. They married in Nashville and moved to Australia, where they had three children. Caulkins continued to be professionally involved in sports. Question: When was Tracy Caulkins born?

Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population. Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%. With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The University of Tirana is the oldest university in Albania, having been founded in October 1957. Question: \\"Were there any universities in Albania prior to the establishment of the People's Republic?\\" Answer: \\"No\\" Is this answer correct?

This means there were no universities in Albania prior to the establishment of the People's Republic in 1945. The high illiteracy rate and the scarcity of schools between World War I and World War II also indicate that higher education institutions, such as universities, were not present in the country during that time."},{"prompt":"Article: Recently we asked for people's opinions about paying students to encourage them to come to class and get higher scores on tests.

Mageau survives; Ferrin dies. One month later, the San Francisco Chronicle receives encrypted letters written by the killer calling himself the \\"Zodiac\\" and taunting the police. Political cartoonist Robert Graysmith is not taken seriously by crime reporter Paul Avery or the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings despite his interest in the case. When the newspaper publishes the letters, a married couple is able to decipher one. At a local bar, Avery initially makes fun of Graysmith before they discuss the coded letters. Graysmith interprets the letter, which Avery finds helpful, and Avery begins sharing information. The Zodiac killer attacks law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard at Lake Berryessa in Napa County on September 27, 1969. Shepard dies two days later, and Hartnell survives. One of Graysmith's insights about the letters is that the Zodiac's reference to man as \\"the most dangerous animal of them all\\" is a reference to the story and film The Most Dangerous Game (which features General Zaroff as a man who hunts live human prey). The fact that both Zaroff's surname and the name \\"Zodiac\\" start with a \\"Z\\" also seems significant. Two weeks later, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city's Presidio Heights district immediately after dropping the killer off.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. NASA launches Maven orbiter to probe mysteries in Mars' air Alan Boyle, Science Editor NBC News NASA launched its Maven orbiter on Monday to begin a journey that could unravel the mysteries surrounding Mars' past and current atmosphere — and perhaps reveal how the planet lost its life-friendly environment. A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket rose from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 41 in Florida at 1:28 p.m. ET, carrying the probe into space to kick off its 671 million mission. \\"Hey, guys, we're going to Mars!\\" Bruce Jakosky, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado who serves as Maven's principal investigator, declared afterward. If all goes according to schedule, the bus-sized, 2.7-ton spacecraft will enter Martian orbit next September to study the Red Planet's upper atmosphere over the course of at least one Earth year. What happened on Mars?\\"Maven\\" is an acronym that stands for Mars Atmophere and Volatile EvolutioN. The mission's objective is to help scientists figure out how the Red Planet's environment changed from a warm, moist place into the chilly wasteland it is today. Previous missions — including NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been working on Red Planet's surface for more than a year — have found ample geological evidence that Mars had enough liquid water on its surface to be hospitable to life billions of years ago. That's not the case anymore. \\"Something clearly happened,\\" Jakosky said. Great egrets take flight as an Atlas 5 rocket blasts off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 41 in Florida on Monday, carrying NASA's Maven spacecraft into space. The leading hypothesis is that Mars was too small to hang onto its global magnetic field over the long term. As a result, the planet lost the kind of magnetic shield that protects Earth's atmosphere from the damaging effects of solar radiation. In this scenario, electrically charged particles from the sun stripped away Mars' air from the top, leaving behind a carbon dioxide atmosphere that's only 1 percent as dense as Earth's. That kind of atmosphere can't retain heat, shield the surface from radiation or sustain liquid water. There are also hints that some of Mars' atmospheric CO2 was locked up as carbonates in the Red Planet's rocks. How much was stripped away from above, and how much was locked up below? \\"We can't go back and study what happened over 4 billion years,\\" Jakosky told reporters, \\"but we can go and look at how these processes are operating today, and how the processes have changed over time.\\" Maven's array of nine sensors, built into eight scientific instruments, can monitor the solar radiation hitting the top of Mars' atmosphere, gauge the current rate of atmospheric loss, and map the planet's localized, jumbled-up magnetic \\"umbrellas.\\" Scientists plan to factor in all those readings to produce better models for the global climate shift that swept over Mars — and changed the odds for life in the process. A team playerMaven won't be working in isolation: It will be joining three other orbiters and two surface rovers that are already on the job at Mars. Yet another orbiter — India's Mars Orbiter Mission, also known as the Mangalyaan probe — was launched earlier this month and is due to reach Martian orbit just after Maven's arrival. The teams for Maven and Mangalyaan plan to collaborate in their studies of the Red Planet's atmosphere. For instance, there's been some evidence that methane is being released into the Martian atmosphere, which could hint at biological activity. Curiosity hasn't detected any methane at the surface, and Maven won't be measuring methane because that doesn't mesh with the mission's scientific goals. But Mangalyaan can take a closer look at the methane question, and its results could add to Maven's models. Maven is destined to be a team player in another sense: NASA's current Mars orbiters are well into their extended missions, and if one of them fails, Maven can help with the task of relaying data between the rovers on the Martian surface and radio antennas back on Earth. That relay function was considered so essential that the Maven team was exempted from the effects of last month's government shutdown. The science team might give Maven yet another task: The spacecraft's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph could get pictures of Comet ISON, said the University of Colorado's Nick Schneider, who is the lead scientist for that instrument. \\"We should, if we have the time, get some really great observations,\\" he said. A key part of Maven's payload won't be used for observations at all, but will instead bring messages to Mars. The spacecraft carries a decorated DVD that contains the digital code for about 100,000 names, 377 student artworks and more than 1,100 haiku poems — all of which were submitted in response to the Maven team's public outreach campaign. One of the 17-syllable poems puts Maven's climate-centric mission into cosmic perspective: Amidst sand and starsWe scan a lifeless planetTo escape its fate Update for 5:45 p.m. ET Nov. 18: Mission managers voiced satisfaction over Maven's launch during a news briefing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. \\"So far, so good,\\" said the mission's project manager, David Mitchell of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The next major milestone comes on Dec. 3, when the Maven team plans to correct the spacecraft's trajectory if necessary and start activating its scientific instruments. Jakosky said Maven's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph could capture images of Comet ISON during the second week of December, after the comet's close encounter with the sun, \\"if everything goes smoothly.\\" Jakosky looked back at the years of effort he put into preparing for launch day. \\"After 10 years of doing this, I don't have the words to describe what I'm feeling,\\" he told reporters. \\"It's every possible emotion, but they're all positive.\\" That apparently wasn't the case before liftoff. \\"In the last 10 seconds before launch ... I was shaking,\\" Jakosky said. When he was asked whether the experience was comparable to the \\"seven minutes of terror\\" that the Curiosity rover's mission team experienced just before last year's landing, Jakosky kicked it up a notch. \\"I think for me, it's 10 years of terror,\\" he said. \\"There is no point at which you know it's occurred safely until it's occurred safely.\\" Jakosky joked that being the principal investigator for an interplanetary mission has been \\"the experience of a lifetime — and there's no way that I'll do it again.\\" NASA wants to do it again, however. The agency's administrator, Charles Bolden, praised the Maven team for giving the mission such a strong start while sticking within their budget. He said \\"I would hope that this mission will be a model for the ones that come after it,\\" including human trips to Mars beginning in the 2030s.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

To better understand the essential relationship between these three concepts, it is important to delve deeper into their individual roles and how they intertwine in the marvelous process of pollination. Bees are the primary pollinators in many ecosystems, facilitating the reproduction of various plant species. As they travel from one flower to another in search of food, they inadvertently transfer pollen onto the reproductive structures of the blooms. This exchange enables plants to produce seeds and fruit, ensuring the survival of various species and the continuation of genetic diversity within ecosystems. Different types of bees have evolved to specialize in pollinating specific plants, highlighting the intricate and delicate balance that exists between these creatures and their environment. Clusters, in this context, generally refer to groups of bees that gather together to achieve their objectives more effectively. They can be found working in concert to collect pollen and nectar or to build and maintain their hives. By clustering together, bees can communicate with one another, share information about food sources, and labor efficiently - ultimately enabling the colony to thrive. Clustering also provides protection, as bees can collectively respond to threats and defend their habitat when necessary. Flowers are the reproductive structures of plants, and they have evolved to be visually attractive and produce appealing scents to lure pollinators like bees. Within a flower, the pollen-producing anther is located near the pollen-receiving stigma, increasing the likelihood of successful pollination. Additionally, flowers offer nectar, a sweet, nutritious substance that serves as a vital food source for bees and other pollinators like butterflies and hummingbirds. As these creatures move from one flower to another in search of nourishment, they unwittingly transport pollen and contribute to the fertilization of other flowers, thereby ensuring the health and sustainability of their habitats. Thus, the sentence encompassing these concepts highlights the incredible dynamics at play between bees, clusters, and flowers in promoting the reproduction and survival of various plant species. This cooperative relationship is a prime example of the intricate connections between different organisms that enable the seamless functioning of the natural world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: At what number did the album that did not include the man who got rights to The Wall chart in the UK and US? ? In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\"Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.\\" Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name.

Answer the following question: This article: In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon. Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days. In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes. At a local ward luau, another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of Ammon, a missionary who teaches a group of people to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again. The night before his baptism, Carl buries his weapons in the yard and Elder Lozano baptizes him the following day. contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people that Carl tracks down for saving his life?, what is it ?

Reduced to a vulnerable state and indebted to the missionaries for saving his life, Carl seeks out Elder Farrell and Elder Lozano to express his gratitude after being discharged from the hospital.

Review: Anna Christie (1931) On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is if anything more commanding (or more beautiful as a screen presence) and her acting is more restrained. And she seems frankly more at ease, probably for a lot of reasons, but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture, so had adjusted quickly. Without comparing always one film to the other, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill play with too many words. His themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here, but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway. There are some scenes missing--the Coney Island section is shortened and isn't as good--but overall it's a direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), is simply redoing what was done already, which I assume must be a frustrating experience. It's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way (not only the sets, but the shots, are all the same). There is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film--some of the storm, understandably, but also a brief scene where Marie Dressler (from the English language version) is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal, drunk as can be. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is no replacing Dressler, for sure, but for me the German father is more believable and honest in his performance. Clearly the themes--immigration, wayward fathers, daughters turning to prostitution, and the troubles of finding true love--have strong currents back then, especially with European threads (Garbo, appropriately, plays a Swedish young woman). What is the sentiment of this review? Available options: 1). negative 2). positive","completion":"This review has a more positive sentiment. The reviewer mentions that this version of \\"Anna Christie\\" is toned down and refined, and Garbo's acting is more commanding and restrained compared to the English version.

Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images While the social and political consequences of racism might be familiar to convention viewers, they might be less aware of the financial cost of racial discrimination. Turns out, data suggests that it's not just people of color who would benefit financially from closing the racial wage gap in the United States: About 2 trillion in U.S. gross domestic product is lost because of race-based pay discrimination, research suggests. Both \\"The Business Case for Racial Equality,\\" a report published by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and \\"The Equity Solution: Racial Inclusion Is Key to Growing a Strong New Economy,\\" a study published by PolicyLink, estimate that America's GDP would increase by around 2 trillion annually — or by 14% — if the racial income gap were closed. There are a few explanations why that figure is so high. Lower wages overall generally translates into less consumption, which isn't good for businesses, and racial economic inequality can institutionalize racism by reinforcing fundamental political biases, PolicyLink argues. Furthermore, according to the W.K. Kellogg Foundation study, if people of color were to earn as much as white people in America, it would increase corporate profits and tax revenues — benefiting both the private and public sectors.

Moreover, the connection between the boy's celebration and the possible recycling of paint is not explicitly established.

For example, if the paint used in the celebration is mentioned to have been collected from a recycling center or if there is a reference to the paint being reused from previous occasions, then we might be able to establish a link between the premise and the hypothesis. However, as it stands, the premise alone does not offer enough information to reach a conclusion about the recycling of the paint. It is important to recognize that there could be alternative explanations for the boy's celebration with paint on his face and clothing. Some potential scenarios could include: 1. The paint is a part of a cultural or religious celebration, where using paint is customary. 2. The boy is participating in an art workshop or a school activity that involves putting paint on faces and clothing as a fun and creative form of expression. 3. The paint could be color powder used in an event like the Color Run, a paintball game, or something similar that is not necessarily related to recycling.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Hundreds of elves helming the command centre of Santa's mile-wide, ultrahigh-tech sleigh, the S-1. for the following movie plot: Set on Christmas Eve, the film opens with hundreds of elves helming the command centre of Santa's mile-wide, ultrahigh-tech sleigh, the S-1. Santa and the elves deliver presents to every children in the world using advanced equipment and military precision. These complex operations are micromanaged by Santa's oldest son Steve and his obsequious elfin assistant Peter (amongst thousands of more elves) at mission control underneath the North Pole, while Steve's clumsy and panophobic younger brother Arthur answers the letters to Santa. During a delivery operation, when a child wakes up and almost sees Santa, an elf back in the S-1 inadvertently presses a button, causing a present to fall off a conveyor and go unnoticed. Having completed his 70th mission, Santa is portrayed as far past his prime and whose role in field operations now is largely symbolic. Nonetheless, he is held in high esteem, and delivers a congratulatory speech to the enraptured elves. Much to Steve's frustration, who has long anticipated succeeding his father, Santa announces he looks forward to his 71st. During their family Christmas dinner, Arthur's suggestion for the family to play a board game degenerates into a petty quarrel between Santa and Steve, while Grand-Santa, bored by retirement, resentfully criticises their over-modernisation. Distraught, the various family members leave the dinner table. When Arthur humbly compliments Steve that he believes he will be a great Santa Claus, Steve rudely dismisses Arthur's overture; later, their father shares with Mrs. Claus his grave doubts about his self-identity should he retire. Meanwhile, an elf named Bryony finds the missed presenta wrapped bicycle that has yet to be deliveredand alerts Steve and his elf-assistant to the problem. Arthur is alarmed when he recognises the present as a gift for Gwen, a little girl to whom he had personally replied. Arthur alerts his father, who is at a loss as to how to handle the situation; Steve argues that one missed present out of billions is an acceptable...

Return your answer on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\". Choose from: [-] 0. [-] 1. [-] 2. [-] 3. [-] 4. [-] 5.","completion":"On the suggested scale, where 0 represents \\"not similar\\" and 5 represents \\"very similar\\", the similarity between these two sentences would be scored as a 1. The two sentences do not convey the same message even though both involve the notion of security threats. A detailed breakdown of the two sentences would help us understand why they aren't the same. The first sentence - \\"Russia said the system is a clear threat to Russian security\\" - is very specific. It indicates that Russia perceives a certain 'system' as posing a clear and direct threat to its own national security. This sentence is subjective in that it provides Russia's perspective of the issue in question. On the other hand, the second sentence - \\"It is a serious threat to international security\\" - is more universal in its focus. It is discussing the 'system' as a serious threat not only to one nation but to global or international security. This sentence is broader and more inclusive, as it implies a threat that has implications for multiple nations and perhaps the global community at large, instead of a specific threat to just one country, Russia, as is the case with the first sentence. Additionally, there is a difference in the severity of the threats described in the two sentences. The first sentence describes the threat as a 'clear' threat while the second sentence takes it a notch higher by describing it as a 'serious' threat. Overall, while there are superficial similarities in the sense that both sentences discuss a 'system' being a threat, the differences in perspective, in the scope of threat, and the severity of the threat make these sentences dissimilar in their meaning. Hence the low score of 1. The presence of a common theme of 'security threat' is the only reason the score is not closer to a '0'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Culture Club are an English band that was formed in 1981. The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. Culture Club sold more than 50 million albums and 100 million singles (including Boy George solo) records worldwide, including 7 million-records awards RIAA certificate in the United States. In 1981, Blitz Club regular Boy George occasionally sang with the group Bow Wow Wow under the stage name Lieutenant Lush. After his tenure with the group ended, George decided to start his own band and enlisted bassist Mikey Craig, drummer Jon Moss, and finally guitarist Roy Hay. Realising they had an Irish gay man as the lead singer, a black Briton on bass, a blond Englishman on guitar and keyboards, and a Jewish drummer, they eventually decided to call themselves Culture Club. The group recorded demos, which were paid for by EMI Records, but the label was unimpressed and decided not to sign the group. Virgin Records heard the demos and signed the group in the UK, releasing their albums in Europe, while Epic Records released their albums in the United States and much of the rest of the world since Virgin did not have a US presence at the time. George began sporting a look inspired by Siouxsie Sioux with \\"heavy make-up and swaggy hair\\". The band released two singles in May and June 1982, \\"White Boy\\" and \\"I'm Afraid of Me\\", though both failed to chart. In August the single \\"Mystery Boy\\" was released in Japan. In September of that year, the group released their third single, \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", a reggae-influenced number, which became one of their biggest hits. The song went to No. 1 in the UK in late 1982 and became an international smash, peaking at No. 1 in over a dozen countries (No. 2 in the US), this track sold up to 6.5 million copies worldwide. The band's 1982 debut on Top of the Pops created tabloid headlines, which focused on George's androgynous style of dress and sexual ambiguity. Magazines began to feature George prominently on their covers. Pete Burns, lead singer of the new wave band Dead or Alive, would later claim he was the first to wear braids, big hats, and colourful costumes, but George would cut back with a sharp-tongued remark, \\"It's not who did it first, it's who did it better.\\" The band's debut album, Kissing to Be Clever (UK No. 5, US No. 14) was released in October 1982, and the follow-up single, \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\", became another Top 10 hit in the US (Number 2) and UK (Number 3). \\"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\\" also became a Top Ten hit in the US (Number 9) and in Canada. This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group since The Beatles to have three Top Ten hits in America from a debut album. Kissing to Be Clever sold over 1.5 million copies in the US, being certified platinum, and sold another 3 million worldwide at the time of its release.

Article: One year, a college in the Unites States announced that it would offer a lot of money for the pure white marigold . The high reward attracted so many people, but in the nature, besides golden, the marigold is brown, and it is not easy to get the white one. So after they were excited for a time, many people had forgotten the announcement. One normal day after 20 years, the college received a letter and 100 seeds of pure white marigold. It turned out to be an old woman of over 70 years old. Some experts in the college doubted it , but in order not to let her down, those seeds finally took root in the earth. The miracle appeared after one year: the field was covered by pure white marigold. Therefore, the old woman who was always unknown to the public became a new _ . The old woman was a flower-lover. When she read the announcement 20 years ago, she got very excited like others. But her right children were totally against her decision. After all, a woman who never knew the seed genetics couldn't complete what the experts could never do, so her thought was only a day dream. Still, the old woman didn't change her mind and went on working. She planted some of the most common seeds and took good care of them. A year later, when the marigold came out, she chose one faintest from those golden and brown flowers and get the best seed. The next year, she again grew them and chose.... Day after day, year after year, through many seasons, the old woman's husband died, her children flew far and high, a lot of things happened in her life, but only the desire to grow the pure white marigold took root in her heart. Finally, after 20 years on the day we all know, in the garden she saw a marigold which was not nearly white, but as white as sliver or snow. A problem even experts couldn't deal with was solved by an old woman who didn't understand genetics. Wasn't it a miracle? To take root in the heart, even the most common seed can grow into a miracle! Question: The passage mainly talks about _ . Answer: A:","completion":"The passage mainly talks about the importance of holding on to dreams. This story highlights the unwavering determination and perseverance of an old woman who, despite not having any expertise in genetics, was able to achieve what experts with knowledge and resources could not - cultivating a pure white marigold. Her strong desire and commitment to her dream drove her to work tirelessly, year after year, against all odds and opposition from her children. As the story unfolds, it demonstrates the power of an individual's dreams and the miracles that can result when one remains steadfast and dedicated. The old woman's love for flowers and her refusal to be deterred by her lack of expertise in the field ultimately led her to achieve the seemingly impossible goal of developing a pure white marigold. This extraordinary accomplishment became a symbol of hope and inspiration to many, showing that even the most common seed can indeed grow into a miracle when rooted in the heart. In conclusion, this passage emphasizes the importance of holding on to dreams, irrespective of one's knowledge or background. It serves as a testament to the resilience and strength of the human spirit, showing that when we believe in ourselves and remain committed to our goals, we can achieve greatness and create a lasting impact on the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject. Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets: Core, Non-core, and Under Review. Core: Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines Non-core: Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS). Enron has approx. 8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns. Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion. An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets. Under Review: EGM, EIM. These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability. Required resource levels are being carefully studied. Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates. Approximately 800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter. These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets. Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of 500MM-1Bn. Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says. Short-term liquidity is provided by the 3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the 1Bn of new debt, and the 1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy. Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity. Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt. McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles: Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets. It was initially capitalized with 950MM of 144a debt and 125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors). The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets. Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation). The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies. The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water. As long as Wessex is worth at least 2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required. If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide 650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt. This 650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances. Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'. It was initially capitalized with 2.4Bn of 144a debt and 220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals). As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) 1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup. Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. 600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity. The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.

Background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

How does the sentence end? See options at the end Emily told Patricia they look like Adriana Lima when they were at the beach because Choose from: (I). Emily was from Brazil.. (II). Patricia was from Brazil..","completion":"When Emily told Patricia they look like Adriana Lima when they were at the beach, it was because Patricia was from Brazil (Option II). Adriana Lima is a famous Brazilian model who has become a symbol of beauty and success in the fashion world. People from Brazil, and around the globe, admire her breathtaking beauty, charm, and achievements, which have placed her among the industry's top models. In this scenario, Emily, who is quite perceptive and knowledgeable about popular culture, recognized that Patricia bears a striking resemblance to Adriana Lima, the world-renowned Brazilian supermodel. This recognition may have come from various aspects of Patricia's appearance, such as her facial features, body structure, or even her demeanor. When they were at the beach, Emily likely observed these similarities, and being the forthcoming person she is, felt the need to let Patricia know that she sees a bit of Adriana Lima in her. Emily's choice to draw this comparison could have also stemmed from a sense of pride in their shared Brazilian nationality and an acknowledgement of the accomplishments of their compatriots. Since Patricia hails from Brazil, she may have displayed a similar sense of pride and affinity to the country's cultural icons. The beach setting, with its relaxed atmosphere and sunny skies, presented the perfect opportunity for such a light-hearted and upbeat exchange of ideas between Emily and Patricia. Additionally, complimenting someone by comparing them to a famous icon like Adriana Lima could boost their self-esteem and make them feel good about themselves. This comparison could have also emphasized the characteristics and qualities that Patricia and Adriana share beyond appearances, such as determination, confidence, and poise. In making this flattering remark, Emily possibly wanted to encourage Patricia to embrace her beauty and individuality while also reminding her of the strong and empowering nature shared by Brazilian women. In conclusion, Emily told Patricia they look like Adriana Lima when they were at the beach due to Patricia's Brazilian background (Option II). This observation highlights the physical resemblances between the two women, celebrates the achievements of a fellow Brazilian, and fosters a sense of pride, confidence, and empowered identity within Patricia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Montevideo: According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of −1.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975–1985, which showed a rate of −5.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Porky's Context: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap.

Perhaps our \\"eh\\" experience was magnified because we arrived at Bomberos right after having dined at Postino for dinner. The huge difference between the quality of service was hard to miss! Our group of 6 was quickly seated, and the hostess was kind enough to turn up the heater to make sure we were warm enough. That was the highlight of the service. Now, the service was definitely not rude... it wasn't inconsiderate... it was just... well... not very good. Our waitress (and apparently the chef) could not tell us the ingredients in any of the desserts. Even though they source their desserts from Tammie Coe, why don't they know what is in them? For people with allergies, this can make or break a meal. Since we couldn't confirm the ingredients, my husband had to make do with a coffee, while I indulged in the Creme Brulee. It was good. Pleasant, but certainly nothing spectacular. The few times our waitress came by to check on our group, she seemed to have strange timing... like she didn't really know how to leave... she just sort of stood there a few seconds too long, until it was slightly awkward. Strange. Then, we wouldn't see her for large stretches of time... we were getting thirsty with no water refills!

Comparison to another location: The review begins by unfavorably comparing the dining experience at Bomberos to a previous dinner at Postino, setting a negative precedent. 2. Quality of Service: The reviewer states that the service was not very good. Though they mention that it wasn't rude or inconsiderate, they express dissatisfaction with the waitress's lack of knowledge regarding the dessert ingredients and her overall service. 3. Food Allergies Concern: The reviewer's concern about the lack of information regarding the ingredients in the desserts can be seen as a negative point, especially for customers with food allergies. 4. Timing and Absence of the Waitress: The awkward timing of the waitress and her unavailability for large stretches are mentioned as negative aspects of the service. 5. Lack of Water Refills: This hints at inadequate service, thereby adding to the negative tone of the review. Although there are some positive comments about the ambiance and the outdoor patio, these are outweighed by the negatives regarding the service.

Jumel, propositioning the then ruler, Mohamed Ali Pasha, that he could earn a substantial income by growing an extra-long staple Maho (Barbadence) cotton, in Lower Egypt, for the French market. Mohamed Ali Pasha accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown in preference to other crops. By the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached 16 million (120,000 bales), which rose to 56 million by 1864, primarily due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market.

At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done.\\" The Rolling Stones album Dirty Work (UK No. 4; US No. 4) was released in March 1986 to mixed reviews, despite the presence of the US top five hit \\"Harlem Shuffle\\". With relations between Richards and Jagger at a low, Jagger refused to tour to promote the album, and instead undertook his own solo tour, which included Rolling Stones songs. Richards has referred to this period in his relations with Jagger as \\"World War III\\". As a result of the animosity within the band at this time, they almost broke up. Jagger's solo records, She's the Boss (UK No. 6; US No. 13) (1985) and Primitive Cool (UK No. 26; US No. 41) (1987), met with moderate success, and in 1988, with the Rolling Stones mostly inactive, Richards released his first solo album, Talk Is Cheap (UK No. 37; US No. 24). It was well-received by fans and critics, going gold in the US. The following year 5x5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones, a documentary spanning the career of the band was released for their 25th anniversary. Richards' autobiography, Life, was released on 26 October 2010. According to a 15 October 2010 article published by the Associated Press, Richards described Jagger as \\"unbearable\\" within the book, noting that their relationship has been strained \\"for decades\\". By 2015, Richards' opinion had softened, while still calling Jagger a \\"snob\\" (providing supporting evidence from Jagger's daughter Georgia Mae), he adds \\"I still love him dearly ... your friends don't have to be perfect.\\" what are some of the disputes they had?","completion":"Some of the disputes between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were like a family squabble.

Context: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Question: What did Meg do after her anger simmered? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The text does not specifically mention what Meg did after her anger simmered. It only mentions the elderly lady's anger simmering and asking the narrator what he would do in a situation like that."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again.

Given the question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Who got a law degree?

Question: What is the final step of the following process: - Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust Answer:","completion":"The final step in the process you provided is a phase of the geological process linked to the phenomena of volcanoes and plate tectonics, and is a part of Earth's rock cycle. The process you're describing is essentially the birth of new land - the formation of new crust upon the Earth's surface following a volcanic eruption. After the previous steps, where magma has risen through cracks in the Earth's crust, caused intense pressure leading to the movement of tectonic plates, and then erupted onto the surface, the next step is cooling and solidification. The erupting magma, expelled as lava, can flow over a large area depending on the viscosity and quantity of the eruption. As this molten rock is exposed to the Earth's relatively cooler atmosphere and environment, it gradually solidifies. This process is sometimes rapid, resulting in the creation of volcanic glass called obsidian, while at other times it's slower, forming various types of igneous rocks like basalt or pumice. This formation of new crust essentially extends the Earth's surface, covering the previous landscape with a new layer of solid rock, creating new mountains, plateaus, or filling in valleys depending on the eruption’s magnitude and the surrounding landscape. This fresh layer can eventually become fertile ground for life, as weathering breaks down the rocks and forms soil, capable of supporting plant life, which over eons of time, through the process of life, death, and decay, can transform the sterile landscape created by the volcanic eruption into a vital ecosystem. As the subsequent eras ensue, this new land will undergo natural processes of weathering, erosion, and plate tectonics, which will in time modify the landscape. It might eventually be buried under sedimentary layers, subjected to the enormous forces and heat at plate boundaries, and potentially be recycled back into the Earth's mantle, where it can melt back into magma, and restart the cycle all over again. So, the final step in the process you've outlined is the solidification and integration of the newly erupted lava into the Earth's crust, leading to the formation of new land landscapes that can support life, contributing to the ever-changing dynamics of the Earth's geological and ecological systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A 'road rage' murder suspect has claimed that he was acting in self-defense when he shot dead a 44-year-old mother last month. Erich Nowsch, 19, was arrested last Friday, a little more than a week after Tammy Meyers was fatally wounded by gunfire that police say came from a silver car that pursued the nurse and her 22-year-old son, Brandon Meyers, to the cul-de-sac outside their Las Vegas home. However Nowsch's lawyers, brothers Conrad Claus and Augustus Claus, said after their client's first court appearance on Monday that they don't believe the case involved road rage. The lawyers plan to review police reports and video evidence before talking more about Nowsch's defense. Scroll down for video. Erich Nowsch Jr. appears in a Las Vegas courtroom for his initial court appearance on Monday in Las Vegas. Nowsch remains jailed following his arrest on Friday on murder, attempted murder and other charges in the February 12 shooting that fatally wounded 44-year-old Tammy Meyers outside her home. Robert Meyers, left, the widower of Tammy Meyers, attends a hearing for his wife's accused killer, Erich Nowsch Jr. in court on Monday. Nowsch's lawyers told ABC that they believe he was acting in self-defense. They later told CNN that Tammy Meyer's son, Brandon, pointed a gun at Nowsch before the shooting began and said that his client had received death threats. However the victim's husband, Robert Meyers, said he thinks his wife realized she was in danger, and was fatally wounded after trying to lure a vehicle and motorist who threatened her away from her home. That's not road rage, that's intentional, Meyers said in an interview after a court appearance by the suspect, his 19-year-old neighbor, Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. 'My wife was followed home and murdered,' Meyers said. Meyers' theory adds yet another dimension to a case already marked by stunning revelations and conflicting accounts from police and the Meyers family. Initially, the family said Tammy Meyers was shot in the head after a confrontation with another motorist while she drove her teenage daughter home from a late-night driving lesson at a neighborhood school. The public was told that Brandon Meyers grabbed his gun and came out of the house, firing back at the fleeing silver car. Last week, family members and police revealed that Tammy Meyers dropped her daughter at home and went back out with her son and the family's green Buick Park Avenue sedan to find the motorist who frightened her earlier. Erich Nowsch Jr appears in a Las Vegas court on Monday. A March 10 preliminary hearing will determine if he should stand trial. What followed was a tire-squealing confrontation with a silver car and gunfire several blocks from the Meyers home. No one was injured. Then, the fatal shooting on the cul-de-sac several houses from the Meyers home. 'I don't know what she saw,' Robert Meyers said on Monday. 'She's dead. I can't ask her. But this was intentional - to kill the person in the green car.' Mr Meyers said that the story of what happened that night has been so confused as all the facts didn't come out immediately. He told ABC: 'My son was very hurt, thinking I was going to blame him for his mom going down, and he didn’t come forward with all the things.' Mr Meyers said his daughter has helped him get a clearer picture of what went on. According to the widower, a suspect, who is still at large, stood in front of the hood of his wife's car and threatened to kill her and his daughter. Mr Meyers added: 'And after that, my daughter said my wife spun out to get away from this guy right on this street. 'My daughter said my wife was going as fast as she could. ... My wife was as great driver. She came from a good stock of drivers.' Las Vegas police aren't commenting about the changing accounts, and aren't addressing whether Tammy Meyers' death resulted from a random road-rage shooting as it first appeared. Captain Christopher Tomaino told the media Friday that police were still looking for an accomplice who was with Nowsch, and questions about the case will eventually be answered. Robert Meyers, 49, was out of state when the shooting happened. He said on Monday his wife and Nowsch knew each other — well enough for the teen to hitch up his saggy shorts when Tammy Meyers approached him in the neighborhood park, so she wouldn't have to tell him to do so. It's not clear if they recognized each other during the shootings. Robert Meyers said Nowsch was probably familiar with the family's Buick, but might not have seen it since the windows were tinted dark last summer. Nowsch is charged with murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle. He did not speak and did not enter a plea when he appeared in a Las Vegas court on Monday. A March 10 preliminary hearing will determine if he should stand trial. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson would then decide whether to seek the death penalty. 'Nothing is off the table,' he told KTNV. Police said Nowsch told friends he was at the park and became alarmed by a vehicle he thought was following him, so he called a friend to pick him up. Las Vegas police say Nowsch bragged to his friends several hours after the shooting that he 'got those kids, they were after me, and I got them'. Nowsch showed his friends a .45-caliber handgun and told them he fired several shots in the first encounter and 22 shots in the cul-de-sac, according to the police report. Robert Meyers and police said Brandon Meyers fired three shots during the second shooting. It wasn't clear if he hit a silver Audi with Nowsch and at least one other person inside, police said. Nowsch (left) is charged with the murder of Tammy Meyers (left and right), attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle last month. Nowsch lived with his single mother and her one-month-old daughter about a block from the Meyers family home. Tammy Meyers served as a mother figure to youngsters about the same age as her children, now 15 to 22 years old, Meyers said, and two Meyers sons attended high school with Nowsch. Meyers said that at least once, Tammy Meyers gave the teen 20 when he said he was hungry. Meyers also recalled Nowsch earning pocket money washing cars outside the Meyers family home. The teen and the neighborhood mom may have seen each other in passing the weekend of February 7-8, when Tammy Meyers walked the family dogs in the park where Nowsch often sat at a picnic bench with other teens, Robert Meyers said.

Markfield was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965 after the publication of \\"To an Early Grave\\". - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\".

During his tenure at Saturday Night Live , he and Chevy Chase created Weekend Update , the longest - running sketch in the show 's history , and one of the longest running sketches on television . - A television set, more commonly called a television, TV, TV set, television receiver, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays. - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television.

It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. - Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series. Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others. - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission.

Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s. - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014). - The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\". \\"The Colbert Report\\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \\"Today\\" and \\"Meet the Press\\". - A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the US, structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\\" on NBC. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. On television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching away from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode. - The Daily Show is an American news satire and late-night talk show television program hosted by Trevor Noah. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, \\"The Daily Show\\" draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well. - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), breaking character occurs when an actor ceases to maintain the illusion that they are identical with the character they are portraying. If the breaking of character is particularly serious, it is considered corpsing, which in film or television would normally result in an abandonment of that take. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay. - In theatre, a monologue (from , from \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks.

Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program that is broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program in U.S. television history, though its current format bears little resemblance to the one it debuted with on November 6, 1947.

Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 highrise commercial buildings covering between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City. Commissioned by the Rockefeller family, it is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan, spanning the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Bye Bye Braverman is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel \\"To an Early Grave\\" by Wallace Markfield. - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh.

The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show. - Screenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is frequently a freelance profession. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. In which person's reaction will the acid and base particles move faster? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. A:","completion":"In this scenario, Justin and Thomas are conducting experiments in their chemistry laboratory course by mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium-based compounds. Given that Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature and Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature, it is important to determine in which person's reaction will the acid and base particles move faster. This can be understood by analyzing the relationship between temperature and the rate of reaction. As the provided hint suggests, when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is generally faster. This is because higher temperatures provide particles of the reactants, in this case, the acid and base particles, with more kinetic energy. This additional kinetic energy allows the particles to move at a faster pace and as a result, they are more likely to collide with one another. Furthermore, when particles have more energy, the collisions that occur have greater force, which increases the likelihood of a successful reaction taking place. Taking the example of food spoilage due to chemical reactions, it is observed that these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures. This is the reason why perishable food items are stored in refrigerators or freezers to slow down the rate of spoilage. By lowering the temperature, we effectively reduce the kinetic energy of the particles involved in the chemical reactions causing spoilage, slowing down the overall rate of the reactions. Applying this principle to the reactions being conducted by Justin and Thomas, it can be deduced that the acid and base particles in Justin's reaction will move faster as he is conducting the reaction at a higher temperature compared to Thomas. Consequently, the increased rate of movement and the likelihood of collisions with greater force will result in a faster reaction in Justin's experiment compared to Thomas'. In conclusion, the acid and base particles in Justin's reaction will move faster due to the higher temperature he is conducting his experiment at, which results in a faster reaction rate compared to Thomas' reaction, which takes place at a lower temperature. This concept of temperature affecting the rate of reaction is observed in various chemical processes, including the spoilage of food, and highlights the importance of understanding and controlling reaction conditions in a laboratory setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It mentions that the person worked hard and achieved their goals. This statement implies that the person accomplished what they set out to do, which would lead to a feeling of satisfaction and completion. The word \\"fulfilled\\" encompasses this concept, as it refers to the state of being satisfied or happy with the result of one's efforts. Here's a brief explanation of why the other choices are not suitable: - Headache: This option relates to physical pain and is not necessarily associated with the achievement of goals. While working hard might lead to physical stress, the overall context of the question highlights the positive outcome of achieving goals, so \\"headache\\" is not the best fit. - Disappointed: This choice suggests a negative outcome, contrary to the mentioned context. Disappointment arises when someone fails to meet their expectations or desired results, which is not the case in this scenario since the individual achieved their goals. - Celebrated: Achieving goals might indeed lead to celebration, but this option refers to an action and not a personal feeling or state of being. Consequently, \\"celebrated\\" doesn't fully capture the emotional aspect of the individual directly resulting from their success. - Simplicity: This choice doesn't strongly relate to the individual's feelings after achieving their goals. Simplicity refers to the quality or condition of being simple, which doesn't encompass the emotional aftermath of accomplishing what one set out to do.

What is the answer?","completion":"The mobile phone company that has the motto \\"Connecting people\\" is Nokia. Nokia Corporation is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Nokia's journey began as a wood pulp mill near the town of Nokia, Finland, and later branched out into electricity generation and rubber production. Over the years, the company transitioned through various industries such as telecommunications cables, televisions, and computer products. However, it wasn't until the advent of mobile communications that Nokia became widely recognized. In the 1980s and 1990s, Nokia cemented its position as one of the dominant forces in the global mobile phone market. The company was known for its reliable and user-friendly devices, as well as its simple, elegant designs. The \\"Connecting people\\" motto was created during this era as part of Nokia's marketing and branding campaign. The slogan and Nokia's famous hands logo aimed to capture the essence of their mission: to use technology to bring people together, enabling them to connect and communicate with ease, no matter where they were in the world. Nokia's mobile phones became immensely popular, and their products—such as the Nokia 3310—are still remembered as iconic devices that shaped the mobile revolution. However, as the smartphone era dawned, Nokia faced challenges from emerging competitors like Apple, Samsung, and other Android-based devices. The company's struggles eventually led to a partnership with Microsoft, and Nokia's mobile phone business was later acquired by Microsoft in 2014. Although Nokia's smartphone efforts encountered various obstacles, the company still has a presence in the telecommunications industry. In recent years, Nokia has primarily focused on providing network solutions, infrastructure, and services for mobile operators, internet service providers, and other large enterprises. Thus, the motto \\"Connecting people\\" still resonates, but in a different context than it did during the days of Nokia's mobile phone dominance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dreamgirls is a 2006 American romantic musical drama film written and directed by Bill Condon and jointly produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures. Adapted from the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name by composer Henry Krieger and lyricist/librettist Tom Eyen, Dreamgirls is a film a clef, a work of fiction taking strong inspiration from the history of the Motown record label and one of its acts, The Supremes. The story follows the history and evolution of American R&B music during the 1960s and 1970s through the eyes of a Detroit, Michigan girl group known as the Dreams and their manipulative record executive. The film adaptation of Dreamgirls stars Jamie Foxx, Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, and also features Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose and Keith Robinson. Dreamgirls premiered on December 4, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, where it received a standing ovation. The film's Los Angeles premiere was held on December 11 at the Wilshire Theater in Beverly Hills. Similar to the releases of older Hollywood musicals such as The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story, Dreamgirls debuted with three special ten-day roadshow engagements beginning on December 15, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles, and the AMC Metreon 15 in San Francisco. Tickets for the reserved seats were 25 each; the premium price included a forty-eight page full-color program and a limited-print lithograph. This release made Dreamgirls the first American feature film to have a roadshow release since Man of La Mancha in 1972. Dreamgirls earned a total of 851,664 from the roadshow engagements, playing to sold-out houses on the weekends. The film's national release, at regular prices, began on December 25. Outside of the U.S., Dreamgirls opened in Australia on January 18, and in the United Kingdom on February 2. Releases in other countries began on various dates between January and early March. Dreamgirls eventually grossed 103 million in North America, and almost 155 million worldwide. DreamWorks Home Entertainment released Dreamgirls to home video on May 1, 2007 in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray formats. The DVD version was issued in two editions: a one-disc standard version and a two-disc \\"Showstopper Edition\\".

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the pediment adorned by reclining saints? This is not to say that Sicily was completely isolated from trends elsewhere in Europe. Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini, who arrived from Florence in 1463. This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches (1531–37), Antonio Gagini completed the proscenium-like arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani. This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has pilasters — not fluted, but decorated heavily with relief busts of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central shield that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Gesù (Illustration 14), constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque. Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II. The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso's Quattro Canti, an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the crossroads of the city's two principal streets. Around this intersection are four open sides, being the streets, and...","completion":"The name of the pediment adorned by reclining saints is the pedimented arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani.

Please answer the following question: At a doctor's office, two women are having their annual physical done. Jessie goes in first and is told that that she should go see a dermatologist about the skin issues she is having. The doctor then sees Martha who is having a pain in her right arm and who also has hypertension. The doctor talks to Martha about her issues and then heads home for the day. Which patient will be more likely to be told to exercise more? Hint: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Martha is more likely to be told to exercise more. This is because she has hypertension, which is a risk factor for developing heart disease, stroke, and other serious cardiovascular diseases. Exercise is one of the suggested treatments for hypertension, along with diet changes and medication.

Article: The deliberate separation of the Luftwaffe from the rest of the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major \\"communications gap\\" between Hitler and the Luftwaffe, which other factors helped to exacerbate. For one thing, Göring's fear of Hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When Göring decided against continuing Wever's original heavy bomber programme in 1937, the Reichsmarschall's own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, not how many engines each had. In July 1939, Göring arranged a display of the Luftwaffe's most advanced equipment at Rechlin, to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case. Question: Who's bombing program did Goring abandon in 1939?","completion":"In 1939, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring abandoned the bombing program initiated by General Walther Wever, who had originally developed a concept for a strategic heavy bomber for the Luftwaffe. General Wever had understood the importance of long-range bombing capability to target the enemies' vital industries and infrastructure. However, Göring decided to discontinue Wever's heavy bomber program in 1937, which eventually had a major impact on the Luftwaffe's strength and capability during World War II. One of the reasons behind Göring's decision was his fear of Hitler, which led him to misrepresent the actual situation and provide an over-optimistic assessment of the German air force's capabilities. Göring aimed to project an image of a strong and well-prepared defense force, even though it was not entirely true. This decision proved to be a significant misstep, as the lack of a proper strategic bombing capability left the Luftwaffe unprepared to face other powerful air forces during the war. The absence of a heavy bomber fleet limited the Luftwaffe's capacity to effectively attack enemy targets and put more pressure on the ground forces. Consequently, this decision negatively impacted the overall German war effort. It is important to note that the separation of the Luftwaffe from the rest of the military structure, along with other factors such as the communication gap between Hitler and the Luftwaffe, greatly contributed to this series of events. This disconnect prevented timely and accurate information from reaching the top leadership and allowed for crucial errors and misjudgments, including Göring's decision to abandon General Walther Wever's strategic heavy bomber program."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"The Cassiopeia constellation is visible year-round from most locations in the Northern Hemisphere. Its visibility varies depending on your location and the time of year, but the best month to observe Cassiopeia usually lies between September and November. To provide a well-rounded understanding, let's evaluate some factors affecting the visibility of this constellation and analyze why these months are ideal for viewing. 1. Sky positioning: Cassiopeia has a noticeable \\"W\\" shape, and is located opposite the Big Dipper in the sky. When the Big Dipper is low on the horizon, Cassiopeia appears high up in the sky, and vice versa. Between September and November, this constellation is situated at a higher position in the sky, making it easier to spot. 2. Darkness: As the fall season approaches, the number of daylight hours decreases, allowing for longer periods of darkness each night. Darker skies are generally better for stargazing since they counteract the effects of light pollution, thereby increasing the likelihood of spotting constellations like Cassiopeia. 3. Weather: In the Northern Hemisphere, September to November typically brings more stable weather with clear skies. Cloudless nights make it easier to observe stars and constellations, offering a better view of celestial objects including Cassiopeia. While meteorological conditions tend to vary in different regions, these months generally see more favorable conditions for stargazing. 4. Moon phase: Observing a constellation is more optimal when the moon isn't full since its light can wash out fainter stars. For the best view of Cassiopeia, consult a lunar calendar and aim to stargaze during a new moon or during the days when the moon is in a crescent phase. Considering these factors, the ideal strategy for observing the Cassiopeia constellation would involve the following steps: 1. Choose a location with minimal light pollution, such as a remote area away from city lights or a designated stargazing spot. 2. Consult a lunar calendar to determine the least-lit nights in terms of moon phases around September to November. 3. Check the local weather forecast for clear, cloudless nights within the chosen timeframe. 4. Locate the Cassiopeia constellation in the sky using the \\"W\\" shape as a guide. A star map, stargazing app, or a planisphere can make it easier to locate constellations. 5. For added enjoyment, consider using a telescope or binoculars for a closer look at the stars within Cassiopeia. Overall, the best month to see the Cassiopeia constellation is subjective, but aiming for September, October, or November generally provides a greater chance of success. By taking into account the sky positioning, darkness, weather, and lunar phases, stargazers can increase their likelihood of observing this beautiful constellation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What was the best episode of Star Trek (The Original Series), and why? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are related but not the same. Question 1 asks for a list of must-see episodes of Star Trek (The Original Series), while Question 2 asks for the best episode of the series and the reason behind its selection. To answer both questions, let's provide information for each of them. Answer to Question 1: There are numerous episodes from Star Trek (The Original Series) that are considered must-see by fans and critics alike. Here are ten classic episodes that showcase the characters, themes, and storylines that define the series. 1. The City on the Edge of Forever (Season 1, Episode 28): When a delirious Dr. McCoy accidentally travels back in time, Kirk and Spock must follow him to prevent a timeline-altering catastrophe. 2.

Answer to Question 2: While opinions can vary, one of the most celebrated episodes of Star Trek (The Original Series) is \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\". This episode is considered the best for several reasons: 1. Engaging Story: The narrative, written by renowned science fiction author Harlan Ellison, involves time travel, alternate realities, and the moral dilemmas that arise from changing the past. 2. Character Development: The episode presents a complicated relationship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, deepening the viewers' understanding of the series' main characters. 3.

The answer is:","completion":"Based on the information given, this is about Lieutenant General Stephen W. Wilson. Stephen W. Wilson is a highly decorated officer in the United States military, specifically in the U.S. Air Force ('branch is USA'). He was born on May 18, 2015, which is an irregularity as it appears as though this birth date might be a typing mistake - a Lieutenant General usually has a career that spans several decades. Since it's stated that his service years are from 1981 to present, he should have been born well before 2015. He is a Lieutenant General in rank, a high-ranking military position that is below General and above Major General. The initial 'lt gen' in the caption also affirms this rank. The image of him is referred as 'lt gen stephen w. wilson.jpg', reaffirming the identity. Lieutenant General Wilson's allegiance is to the United States of America, evident from the detail given. Over his ongoing service time since 1981, Wilson has commanded at different capacities, including the 14th Flying Training Wing, the 608th Air Operations Force Group, Global Strike Command, Eighth Air Force, and the Air Air Expeditionary Wing, capped by his present position as the commander of AFGSC (Air Force Global Strike Command). In recognition of his distinguished service, Wilson has received numerous awards, including two Air Legion of Merit, two Bronze Stars, a Distinguished Service Medal, and a Defense Superior Service Medal, showcasing a highly decorated military career. The detail 'placeofburial label is place of burial' is quite generic and does not provide specifics, which is understandable in this context, considering Wilson appears to still be alive ('service years from 1981 to the present'). In military records, a place of burial is typically listed for deceased personnel. In conclusion, these details are about Lieutenant General Stephen W. Wilson from the U.S Air Force, notwithstanding the discrepancy in his birth date. His long and ongoing service in various capacities, coupled with his decorated career, are significant indicators of his commitment and contribution to the U.S military."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use evidence from the fact that a cycle happens repeatedly to answer this question: \\"There are 5 steps in the water cycle, it starts with evaporation, ends with infiltration, and then\\"","completion":"The water cycle is a continuous and dynamic process that plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's climate and sustaining life. It consists of five main steps which, after completing the cycle, start again from step one. These steps are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, runoff, and infiltration. This question already mentioned evaporation and infiltration. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the water cycle, I'll discuss the process and evidence of the entire cycle. 1. Evaporation: The cycle begins with the process of evaporation, which occurs when the sun's energy heats up surface water from rivers, lakes, oceans, and other sources. This causes the water molecules to gain energy and transform into water vapor, which then rises into the atmosphere. The evidence for evaporation lies in the fact that water levels in different water bodies regularly fluctuate in response to varying temperatures. 2. Condensation: As the water vapor ascends into the atmosphere, it encounters cooler temperatures, causing the vapor to condense into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. These water droplets or ice crystals coalesce around dust particles in the atmosphere, forming clouds. The evidence for condensation is visible in the formation of clouds in the sky, which vary in shape, size, and density according to atmospheric conditions and the amount of moisture present. 3. Precipitation: When clouds become saturated, or when the air cannot hold any more water vapor, the water droplets or ice crystals become too heavy and fall back to the Earth's surface in the form of precipitation. This can include rain, snow, sleet, or hail. The evidence for precipitation is observable in the variety of weather conditions experienced across the globe, from heavy rainfall in tropical regions to snowfall in colder climates. 4. Runoff: Once precipitation reaches the ground, it travels across land surfaces as runoff, forming streams, rivers, and eventually flowing into lakes, reservoirs, or oceans. The evidence for runoff can be observed in the numerous bodies of flowing water seen on Earth as well as in the way that rainfall often causes rivers, streams, and even streets to swell and flood in urban areas. 5. Infiltration: The final step of the water cycle, infiltration, occurs when a portion of the water from precipitation seeps into the ground and replenishes underground water sources like aquifers. This process can take different amounts of time, ranging from days to thousands of years. The evidence for infiltration can be found in the presence of groundwater sources like wells and underground reservoirs that supply water for human use, agriculture, and ecosystems. Once infiltration occurs, the cycle starts again with evaporation, making the water cycle a continuous and self-sustaining process. The continuous and dynamic nature of the water cycle is essential for maintaining the Earth's water resources, ecosystems, and climate stability. It not only ensures the continuous distribution of water from the surface to the atmosphere and back, but also plays a vital role in regulating global temperatures, sustaining plant and animal life, and influencing weather patterns. The evidence for the water cycle can be observed in the numerous natural and human-made water bodies, weather conditions, and water sources that exist on our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Focus on a newspaper says that a German blood substitute failed. During night, the desolate city is shown to be alive and booming. This is the world of the vampires.On a television two vampires are debating the current situation which has enveloped their society: a shortage of blood. A vagrant vampire snarls at a wealthy one and is quickly subdued by the police.Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) drives to work at Bromley Marks Corp. He looks at his reflection in the mirror, but it isnt there. He goes to a train station and waits for train. Underneath, two feral vampires, sub-siders, are fighting. They are winged monsters with no trace of human characteristics. Edward goes to work. He walks into a lab where humans are chained to harvesters for blood extraction. At a personnel meeting, a death sentenced prisoner was deprived of blood and the corporation knows that with the large blood shortage sub-siders will become more common. Since only 5% of the human population survived the outbreak to become vampires, Edward realizes that the corporation he works for has actively discovered what will be the extinction of the human race in its recognizable form. Charles Bromley (Sam Neill) listens intently and then calls Edward to meet in private.Charles and Edward have blood coffee in private. Charles tells Edward that in 2008 he contracted cancer and was then forced to tell his daughter, Alison, that he was dying. She was devastated and Charles prayed for a miracle. He then became a vampire and immortal and was happy. But Alison saw vampirism as a disease and she ran from Charles, rejecting the life of vampirism.

It's time for testing on vampires. Unfortunately, the situation... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Daybreakers, Edward Dalton (played by Ethan Hawke) resents his brother Frankie Dalton (played by Michael Dorman), for a few reasons. Firstly, their differing opinions on vampirism and humanity create tension between them. Edward, a hematologist, is working on finding a blood substitute in order to save the human race and prevent the extinction of humans, while Frankie works in the vampire military by hunting down and capturing humans to be harvested for blood. Edward views vampirism as a curse and tries to maintain his humanity despite being turned into a vampire, whereas Frankie embraces the vampire lifestyle wholeheartedly and shows no qualms about the exploitation and near-extinction of humans. Additionally, Edward's resentment towards Frankie is rooted in the fact that it was Frankie who turned him into a vampire against his will, robbing him of his humanity. Edward struggles with the moral implications of being a vampire and feeding on human blood, while Frankie does not seem to share these concerns. Furthermore, the brothers' relationship is strained by their differing levels of loyalty to the vampire society and the corporation they work for. While Frankie is loyal to the corporate and societal structure, Edward is more of a rebel, working towards finding a solution to end the domination of vampires over humans and restore balance. This contrast in their priorities and actions creates tension between the two, leading to Edward's resentment towards his brother. In summary, the reasons for Edward resented his brother Frankie in the movie Daybreakers include their opposing views on vampirism and humanity, the fact that Frankie turned Edward into a vampire without his consent, and their differing loyalties and actions concerning the vampire society and the survival of the human race."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was a central figure in the development of rockabilly?

In \\"That's All Right\\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, \\"a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\\" While Katherine Charlton likewise calls Presley \\"rockabilly's originator\\", Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that \\"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly.\\" and, according to Michael Campbell, \\"Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit.\\" In Moore's view, too, \\"It had been there for quite a while, really.

Nadal and the tournament announced his decision simultaneously, exactly one week before the year's last Grand Slam tournament begins. The 28-year-old Spaniard was hurt July 29 while practicing on his home island of Mallorca ahead of the North American hard-court circuit. The next day, Nadal said he had been told by doctors to wear a cast on his wrist for two to three weeks, and would have to sit out U.S. Open tuneup tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati. Nadal also said at that time he expected to be able to return for the U.S. Open itself. But on Monday, he issued a statement on his Facebook page, saying he is \\"very sorry to announce\\" he would not play in New York. \\"I am sure you understand that it is a very tough moment for me since it is a tournament I love and where I have great memories from fans, the night matches, so many things,\\" Nadal's posting read. \\"Not much more I can do right now, other than accept the situation and, as always in my case, work hard in order to be able to compete at the highest level once I am back.\\" The second-ranked Nadal plays left-handed, but he uses a two-handed backhand. The other U.S. Open men's singles champions who did not return to the field the following year were Ken Rosewall in 1971, Pete Sampras in 2003, and Juan Martin del Potro in 2010. Nadal won his second championship at Flushing Meadows in 2013, part of a run of reaching the final in each of his last three appearances in the U.S. Open. He beat Novak Djokovic to win the titles in 2010 and last year, and lost to Djokovic in 2011. But now Nadal will be skipping the tournament for the second time in three years. He did not enter the U.S. Open in 2012, part of an extended absence because of a problem with his left knee. This will be the second time Nadal failed to try to defend a Grand Slam title: A year after winning Wimbledon in 2008, he chose to not enter that tournament, citing knee tendinitis. Nadal is 44-8 with four titles in 2014, including his record ninth French Open trophy. He hasn't competed since losing in the fourth round of Wimbledon to 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios in four sets on July 1. Nadal's 14 major titles are tied with Sampras for the second most in the history of men's tennis, trailing only Roger Federer's record of 17. With Nadal out, five-time U.S. Open champion Federer - now 33, but coming off a runner-up finish at Wimbledon last month and a hard-court title in Cincinnati on Sunday - will join the No. 1-ranked Djokovic as a favorite in Flushing Meadows.

Tina Turner and Lukas Rossi were not raised in the Southeastern United States. Tina Turner, whose real name is Anna Mae Bullock, was born on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee. Tennessee is indeed located in the Southeastern United States. Tina Turner rose to fame in the 1960s, partnering with her then-husband Ike Turner before embarking on a successful solo career following their divorce. She is best known for her powerful voice, energetic performances, and hit songs like \\"Proud Mary,\\" \\"What's Love Got to Do with It,\\" and \\"Private Dancer.\\" Throughout her career, she also appeared in movies and inspired Broadway shows. Although born in the Southeastern United States, Tina Turner later became a Swiss citizen and now resides in Switzerland. On the other hand, Lukas Rossi, a Canadian singer, musician, and songwriter, was born on December 21, 1976, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He gained fame as the lead vocalist of the band Rock Star Supernova, created through the reality television show, Rock Star: Supernova, which aired in 2006. Lukas Rossi has also been part of other music projects and bands, such as Cleavage, Stars Down, and Switchblade Glory. Unlike Tina Turner, Lukas Rossi was not raised in the Southeastern United States, but rather in Canada. In conclusion, while Tina Turner was indeed raised in the Southeastern United States, specifically in Tennessee, Lukas Rossi comes from a completely different background, having been raised in Canada. Therefore, the statement that both these artists were raised in the Southeastern United States is incorrect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information: - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - \`\` Tell Me Why '' is a song by English rock band the Beatles from their album A Hard Day 's Night . In North America , it was released on both the American version of A Hard Day 's Night and the album Something New . Credited to Lennon -- McCartney , it was written by John Lennon in either Paris or New York and recorded in eight takes on 27 February 1964 . - Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene. - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France. - The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the Western world between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With fellow member Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country.

Engineers from McLaren and Ferrari are used to going head-to-head on the Formula One race track in order to give drivers the best chance of taking poll position. But the two racing thoroughbreds are now competing in bobsleigh and skeleton events at the Winter Olympics too as they have both built cutting-edge equipment for athletes representing their home countries – Great Britain and Italy. McLaren Applied Technologies applied the same technologies used in the F1 world to improve the aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity of the sleighs, which will give the British team a competitive edge at the Games. Aerodynamic: McLaren Applied Technologies applied the same technologies used in the F1 world to improve the aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity of the sleighs, which will give the British team a competitive edge at the Games. Here, Lamin Deen pilots a sled in a practice run. The Team GB bobsleigh consists of a main hull, a frame, a front and rear axle and two sets of runners. The hull, also known as a cowling, is constructed of fibreglass and made of two separate sections. The hull is mounted on four runners that each must be made of a single solid piece of steel. No plating or coating is allowed and it is not permitted to warm up runners or use any substance that improves sliding. At the start of the race, the temperature difference between the runners and the reference runner, which is exposed to the open air for one hour before the start of the competition, must be no greater than plus or minus four degrees Celsius. A bob may have a cowled front end but must be open at the rear. Push bars protrude from the hull at the start of a race. Those for the second and third man in the four man event must be retractable. Each bobsleigh has a brake that can only be applied at the finish. Braking during the race means automatic disqualification. Dr Caroline Hargrove, Director of Performance at McLaren Applied Technologies, which is based in Woking, Surrey, told MailOnline that the building of the sleds is about making sure they are designed and made as well as possible to achieve little gains rather than a revolutionary new design. This is because the rules governing which materials are used and the components of the sled are strictly controlled by the Winter Olympics body and any incremental improvements are top secret. ‘In essence we have made both sleds work better and have made them more adaptable - rather than necessarily having radically altered the shape or design of particular components,’ Dr Hargrove said. The company has been involved in the. design of the equipment from the Canadian Olympics and has gathered vast. amounts of data as well as helping the athletes have input into the. design so they can use it easily. The Team GB bobsleigh consists of a main hull, a frame, a front and rear axle and two sets of runners. It has to be made to suit strict rules and key principles to make a good sled (pictured) are applied by engineers. The pressure is on for the sleds to perform well as this year’s British team contains FIBT Skeleton World Cup leader Lizzy Yarnold, who topped the standings in both runs of the Women's Skeleton heats yesterday. Unlike in Formula One, skeleton sleds and bobsleighs need to be heavy so that they gain speed downhill, but at the same time they must also be light enough for athletes to manoeuvre. There is a sweet spot that leads to optimal performance that also complies with strict regulations. ‘Ferrari have built the bobsleigh for the. Italian team so, as you expect, this has given the team at McLaren an. added incentive to produce the goods for Team GB,’ a spokesman for the. company said. Fanboys: Teams of engineers used a wind tunnel (pictured) and computational fluid dynamics tools to reduce the drag of sleds and hone their aerodynamic bodies, which are made largely of carbon fibre and steel. Lizzy Yarnold (pictured) was the fastest in the field during the heats of the Women's Skeleton on day six of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. McLaren said that Team GB athletes are the only ones to use a sled that is completely tailor made for them. Before, they used one size of sled for men and women. To engineer the perfect sleds, experts at McLaren first collected lots of data by fitting test sleds with a range of sensors to understand their strengths and weaknesses - essentially looking at how to make them go faster. Engineers analysed handling data, as handling directly influences speed and looked at unwanted vibrations that hamper good contact between the ice and the sled. They then worked to tweak the designs of the bobsleighs and skeleton bob to tailor them to athletes and enhance their performance. This process included an evaluation of all aspects of design - ranging from materials to aerodynamics - using simulators to identify changes that could make all the difference when it comes to setting a fast time. Data capture: McLaren has been involved in the design of the sleds (pictured) since the Canadian Olympics and has gathered vast amounts of data as well as helping the athletes have input into the designs. Data: McLaren fitted test sleds with a range of sensors, enabling engineers to understand how to make them go faster. Design: The company enhanced the standard design of the sleds to make performance improvements tailored to each athlete. They looked at the materials used, aerodynamics and handling capabilities using computational fluid dynamics and a massive wind tunnel. Set-up: Engineers built adaptability into the designs for the sleds, enabling them to be configured specifically to suit athletes and tracks, rather than relying on a standardised design. Manufacturing: the sleds are hand built and the company has used suppliers it also uses to build its F1 cars. It managed the assembly of sled components with attention to detail not seen before by Team GB. Training: McLaren worked with athletes and coaches to help them learn how to maintain the sleds and understand how to make the best of technological improvements. The company has sent two engineers to the games to iron out any technical glitches. Dr Hargrove said: ‘For the bobsleigh, we wanted to optimise the speed and manoeuvrability of the sled so that athletes can get a better line and therefore go faster. ‘To do this we made computer models and fed in lots of data. We then ran cycles, in the same way that we do for Formula One, to find tiny improvements – and when we did, created parts to test.’ Teams of engineers used a wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamics tools to reduce the drag of sleds and hone their aerodynamic bodies, which are made largely of carbon fibre and steel. The Formula One company managed the manufacturing and assembly of sled components, helping to bring F1 techniques and attention to detail to the sports, which have in the past used old equipment. ‘In the skeleton, we are the only country with a completely adjustable approach. Before there was just one size of sled for men and women, which was not ideal,’ Dr Hargrove said. ‘Every component of the GB sled is adjustable compared to other countries we have real attention to detail. The quality of manufacturing is also really important.’ Each sled is hand built in comparison to the Team GB’s previous sleds, which McLaren described as 'pretty poor’. Dr Hargrove said: ‘The team used to buy second hand sleds and by the time they were modified by different people – some good and some poor – over time, they were less effective. If we only made the sled well, it would have already been much better.’ Cool runnings: McLaren thinks that Team GB is 'definitely' capable of bagging a gold medal in Skeleton and that they have 'a good chance' in bobsleigh. The Sochi run is illustrated, which usually has three uphill sections to slow the sleds down. Going for gold: To engineer the perfect sleds, McLaren first collected lots of data by fitting test sleds with a range of sensors to understand their strengths and weaknesses - essentially looking at how to make them go faster at the Winter Olympics. Lizzy Yarnold is pictured on a run during the Women's Skeleton heats. McLaren managed the manufacturing and assembly of sled components at its factory (pictured) helping to bring F1 techniques and attention to detail to bobsleigh and skeleton, where old equipment has been used in competitions in the past. ‘The design is very strictly governed by the rules and all teams use the same components. In that way it’s similar to Formula One as the FIA and F1 governing body dictate closely what we can do and we try to make incremental gains,’ she added. One of the key ways to make a sled quicker is to improve the way that it takes corners and it is where fractions of seconds can be won and lost. McLaren has worked with athletes in training to figure out how to maximise the impact of technological improvements made to the sleds. Dr Hargrove said: ‘We spend a lot of time at the beginning of the cycles getting athlete feedback and with the alteration of any important detail. Some tweaks might mean a slight change in control, but once athletes learn to adapt they will go faster and we can show them this using a simulator.’ Factory fresh: McLaren has worked with athletes in training to figure out how to maximise the impact of technological improvements made to the sleds at its Surrey-based factory (pictured) Built to last: Each sled (pictured) is hand built in comparison to the Team GB's previous sleds, which McLaren described as 'pretty poor'. Here, Britain's two-man bobsleigh pilot Lamin Deen (front), uses a new sled during a training session at the Games. The company uses simulations so that athletes can train in virtual environments when they are not anywhere near an icy run – which is quite often in the UK. Videos of tracks can be used to gather data and athletes are involved at different stages of changes to their sled’s performance. Dr Hargrove said the competition is a little like Formula One on ice, ‘but the outcome is hugely dependent on the athletes – even more so than in Formula One. In the Olympics, the athletes are at the centre of it all as we hope we’ve helped them as much as we can.’ She thinks the Team GB is ‘definitely’ capable of bagging a gold medal in Skeleton and that the athletes have ‘a good chance’ in bobsleigh. The company uses simulations so that athletes can train in virtual environments before taking to a real ice run.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded. Why Patch's tail felt stiffen? - The scent of a squirrel he didn't recognize. - not enough information - Uneasiness. - The winter wind. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Patch's tail stiffened because he sensed an unfamiliar and musky scent in Silver's drey, which belonged to a squirrel he didn't recognize. This unfamiliar scent made him uneasy and alerted him to the possibility of danger, as it was not normal for a squirrel to abandon their drey for days, especially during winter. The combination of Silver's disappearance, the strange scent, and the winter circumstances contributed to the uneasiness Patch experienced, making his tail stiffen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.” Sacred...

Please answer the following question: Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts. The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

Input: Background Paragraph: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.

Would \\"The Chernobyl disaster is widely considered to have been the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011).\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"The Chernobyl disaster, which occurred on April 26, 1986, at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near the city of Pripyat, in the north of the Ukrainian SSR, is indeed widely considered to have been the worst nuclear power plant accident in history and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011). However, this information does not directly address the distance of evacuation from the Russian nuclear meltdown. Upon discovery of the Chernobyl explosion, the immediate area surrounding the power plant, including the city of Pripyat, was evacuated. The radius of the initial evacuation zone was 10 kilometers (about 6.2 miles) and was later expanded to cover a 30-kilometer (approximately 18.6 miles) exclusion zone. This area is generally referred to as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, which as of today, remains largely uninhabited due to the dangerously high levels of radiation still present. On the day of the disaster, entire towns and settlements were given a short notice to evacuate, which led to a chaotic and disorganized response. An estimated 49,000 residents of Pripyat were evacuated within a span of 3.5 hours, and in the subsequent days and weeks, an estimated 135,000 people were permanently relocated from their homes within a 30-kilometer radius of the power plant. The Chernobyl disaster had a profound impact not just on the environment and the individuals who were directly affected. It also led to significant changes in the design, safety, regulation, and inspection of nuclear power plants around the world. In addition, it served as a critical moment in addressing the environmental and human costs of nuclear power generation and evaluating the risks associated with its use as an energy source. In summary, to answer the question about the distance of evacuation from the Russian nuclear meltdown, it would not be reasonable to respond with the statement given. Instead, it is more relevant to mention the 10-kilometer initial evacuation radius, the eventual 30-kilometer exclusion zone, and the estimated 135,000 people who were permanently displaced due to the Chernobyl disaster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that agreed the Blur was an \\"anti-grunge band'? ? Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, emerged in part as a reaction against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by \\"youthful exuberance and desire for recognition\\". The leading Britpop bands, \\"Blur and Oasis[,] exist[ed] as reactionary forces to [grunge's] eternal downcast glare.\\" Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, \\"Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness.\\"Britpop artists were vocal about their disdain for grunge. In a 1993 NME interview, Damon Albarn of Britpop band Blur agreed with interviewer John Harris' assertion that Blur was an \\"anti-grunge band\\", and said, \\"Well, that's good.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

A voicemail message in which John Edwards's mistress makes fun of her lover's cancer-stricken wife has been released as the former Democratic politician stands trial accused of using campaign money to hide his affair in 2008. Rielle Hunter, who was pregnant with Edwards's child as he vied to become Barack Obama's running mate, left the message for his aide Andrew Young as she watched the then Senator on television. She can be heard laughing down the phone as she points out the awkward body language between Edwards and his wife - who had terminal cancer. 'The have footage of it on ABC News. World News Tonight, Obama leaving the house shaking his hand, um, and. Elizabeth, and, and, Johnny and Elizabeth couldn't be further apart from. each other (laughter),' she says. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. 'They're so far apart': Rielle Hunter left a voicemail for Edwards aide Andrew Young laughing at this news video which shows John Edwards (right) and his wife Elizabeth (left) standing apart from one another. Running mates? The clip showed then-candidate Barack Obama leaving a private meeting at the home of John Edwards, seen shaking hands here. Close: Mr Obama and Edwards hugged goodbye as many speculated that Edwards wanted to be his vice president. 'I mean, on either side, like of the driveway. So, so, yea, interesting,' she continued. The video that Hunter was referring to, shown above, was captured from a helicopter who spotted Mr Obama, who was the front-runner in the Democratic race, making a private visit to the Edwards' North Carolina home after a meeting with the Senator. In the short clip, it shows Mr Obama leaving their house, shaking Edwards' hand and giving him a hug before riding off in his black SUV. Once Mr Obama leaves, Edwards and Elizabeth walk back into the home standing several feet apart from one another. Then and now: Rielle Hunter appeared on Extra in 2008 (left) and was seen more recently with her daughter Quinn (right) who she had with John Edwards. The voicemail messages come on day four of the Democrat's corruption trial and was one of about 13 between Edwards, Young, and Hunter that the prosecution put into the record of evidence. A number of the other voicemails consist of Edwards calling Young and 'checking in'. At the time, Young and his family were travelling with the pregnant Hunter, after Young initially claimed the paternity in order to keep the heat off of Edwards. In several of the messages, Edwards makes mention of his wife being in his presence, effectively stifling what he really wants to say. The prosecution also put pictures of the expensive hotels where the Youngs and Hunter stayed during this trip, allegedly on the campaign's dime. John Edwards' defense lawyer on Thursday picked apart ex-aide Andrew Young's story that he was asked to conceal Edwards' affair with a mistress with campaign money, accusing him of making up stories about the former presidential contender to make money off of the scandal. Letter from donor: This handwritten note from 'Bunny' Mellon shows her lamenting over the fact that the press skewered Edwards' 400 haircuts, and she said that she would take care of bills. Payments: Ms Mellon would write that her donations were for expensive furniture, like the Table this 10,000 check was for, rather than the alleged payments to hide Hunter. Andrew Young took the witness stand for a fourth straight day at Edwards' campaign finance fraud trial. The star prosecution witness is key to the government's case that while campaigning for the White House in 2008, Edwards directed a scheme to use nearly 1million in secret payments from two wealthy donors to conceal an affair with his pregnant mistress. Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts and faces up to 30 years behind bars if convicted. The defence argued in opening statements that Young spent most of the money at issue in the case to build a 1.5million house for his family, not to buy the silence of Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter. The defence sought to undermine Young's credibility and paint him as a pathological liar. Defence. lawyer Abbe Lowell pointed out inconsistencies with Young's account of. the scandal at trial this week and in multiple other accounts, including. grand jury testimony and his 2010 tell-all book about Edwards. Repeatedly,. Lowell accused Young of lying. Referring to the timing of a. conversation with a law partner of Edwards, Lowell asked, ‘And you made. that up too, didn't you?’ Conflicting stories: John Edwards (left) and his former aide Andrew Young (left) are detailing the 2008 affair. Troubles: Andrew Young told the court yesterday that John Edwards described life with Elizabeth as a 'living hell' after she found out about the affair. December 14, 2007John Edwards to Andrew Young'Uh, if that's, if I'm calling saying what happened, how did this happen, what's goin' on, then that's because Elizabeth's standing there with me. 'Cause I have to, I think I've gotta tell her about this because it's moving.' December 27John Edwards to Andrew Young'I'm just checkin' in with you and, and makin' sure you're safe and, and in a place where you're good and you can just call me back. January 8, 2008John Edwards to Andrew Young'Uh, just wanted for all of you, including her, to know that I am thinking about you.' January 10, 2008Fred Baron to Andrew Young'(Edwards) wants you to know that he's not taking your call or her call right now because of, uh, his circumstances with, uh, the EE, and not to take it personally, but it'll get better soon. But right now he's in a bad place. So, don't get your feelings hurt if your calls are not being returned or her calls are not being returned.' February 17, 2008 Rielle Hunter to Andrew Young 'They have footage of it on ABC News World News tonight, Obama leaving the house shaking his hand, um, and Elizabeth, and, and, Johnny and Elizabeth couldn't be further apart from each other (laughter). I mean, on either side, like of the driveway. So, so, yea, interesting.' ‘No, sir,’ Young responded. Lowell asked Young whether he first learned Hunter, was pregnant in May 2007, as his book says: in June 2007, as he testified; or in early July, a date backed by phone records and Hunter's medical records. The timeline issues could challenge the accounts of conversations Young said he had with Edwards in a car discussing who to ask for money to help take care of Hunter and discussing Hunter's pregnancy. Young said he couldn't recall the exact date for either event. Lowell also challenged Young on which amount of secret money a wealthy heiress said she would provide to help make Edwards president - 1.2million, as he testified this week, or 900,000 and 925,000, figures he had previously given. Young said the number he provided this week is the correct one. Young. had falsely claimed paternity of Edwards' daughter, Frances Quinn. Hunter, while Edwards was campaigning for president. Edwards. acknowledged he had fathered the child two years later. As. Lowell's detailed questioning continued, some jurors appeared. distracted and even U.S. District Court Judge Catherine C. Eagles grew. impatient. ‘I'm not quite. following,’ the judge told Lowell after he asked Young a question about. whose idea it was for Young to claim paternity of Hunter's child. ‘We're. about to beat a dead horse here.’ She warned the attorney she might cut off his questions if they weren't relevant to the criminal charges facing Edwards. ‘You're going to get to the money, right?’ she asked Lowell. Young was expected to remain on the stand throughout all of Thursday. His wife, Cheri Young, could take the stand on Friday. WATCH THE VIDEO.

Article: Today, home-ownership has reached extremely high levels. Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent. However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine? Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores. Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives. Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown. Most analysts accept that at heart it was the housing market--obsessive pursuit of homes, the engendered mortgage lending and an unavoidable house-price crash--that sank the Western world. Germany, say, with its more efficient rental market, had a far smoother ride through trouble. As for the monetary system, in the past few decades, in the hope of getting untaxed capital gains way above their true labour earnings, many people threw their spare cash into buying larger houses or building extra bedrooms. TV programmes about how to make easy money, beautiful rising house prices, and most importantly, our falulty tax system encouraged that. When at some point market broke down, everyone suffered. Our countries ought, instead, to design tax systems that... Question: The cases of Switzerland and Spain prove that _ .

Switzerland has a low home-ownership rate with a thriving economy, high happiness and mental-health scores, and low unemployment.

While we will honor current commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to use the spot agreement to buy any more gas. The reason that this is happening is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now. We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of agreement most gas suppliers are familiar. We have the ordinance approved by the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep us operating. I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are doing. The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth&#x27;s crust - Magma rises - Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano - Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill - Gain energy for eruption - Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes) - If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases - Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense - If the magma is thin and runs Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process, where magma is thin and runs, typically results in a non-explosive, effusive volcanic eruption. In this type of eruption, the magma is transformed into lava and it flows out of the volcano's vent or fissure onto the Earth's surface. Effusive eruptions occur because the viscosity (consistency) of the magma is low and the gas content is relatively low as well. The low viscosity enables the magma to flow easily, allowing gases to escape smoothly without causing violent, explosive eruptions. Instead, the lava steadily seeps out of the volcano and flows downhill, following the paths of least resistance. When the thin, runny magma reaches the Earth's surface, it is called lava. The lava continues to flow out of the volcanic vent, forming various structures depending on its composition and cooling process. The landscapes created by such lava flows can include lava domes, lava fields, lava tubes, and long, snake-like ridges called lava flows. As the lava cools on the surface, it solidifies and forms a rock. Depending on its composition, cooling rate, and other factors, various types of igneous rocks can be formed during this process. Examples of rocks formed by effusive volcanic eruptions are basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. The rates of cooling and thickness of the lava flows can impact the rock formation, creating different textures and appearances in the volcanic rock. Over time, effusive eruptions can contribute to the growth and development of the volcanic landscape, potentially impacting both ecosystems and human settlements nearby. Typical examples of such non-explosive volcanoes include the Hawaiian volcanoes and Iceland's volcanoes. In conclusion, the final step of the process when magma is thin and runs is a non-explosive, effusive volcanic eruption that results in lava flow and the formation of igneous rocks upon cooling and solidification on the Earth's surface, as well as effectuating changes to the landscape over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"He laughed and said that he had over a hundred patients with failing hearts in the hospital awaiting surgery.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"At least one hundred people are in the hospital waiting for heart surgeries.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise provided, \\"He laughed and said that he had over a hundred patients with failing hearts in the hospital awaiting surgery.\\", we can analyze and conclude the truth value of the hypothesis, \\"At least one hundred people are in the hospital waiting for heart surgeries.\\" Let's break down the critical elements in the premise and examine their significance. 1. \\"He had over a hundred patients\\": This statement informs us that the number of patients mentioned is greater than one hundred. It does not specify an exact number but provides a lower bound on the number of cases. 2. \\"with failing hearts\\": This phrase limits the scope of the patients being discussed to those experiencing heart issues. We can assume these patients are experiencing life-threatening or debilitating cardiac issues that require medical interventions. 3. \\"in the hospital awaiting surgery\\": This statement addresses the location and current status of these patients. They are in the hospital, awaiting a surgical procedure. From the premise provided, we can conclude that someone, likely a medical professional (from the context), claims to have more than one hundred patients dealing with heart issues in the hospital, waiting for surgery. Now, let's consider the hypothesis: \\"At least one hundred people are in the hospital waiting for heart surgeries.\\" The hypothesis supports the idea that there is a minimum of one hundred individuals in the hospital awaiting heart surgeries. Given the premise mentioned above, we can safely conclude that this hypothesis is valid and true. The statement from the medical professional in the premise confirms that there are \\"over a hundred patients\\" experiencing heart issues and awaiting surgery. This quantity is greater than one hundred, which directly verifies the hypothesis statement that \\"at least one hundred people\\" are in that situation. In summary, based on the premise, \\"He laughed and said that he had over a hundred patients with failing hearts in the hospital awaiting surgery.\\", we can conclude that the hypothesis, \\"At least one hundred people are in the hospital waiting for heart surgeries.\\" is true as the premise supports and verifies the hypothesized quantity of patients in the hospital needing heart surgeries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English","completion":"It is essential for risk management planning to become an integral part of the culture of organizations. Risk management is a crucial aspect of running a successful organization, regardless of its size or the industry it operates in. Ensuring that risk management planning becomes an integral part of organizational culture is vital for several reasons: 1. Proactive identification and mitigation of risks: When risk management is embraced as part of the organizational culture, it enables stakeholders to identify potential risks before they turn into significant problems. This proactive approach allows organizations to address these issues timely, thereby avoiding negative consequences that can affect their performance, reputation, and financial stability. 2. Improved decision-making processes: Understanding the risks associated with various decisions and taking steps to mitigate them can significantly improve overall decision-making processes. By integrating risk management into organizational culture, all employees become aware of the potential consequences of their actions, leading to more informed and strategic decisions. 3. Enhanced agility and adaptability: Businesses that prioritize risk management as a part of their culture are better equipped to respond to changes in the market or their operating environment. This adaptability helps organizations remain competitive and thrive even under challenging circumstances. 4. Better resource allocation: Integrating risk management into organizational culture allows companies to prioritize their investments and resources more efficiently. This prioritization helps ensure that the most significant risks are addressed first, enabling the organization to direct its efforts and resources more effectively. 5. Stronger stakeholder relationships: Having a strong risk management culture in place leads to increased transparency and communication with stakeholders, including shareholders, suppliers, and customers. This transparency helps build trust and strengthen relationships, ultimately contributing to the organization's long-term success. 6.

(ii) it is not possible to tell. (iii) no.","completion":"(iii) no. The statement \\"A man wearing a helmet and life-vest kayaking in the water\\" does not logically imply that \\"A man is drowning in the water.\\" It is important to analyze both statements for a comprehensive understanding. The first statement describes a man engaging in a watersport, specifically kayaking. He is taking precautionary measures by wearing both a helmet and a life-vest, which are considered as standard safety equipment when participating in such an activity. These precautions suggest that the man is knowledgeable about the potential risks involved in kayaking and is actively trying to avoid them. The second statement, \\"A man is drowning in the water,\\" describes a scenario where a person is experiencing life-threatening difficulty in the water, unable to keep their head above the surface and struggling to breathe. Drowning is a severe situation that may result in death if not acted upon quickly. Comparing both statements, there is no overlap or connection between the man kayaking and the man drowning. The kayaking man is equipped with safety gear, which is designed to minimize the risk of drowning and other accidents. A life-vest assists in keeping the kayaker buoyant, even in the case of capsizing or any other misfortune. Therefore, stating that he's drowning would contradict the initial information provided. In conclusion, the statement about a man wearing a helmet and life-vest while kayaking does not logically lead to the notion that the man is drowning in the water. The presence of appropriate safety equipment, along with no mention of any adverse or life-threatening situation, suggests that the man is engaged in a recreational activity with calculated risks, rather than experiencing a state of distress or danger."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. contains an answer for the question: Which old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house?, what is it ?

Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi.

I’m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals. One of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn’t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant. It’s free from parabens, allergens and aluminium and uses astringent plant extracts that shrink the sweat pores to reduce perspiration whilst natural herb sage acts as a deodoriser.

To give a detailed explanation of the entire process, let's go through each step: 1. Coal is loaded into the firebox: The firebox is a compartment in the steam locomotive where coal or other fuel is burned to produce heat. This heat is essential to creating steam which will drive the engine. 2. The boiler produces steam under high pressure: The heat generated from the burning coal heats up water in a boiler, turning it into high-pressure steam. This steam is the main power source for the locomotive's movement. 3. The steam generated in the boiler flows down into a cylinder: The high-pressure steam from the boiler is directed into one or more cylinders, which house tight-fitting plungers called pistons. The steam enters the cylinder and pushes against the piston. 4. Just ahead of the wheels, pushing a tight-fitting plunger, the piston: The piston is situated in the cylinder and, as steam flows into the cylinder, the pressure generated pushes the piston, causing it to move back and forth. 5. The piston is connected to one or more of the locomotive's wheels through a kind of arm-elbow-shoulder joint called a crank and connecting rod: The piston's movement is transferred to the locomotive's wheels through a system of rods and joints. The main component in this system is the connecting rod, which is attached to the piston and the crank. The crank is connected to the wheel axle, effectively forming an arm-elbow-shoulder joint-like mechanism. 6. As the piston pushes, the crank and connecting rod turn the locomotive's wheels and power the train along: The piston's movement, driven by the high-pressure steam, moves the connecting rod which, in turn, rotates the crank. This rotation of the crank is what ultimately transforms the back-and-forth motion of the piston into the circular motion needed to turn the locomotive's wheels and propel the train forward along the tracks. In summary, the final step of the process is the conversion of the piston's linear motion into the rotational motion of the locomotive's wheels, which moves the train forward on the tracks. This entire process is a result of burning coal or other fuel to generate heat, which is then utilized to create high-pressure steam in the boiler, ultimately powering the steam-driven piston and the train's movement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The explosion Friday damaged thousands of buildings and injured 1,000 people. Article:","completion":"Title: Rise of the Black Market: Claimed Meteorites in Russia Introduction In a bizarre turn of events, a black market for claimed meteorites has emerged in Russia, according to various state media reports. This development comes after the recent meteor explosion on Friday that led to widespread damage, affecting thousands of buildings and injuring over a thousand people. One may wonder why a black market for meteorites is forming, and how it's connected to the recent explosion. As we dive deeper into this unfolding story, we uncover the science behind these cosmic occurrences and the human fascination with extraterrestrial objects. Scientific Discovery: Fragments on Lake Chebarkul In the aftermath of the meteor explosion, scientists have been working tirelessly to gather data, analyze the fragments, and predict future cosmic events. Among their extensive research, scientists discovered several small fragments scattered across the frozen surface of Lake Chebarkul. According to them, these meteorite fragments could play a pivotal role in further understanding the nature of the meteor and the explosion that took place. The larger fragment, believed to be submerged beneath the frozen surface of the lake, could potentially offer more valuable insights into the meteor's origin and composition. However, the scientific community's pursuit of knowledge has seemingly collided with the opportunistic nature of treasure hunters. The emergence of this black market for claimed meteorites can be largely attributed to the widespread interest in unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos and, more importantly, potential financial gains. Meteorites, particularly rare ones, have the potential to fetch exorbitant sums in the collectors' market, where enthusiasts and collectors are ready to pay a premium for these otherworldly objects. The Explosion's Aftermath Friday's meteor explosion will go down in history as one of the most significant cosmic events in recent memory. The shockwaves generated by the impact were felt by thousands of residents and led to widespread panic and speculation. With shattered windows and damaged infrastructure, the event caused immense disruption to daily life and drew global attention to the possibilities of future meteor impacts. With the massive public interest in this significant event, it comes as no surprise that the meteorite fragments found scattered across Lake Chebarkul have become a hot commodity in the black market. Unscrupulous individuals seeking to benefit from this phenomenon have taken to scouring the lake's surroundings in search of pieces they can sell, and the demand appears to be substantial. The meteorite black market has attracted buyers from all over the world, from enthusiasts willing to pay substantial sums for a small piece of cosmic history to scientists and researchers eager to study the extraterrestrial specimens. However, illegal trading in meteorites not only hampers genuine scientific efforts toward understanding the meteor but also encourages exploitation and degradation of natural resources. Final Thoughts The emergence of the black market for claimed meteorites in Russia highlights the ongoing struggle between human curiosity and the ethical limits of science. With fragile natural resources at stake, the threats posed by such illegal trading practices cannot be understated. As we continue to uncover the mysteries and the vast expanse of the cosmos, it's crucial to respect the boundaries set by both the scientific community and the environment. The meteor explosion in Russia serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of the universe and the need to preserve the integrity of scientific research. Collectively, society must find a balance between exploring the cosmos and preserving the planet's unique resources to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The many found many aquamarine gemstones in the mine, but very few gold nuggets since the","completion":"entrance of the mine had been sealed off for decades due to an old legend that warned of a curse, leaving its depths untouched and the precious gold hidden from the world. As the adventurers carefully navigated through the dimly-lit, narrow tunnels, they marveled at the vivid blue-green hue of the aquamarine gemstones that seemed to be scattered haphazardly throughout the mine's walls. The gemstones seemed to shimmer and glint under the faint glow of their torchlights, as if inviting the explorers to pocket their unearthly beauty. Each person in the group couldn't help but feel elated at the sight of these precious gems, knowing that their worth would make their efforts worthwhile. However, the real prize, gold nuggets, were much more elusive in this seemingly perplexing labyrinth that made up the old mine. The rumors of gold had initially lured the group to this forsaken place, with tales of untold riches that were allegedly buried deep within the bowels of the Earth, just waiting to be unearthed. As the hours turned into days, the once-hopeful adventurers felt their spirits dampening, and doubts began to set in as to whether they would ever find the treasure they so desperately sought. Unbeknownst to the group, the reason behind the scarcity of gold nuggets lied within the old legend that the entrance of the mine had been sealed off due to the curse, placed upon it by the ancient spirits of the mountain as a punishment for their ancestors' relentless greed and desecration of the sacred land. The curse lay upon those who sought fortune in the mine, ensuring that they would find nothing but misfortune and danger within. It also kept the gold nuggets from sight, effectively hiding them from the greedy hands of those seeking wealth, no matter how long they searched. As the adventurers' morale deteriorated, the leader of the group, a grizzled veteran of previous treasure-hunting expeditions, attempted to rally his comrades with tales of their past successes and adventures, emphasizing the inherent risk of treasure hunting, and explaining that perseverance would eventually pay off. For a brief moment, this instilled new hope among the group, and they pressed on with renewed determination. Eventually, after countless hours of grueling exploration, one of the adventurers noticed a small gap in one of the walls, partially hidden behind an unassuming boulder. It appeared unnatural and intentional, as if constructed with purpose. With a sense of excitement, the group proceeded to remove the boulder and squeeze through the gap, only to discover a hidden chamber adorned with intricate carvings and seemingly ancient artifacts. And, much to their amazement, gold nuggets – a fortune beyond their wildest dreams – were scattered across the chamber's floor like leaves in a golden forest. As they stared in awe at the sight before them, they realized that they had finally uncovered the lost treasure they sought, and that they had done so by both embracing their determination and defying the old legend. The curse, it seemed, had finally been broken with their unyielding persistence, paving the way for their success and ultimately rewarding them with the gold nuggets they had desired."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Helen, 50, was college educated, married, worked in middle management at a financial services company and had good health insurance. She was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in 1990. She saw doctors with some of the best reputations. After an appropriate surgery, she was given high dose chemotherapy with a bone marrow transplant. The treatment almost killed her several times and she was hospitalized for nearly a year. My book, \\"How We Do Harm,\\" co-authored with Paul Goldberg describes the challenges that some ordinary Americans experience while trying to get quality health care. In the book we show real examples, like Helen, of the irrationality of how medicine is practiced and consumed in the United States. We discuss those who do not get good care and those who suffer because of excessive and illogical health care. Both occur among the insured and the uninsured. The book also assesses the threat our health care system poses to the economy and offers suggestions on what needs to change. It was motivated by the ongoing debate about health care reform. For more than two decades, I have studied disparities in health outcomes and the inconsistencies in how medicine is practiced. I have come to believe that much of the rhetoric for and against health care reform lacks the understanding that the issue involves human beings. Lost in that debate is the fact that a large number of our fellow Americans are suffering and dying avoidable deaths, because of lack of quality health care. I believe we should be both ashamed and furious about our health care system. America spends more per person on health care than any other country. Per-person costs are nearly 1.5 times higher than the second most expensive country. We simply do not get the outcomes we pay for. Among the nations of the world, we rank 50th in life expectancy and American life expectancy is decreasing. America is 47th in infant mortality, just better than Croatia. The therapy Helen received was expensive and commonly given to women with breast cancer in the early 1990s. During this time, numerous women sued insurance companies who did not want to pay for the therapy and nearly a dozen states passed laws saying insurance companies had to pay for it. There was one really good reason why the health insurers did not want to pay for high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant for breast cancer: No study had ever been done to prove it beneficial. Even without evidence, some patients and their doctors had faith that it worked. The procedure was common because some doctors taught that the transplant was beneficial to patients. Truth be told, it was very beneficial to the doctors and hospitals offering it. By 1999, well after Helen had recovered, three well-designed clinical trials were completed. They showed that bone marrow transplant and high dose chemotherapy, a treatment now common for nearly a decade and a half, was not better than the standard therapy and there were indications it was more harmful. This shows that even the well-insured often get substandard care. Medical gluttony, the inappropriate use and overuse of medical treatment, is not just adding unnecessary cost to health care. It can actually be harmful to the individual. Doctors deserve some blame for this mess. Appreciation of the science of medicine and the scientific method is often lacking. It is amazing the number of health care professionals who seemingly reject the scientific method. They prescribe treatments they believe to be appropriate as opposed to therapies that are known to be appropriate based on objective scientific evidence. This form of ignorance is a root cause of much of the overuse of medical therapy. Too often, doctors fail to distinguish what is scientifically known from what is unknown, from what is believed. This is beyond mere disagreement about interpretation of the science. There is often selective reading of the science, especially by those trained in a specialty wanting to advocate for it. Health care providers and the public often overlook the emotional and financial conflicts of interest of health care professionals. While I blame the medical profession, blame also rests on hospitals, drug and device manufacturers, insurance companies, lawyers, politicians, government and even with patients. I see hospitals advocating unproven screening and treatment while advertising for business. There are patient advocacy groups often funded by hospitals and medical manufacturers, who also advocate the unproven and instill in patients that they need what may be unnecessary and can be harmful. American medicine is big business. It is about 18% of the U.S. economy and growing. The average cost of a health insurance policy for a family of four is 19,400 per year. The expense of our inefficient health care system is a major drain on the economy. It is a major reason why employers are hesitant to hire and a reason why many employers cannot provide health insurance to employees. We have what could be an extraordinary health care system and some patients do get extraordinary care. But patient stories show how our system is inefficient. Our system is focused on treating people after they get sick with relative inattention to promoting health and preventing disease. Such public health efforts have not received adequate support. The triad of obesity, lack of physical activity and high caloric intake (bad diet) is creating a tsunami of chronic disease. If the system persists as is, medical costs will grow dramatically over the next several decades as the number of patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and orthopedic injury dramatically grows. The current course is not sustainable. Medical costs will rise until the economy collapses. I know that the book will upset and anger some people, especially those who profit from medicine. I hope the book allows some reasonable people (both lay and medical professionals) to better understand what we are doing to our country. We all need to realize that some Americans are harmed by lack of treatment and others by overtreatment. The cold hard reality is America does not need to reform health care, we need to transform health care. The American health care system is fundamentally flawed and encourages inappropriate behavior and a subtle form of corruption. There truly is a combination of greed, ignorance and apathy within health care that is a cancer on this country. There is nothing wrong with medicine as a business, and nothing wrong with making an honest profit. However, in some cases, greed needs to be replaced with public interest, a concern for the national good. We need a greater commitment to the practice of evidence-based medicine. Some politicians choose to scare people with words like \\"rationing medicine\\" and \\"death panels.\\" Truth be told, we all need to talk about defining the \\"rational use of medicine.\\" A widespread demand for rational use of health care can lower costs and increase the number of people getting high quality care and save lives. Americans need to better understand the science of medicine and the scientific method, be true to science and support evidence-based medicine. We need to embrace an interest in public health and adopt preventive strategies. The most important question we can ask is, \\"How can we provide all Americans with good high quality care to include preventive care?\\" Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of CNN, The American Cancer Society, or Emory University.

The two Northern Vietnamese cities that the US initially avoided bombing were Hanoi and Haiphong. To provide more context, during the Vietnam War, the United States conducted extensive bombing campaigns in North and South Vietnam. These bombing campaigns aimed at crippling the transportation network, limiting the flow of supplies and equipment, and pressuring the North Vietnamese government to end the war. Due to political reasons and concerns about the impact on international opinion, the White House tightly controlled the Air Force's bombing campaigns. As a result, until 1972, the US avoided targeting major cities in North Vietnam, particularly Hanoi, the capital, and Haiphong, the largest port city. Instead, the US Air Force focused on targeting jungle supply trails, with a particular emphasis on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which allowed North Vietnam to supply weapons, ammunition, and troops to its forces and Viet Cong guerrillas in the South. By bombing the trails and attempting to disrupt these supply chains, the US aimed to weaken and eventually bring the North Vietnamese government to its knees, thus effectively ending the conflict. The situation changed in 1972, when the US launched Operation Linebacker I and II, which involved bombing many strategic targets in Hanoi and Haiphong. Linebacker I began on May 10, 1972, and continued until October 23, while Linebacker II, also known as the \\"Christmas bombings,\\" took place from December 18 to December 29. Overall, the cited statement does accurately capture the early-stage restraint in U.S. bombing policy concerning the two major North Vietnamese cities of Hanoi and Haiphong, as well as the shifting focus towards bombing jungle supply trails, particularly the Ho Chi Minh Trail."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: accomplished B: incompetent C: lazy Answer:","completion":"Answer: A: accomplished Based on the context provided, it is most likely that Jesse would feel accomplished after completing eight years of school and earning her degree through hard work. Graduating from school after such an extended period demonstrates her dedication, commitment, and determination to achieve her academic goals. These are all qualities of an accomplished individual who has achieved a significant milestone in their personal and educational development. Answer B, incompetent, is not accurate in this context because the information provided indicates that Jesse worked hard to earn her degree. Someone who feels incompetent might not be successful in their studies or might struggle to complete tasks effectively. However, Jesse's hard work and degree clearly demonstrate her competence in her chosen field of study. Answer C, lazy, is also inappropriate based on the context. Jesse's investment of eight years in school and her hard work in earning her degree are strong indicators of a diligent and committed attitude, rather than a lazy one. A lazy individual might quit school earlier or make no effort to succeed academically, neither of which appears to be the case for Jesse.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: As a predominantly Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of Ireland, or at least those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. The English scholar D. D. R. Owen, who specialises in the literature of this era, writes that \\"Professional storytellers would ply their trade from court to court. Some of them would have been native Scots, no doubt offering legends from the ancient Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when appropriate, but in French for most of the new nobility\\". Almost all of these stories are lost, although some have come down in the Gaelic or Scots oral tradition. One form of oral culture extremely well accounted for in this period is genealogy. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the Mormaers of Lennox and Moray to the Scottish king himself. Scotland's kings maintained an ollamh righe, a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations.Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. Dauvit Broun has shown that a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, in places such as Loch Leven and Brechin into the thirteenth century, However, surviving records are predominantly written in Latin, and their authors would usually translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with researching a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, Gilla Brigte became Gilbert, Áed became Hugh, etc. As far as written literature is concerned, there may be more...

Robert Dennis Crumb (; born August 30, 1943) is an American cartoonist and musician who often signs his work R. Crumb. His work displays a nostalgia for American folk culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture. Crumb is a prolific artist and contributed to many of the seminal works of the underground comix movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, Zap Comix, contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the East Village Other and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. In January 1967 Crumb came across two friends in a bar who were about to leave for San Francisco; Crumb was interested in the work of San Francisco-based psychedelic poster artists, and on a whim asked if he could join them. There, he contributed upbeat LSD-inspired countercultural work to underground newspapers. The work was popular, and Crumb was flooded with requests, including to illustrate a full issue of Philadelphia's Yarrowstalks. Independent publisher Don Donahue invited Crumb to make a comic book; Crumb drew up two issues of Zap Comix, and Donahue published the first in February 1968 under the publisher name Apex Novelties. Crumb had difficulty at first finding retailers who would stock it, and at first his wife took to selling the first run herself out of a baby carriage. Crumb met cartoonist S. Clay Wilson, an art school graduate who saw himself as a rebel against middle-class American values and whose comics were violent and grotesque. Wilson's attitude inspired Crumb to give up the idea of the cartoonist-as-entertainer and to focus on comics as open, uncensored self-expression; in particular, his work soon became sexually explicit, as in the pornographic Snatch he and Wilson produced late in 1968. The second issue of Zap appeared in June with contributions from Wilson and poster artists Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin. In December, Donahue published the still-unreleased issue as #0 and a new third issue with Gilbert Shelton joining the roster of regulars. Zap was financially successful, and developed a market for underground comix. Crumb was a prolific cartoonist in the late 1960s and early 1970s; at his peak point of output he produced 320 pages over two years. He produced much of his best-known work then, including his Keep on Truckin' strip, and strips featuring characters such as the bohemian Fritz the Cat, spiritual guru Mr. Natural, and oversexed African-American stereotype Angelfood McSpade. During this period, he launched a series of solo titles, including Despair, Uneeda (both published by Print Mint in 1969), Big Ass Comics, R. Crumb's Comics and Stories, Motor City Comics (all published by Rip Off Press in 1969), Home Grown Funnies (Kitchen Sink Press, 1971) and Hytone Comix (Apex Novelties, 1971), in addition to founding the pornographic anthologies Jiz and Snatch (both Apex Novelties, 1969).

Article:","completion":"Title: A Historic Sighting: Rare Butterfly Returns to Britain's East Coast after 60 Years Introduction: Conservationists in Britain have recently been filled with excitement and awe as a rare butterfly, the Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell, has been sighted on the east coast for the first time in over six decades. Previously, the only recorded sighting of this butterfly species in Britain occurred in 1953. Experts now believe that the butterfly may have migrated from Eastern Europe, triggering discussions about climate change's impact on migratory patterns and biodiversity. The Mysterious Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell: The Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell (Nymphalis xanthomelas) is a visually stunning butterfly species known for its striking orange wings marked with black spots and scalloped edges. As its name suggests, one of its distinguishing features is its yellow legs. While relatively common in Eastern Europe and Asia, the Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell has been historically rare in Britain, making this recent sighting a critical event for experts and conservationists studying the butterfly population in the region. A Long-Awaited Return: The last recorded observation of the Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell in Britain took place in 1953. Thus, when the butterfly was spotted on the east coast recently, it generated immense excitement among conservationists and entomologists. Furthermore, this sighting comes at a time when the British government is increasingly investing in the protection and restoration of native habitats, with a particular focus on insect populations. The Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell's return serves as an essential reminder of the importance of preserving biodiversity and monitoring rare species to better understand their presence in various ecosystems. Migrating from Eastern Europe: One of the leading theories for the Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell's presence on Britain's east coast is migration from Eastern Europe. Researchers suggest that the butterfly's reappearance could be due to increasing globalization, which has inadvertently played a role in the movement of various species across the globe. Additionally, climate change might also be affecting the migratory patterns of butterflies, as warmth-loving species expand their range in response to rising temperatures. The Impact of Climate Change: As experts continue to study the factors contributing to the Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell's return, the impact of climate change on butterfly migration cannot be ignored. Research has shown that climate change alters the habitats and migration patterns of various species, directly impacting their survival and distribution. For instance, warmer temperatures may create opportunities for butterflies to colonize new areas, potentially contributing to the Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell's dramatic reappearance in Britain. The Role of Conservation: The sighting of the Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell underlines the significance of conservation work in preserving habitats and biodiversity. With scientists and conservationists increasingly concerned about the effects of climate change on species distribution, the focus on the study of rare and endangered species has heightened. These findings are crucial for understanding how humans can aid in the protection and preservation of our planet's unique and diverse ecosystems. Conclusion: The recent spotting of the rare Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell on Britain's east coast has sparked a wave of excitement among conservationists and researchers alike. As experts delve deeper into understanding the butterfly's presence after 60 years, it serves as a reminder of the importance of conservation efforts and understanding climate change's impact on wildlife migration and biodiversity. Recognizing the significance of these findings will hopefully encourage more advocacy for habitat protection and the study of rare species, ensuring a vibrant future for the world's ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"Because she was treated like a liar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros is an American indie folk band formed in 2007, led by singer-songwriter Alex Ebert. Their musical style draws predominantly from folk and indie rock, with additional influences from psychedelic rock, gospel, and country music. The band emphasizes rich vocal harmonies, lively percussion, and eclectic instrumentation (including the accordion, guitarron, and banjo). The result is a distinctive sound that is both celebratory and nostalgic, evoking 1960s folk-rock acts while presenting a modern sensibility. Key influences and contemporaries of Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros include Mumford & Sons, The Lumineers, and Of Monsters and Men. The indie folk genre encapsulates a range of styles but generally features a strong emphasis on acoustic instruments, evocative melodies, and introspective lyricism. The Script, on the other hand, is an Irish pop rock band formed in 2007, comprised of lead vocalist Danny O'Donoghue, guitarist Mark Sheehan, and drummer Glen Power. Their music primarily draws from a blend of pop, rock, and alternative genres, and is characterized by catchy hooks, anthemic choruses, and heartfelt ballads. The Script's music often incorporates elements of hip-hop, R&B, and soul, making their sound highly accessible and radio-friendly. In comparing bands, The Script shares the pop-rock space with acts such as Maroon 5, OneRepublic, and Imagine Dragons. The band's discography showcases a talent for creating memorable, emotional songs that resonate with a wide audience.

Between 1519 and 1523 there was a succession of heavy battles and smaller skirmishes, in the course of which many towns and villages were devastated. After futile sieges of the defences of Calenberg and Hildesheim by troops from Hildesheim or Brunswick as well as numerous trails of devastation and plundering by both sides against the civilian population, the two sides finally met on 28 June 1519 at the Battle of Soltau . The Hildesheim army scored an emphatic victory against the Brunswick-Welf troops, killing some 3,500 men and capturing one of their leaders, Eric of Calenberg, as well as many of the nobles. This signalled the end of the opening phase of the war. However, an appeal to the newly elected emperor, Charles V, who had a good relationship with Wolfenbüttel, saw the situation entirely reversed at a political level. The ruling imposed by Charles V provided for the surrender of all conquered territory and release of all the prisoners, and thus ruled very much against the Hildesheim side. Because it was ignored by the bishop and his allies, the emperor's decision was followed in 1522 by the imposition of an imperial ban, the execution of which was assigned to the princes of Wolfenbüttel and Calenberg. Whilst Henry of Lüneburg had already gone into exile in France in 1520 having transferred the reins of power to his sons and in doing so keeping the Principality of Lüneburg out of the subsequent conflict, there were renewed military clashes between the Hildesheim prince-bishop and his opponents that were not finally resolved until the so-called 'field peace' of 15 October 1521.

Q:SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \\"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\".

Focus on negative feedback: The reviewer focuses only on the negative aspects of the system's storage, without providing any indication of redeeming features or usefulness. This makes the review lean towards a less favorable rating. 2. Lack of clarity: The wording of the review is somewhat unclear, particularly in the sentence, \\"I am not able to use some of my app just because this app is not updated.\\" It is not evident whether they are referring to the storage system or a particular app being incompatible with the system, which may cause confusion for readers. 3.

Absence of constructive criticism: The review solely expresses dissatisfaction, without offering any advice for potential improvements or as to how the issue could be resolved. Constructive criticism is essential for reviews, as it helps developers or service providers enhance their offerings and address user concerns.

If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders?

Step 3: Compare the Remaining Options We then compare 'canned goods,' 'grocery store,' and 'department store.' Among these, 'canned goods' can be dismissed because lettuce is typically fresh produce, not a canned item. But while it's possible to find lettuce in a department store, it isn't the first choice for most people for grocery shopping.

Write an article based on this \\"The reasons why some people get deep vein thrombosis (DVT) more than once are being researched by scientists in Swansea.\\"","completion":"Title: Unraveling the Mystery of Recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis: Swansea Scientists Investigate Introduction Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a severe medical condition that occurs when blood clots form in the deep veins of the body, typically the legs. The clots can lead to pain, discomfort, and potentially lethal complications like pulmonary embolism. While preventive measures can be taken to minimize the risk of DVT, some people still experience recurrent episodes. Scientists at Swansea University are now conducting research to understand why certain individuals are more susceptible to multiple occurrences of DVT. Step 1: Explore Genetic Factors One of the primary avenues of inquiry in this research is the role of genetics in DVT susceptibility. Some people are predisposed to forming blood clots due to genetic factors, which could explain recurring episodes of DVT. By investigating the genetic factors associated with recurrent DVT, researchers hope to identify specific genetic markers that will help in the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Step 2: Assess the Role of Lifestyle Factors Apart from genetic factors, various lifestyle factors could contribute to the recurrence of DVT in some individuals. These factors include obesity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and certain medications. Swansea researchers will explore whether specific lifestyle elements and their combinations increase the risk of recurrent DVT. By understanding these factors, healthcare professionals can provide personalized lifestyle recommendations for individuals who have experienced a DVT episode to reduce the risk of recurrence. Step 3: Examine the Efficiency of Existing Preventive Measures Another important aspect of the research is evaluating the effectiveness of existing preventive measures for DVT, such as wearing compression stockings and taking blood thinners. Scientists at Swansea will examine whether certain individuals may benefit more from specific prevention strategies or if additional measures need to be taken for those at higher risk for recurrence. Step 4: Develop Diagnostic Tools and Treatment Plans Upon identifying the primary factors behind recurrent DVT, the researchers aim to develop diagnostic tools that can accurately predict the risk of recurrence in individuals. Additionally, they will explore new treatment plans tailored to each person's unique risk profile. This personalized approach will greatly enhance preventive measures and reduce the need for invasive treatments like surgery. Conclusion Understanding why some people experience recurrent episodes of deep vein thrombosis is crucial in developing precise preventive and treatment measures. Swansea researchers' investigation into genetic, lifestyle, and preventive factors associated with recurring DVT is poised to break new ground in this area. Their findings will ultimately aid in protecting those at risk and save lives by minimizing the threat of deadly DVT complications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By using the stolen missiles Answer:","completion":"Title: The Carver Conspiracy Step 1: Introduction of Carver and establishment of his goals In the opening scenes, the film introduces Benjamin Carver, a powerful and influential businessman with a hidden agenda: the destruction of the Chinese government. He believes that the current regime threatens the global economy and obstructs his business expansion plans in Asia. Carver's grand scheme is to launch a series of stolen missile attacks on key Chinese government targets, making it look like an act of rogue terrorists, and manipulate the media to show that the current regime is too weak to protect its people, thus instigating a rebellion. Step 2: Establish the motivation for stealing the missiles To avoid linking himself directly to the missile attacks, Carver needs a credible scapegoat. He chooses a radical group known for their extremism, subsequently funding, infiltrating, and manipulating the group with the help of his own network of spies and assassins. Step 3: Introduce the protagonist and their mission Lucy Reynolds, an intelligent and skilled CIA operative, becomes aware of Carver's activities and sets out to uncover the truth behind his malevolent intentions. She is tasked with unravelling the conspiracy and stopping the missile attacks before they can be carried out. Step 4: Investigative action sequences Lucy starts her investigation by infiltrating Carver's company, posing as his new secretary. Throughout her time there, she discovers numerous clues that lead her to believe that Carver's intentions are far more sinister than anyone could have imagined. Throughout the film, she encounters dangerous operatives, deception, and high-stakes gambles in her quest for the truth. Step 5: Reveal the extent of Carver's plans As Lucy uncovers more information, she realizes that Carver is not only planning to destroy the Chinese government but also aims to expand his own corrupted empire by orchestrating the uprising of a new regime more susceptible to his control. This information strengthens Lucy's resolve to stop Carver at any cost. Step 6: Race against the clock to stop the missile attacks Armed with the knowledge about Carver's true intentions, Lucy races to track down the stolen missiles. Along her journey, she faces obstacles and confrontations, climaxing in a final showdown with Carver's henchmen at the missile launch site. Step 7: Resolution and aftermath Lucy successfully disarms the missiles just seconds before they are launched, thwarting Carver's plans for destruction. She hands over the evidence to the appropriate authorities, allowing them to apprehend Carver and his accomplices for their crimes. A sense of normalcy returns as order is restored, thanks to Lucy's tireless efforts. Step 8: Potential for a sequel In the final scene, viewers learn that one of Carver's most trusted allies managed to escape. The film ends on a cliffhanger, leaving room for a sequel where Lucy continues her mission to dismantle Carver's entire network and protect the world from their nefarious ambitions."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What key details about paweł zalewski can be extracted from the following bio?

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 7,289. - Built in 1855 , the Mayhew Cabin and Historic Village in Nebraska City , Nebraska is the only Underground Railroad site in Nebraska officially recognized by the National Park Service . It is included among the sites of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom . - The Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses established in the United States during the early-to-mid 19th century, and used by African American slaves to escape into free states and Canada with the aid of abolitionists and allies who were sympathetic to their cause. The term is also applied to the abolitionists, both black and white, free and enslaved, who aided the fugitives. Various other routes led to Mexico or overseas. An earlier escape route running south toward Florida, then a Spanish possession, existed from the late 17th century until shortly after the American Revolution. However, the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad was formed in the early 1800s, and reached its height between 1850 and 1860. One estimate suggests that by 1850, 100,000 slaves had escaped via the \\"Railroad\\". - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States.

Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas. - The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all U.S. national parks, many American national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations.

It revised upwards the growth figures for years between 2011 and 2013, which meant that the economy is now 5.9% above its pre-recession peak, compared with previous estimates of 5.2%. It also means that the economy passed its pre-recession level in the second quarter of 2013, which was a quarter earlier than previously thought. \\"Upward revisions to GDP in earlier years mean that growth has averaged just over 2% in the six years since the economy started growing again in mid-2009,\\" said Andrew Sentance at PwC. \\"This is respectable growth in the new normal post-crisis world and puts the UK among the leading major western economies - alongside the US and Germany - in terms of growth over the recovery as a whole.\\" The third estimate of growth in the second quarter was 0.7%, unchanged from the previous estimate.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Jane Austen is the younger daughter of Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father. Thomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \\"typical\\" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love. Tom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich \\"Madame La Comtesse\\" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of First Impressions, the manuscript that will become Pride and Prejudice. However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage.

A:","completion":"A: The last step of the process could be: - Long-term and irreversible climate change impacts ecosystems, biodiversity, and human civilization As the Earth continues to warm due to increased levels of trapped energy, it causes a chain reaction of events that exacerbate climate change and result in dire consequences for ecosystems and human societies alike. Rising temperatures influence weather patterns, leading to more extreme and frequent events like storms, droughts, floods, and heatwaves. This disruption of the Earth's natural climatic balance puts immense stress on ecosystems, pushing numerous plant and animal species towards extinction as their habitats alter or vanish. Moreover, the loss of biodiversity, compounded by deforestation, creates a vicious cycle. Fewer trees and plants mean less capacity for absorbing carbon dioxide, which contributes to further warming. Ocean temperatures also rise, negatively affecting marine life and causing thermal expansion, which leads to rising sea levels. As a consequence, many coastal areas and islands become vulnerable to erosion, flooding, and loss of habitable land. The melting of polar ice caps and glaciers is another troubling result of the warming planet. This not only contributes to rising sea levels but has severe implications on the Earth's climate system. The retreat of ice in the Arctic has ramifications for the ocean's circulation system, which may cause drastic seasonal changes and affect weather patterns in several regions worldwide. These long-term and irreversible climate change impacts threaten food production, water availability, and public health. Disruptions in agriculture due to shifting weather patterns may lead to food shortages, famine, and higher prices, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. The availability of freshwater resources may also be jeopardized, stoking conflict and competition for supplies. Furthermore, the spread of diseases-carrying vectors like mosquitoes could increase as rising temperatures provide new breeding grounds, posing significant challenges to public health and the global healthcare system. Lastly, climate change often exacerbates social and economic inequalities, potentially causing political upheaval, forced migration, and conflict, which may strain relationships among nations and communities. The surge in climate refugees and the competition for resources can lead to heightened geopolitical tensions and create instability around the world. In conclusion, the last step of this process is marked by significant long-term and irreversible climate change impacts that threaten ecosystems, biodiversity, and human civilization as a whole. To mitigate these consequences, it is vital to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, promote sustainable land management practices, and invest in renewable energy sources, among other environmentally responsible initiatives."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Question: Process: - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter - The overall planet is hotter. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose people use more fuel for travel happens, how will it affect everyone on earth becomes vegan. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The given process describes the greenhouse effect where the sun's heat enters the atmosphere, and greenhouse gases from various sources on Earth, such as industries, transportation, and agriculture, trap the heat within the atmosphere. This trapped heat leads to an increase in average global temperatures, causing various environmental issues such as global warming and climate change. The proposed perturbation hypothesis involves two scenarios: an increase in fuel consumption for travel and a global shift towards veganism. We will analyze each scenario to understand their potential direct and indirect effects on the process. 1. Increase in fuel consumption for travel: An increase in fuel consumption for travel entails the enhanced burning of fossil fuels in transportation, such as gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel. The combustion of these fuels leads to the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. These added greenhouse gases intensify the trapping of heat within the atmosphere, thereby amplifying the greenhouse effect and exacerbating the consequences of climate change. This scenario directly impacts the process, as it contributes to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions and temperature increases on Earth. 2. Global veganism: A global shift towards veganism means that a significant portion of the world's population would cease consuming animal products and instead, focus on plant-based diets. The impact of this shift on the greenhouse effect could be both direct and indirect. Direct impact: The global livestock industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in approximately 14.5% of total global emissions, as per the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. These emissions occur through enteric fermentation in ruminants, manure production, and the use of fossil fuels in the entire supply chain. A transition to veganism would markedly reduce the demand for animal products, leading to a decline in livestock production and a corresponding reduction in greenhouse gas emissions stemming from that industry. Consequently, there would be lesser greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thus alleviating the greenhouse effect and its negative impacts. Indirect impact: Another consequence of the large-scale adoption of veganism would be the decrease in land and resource use currently dedicated to livestock farming. This could allow for the restoration of forests and other natural ecosystems on former grazing lands, helping sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Furthermore, reduced deforestation for animal agriculture would preserve existing carbon reservoirs, thereby mitigating the release of additional CO2 into the atmosphere. Additionally, a shift towards plant-based diets demands less water and reduces the pollution of water bodies, indirectly contributing to a more sustainable environment with fewer greenhouse gases. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation scenarios have both direct and indirect effects on the process. An increase in fuel consumption for travel directly exacerbates the greenhouse effect by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, while a global shift to veganism can directly and indirectly alleviate the greenhouse effect by reducing the livestock industry's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and allowing for potential carbon sequestration through reforestation. Understanding these effects is crucial for policymakers to devise effective strategies for mitigating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future for the planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

FWL-T4: This appears to be a model or a product number. This helps to further specify the exact product being referred to, differentiating it from other, potentially similar products. It provides a specific reference that customers or suppliers can use to identify this exact product. 5. Exporters: The last word in the phrase likely refers to the parties responsible for the widespread distribution of the specified item. Exporters are businesses or individuals who send goods or services from one country to another. So when you add spaces, it should look like this: \\"China led firework light FWL-T4 exporters\\". This phrase thus refers to exporters based in China who are dealing with a specific model, FWL-T4, of a LED firework light. In a detailed context, the phrase could mean a plethora of things. However, based on a general interpretation, it refers to a group of exporters located in China that specialize in the distribution and exportation of a specific model (FWL-T4) of LED firework lights. These exporters may be a company or group of companies shipping this specific product to international markets, promoting trade and global connectivity. This conveys the fact that the specific product, the FWL-T4 LED firework light, has a global presence beyond its production origin in China. To find or contact these exporters, one would have to conduct some research, preferably beginning with an internet search of the specified product, \\"China led firework light FWL-T4 exporters\\". This will likely yield results pertaining to the specific companies dealing in this product and their contact information. It may also prove useful to explore trade directories, databases, and industry-specific forums where such exporters are likely to advertise or maintain a presence. Additionally, participating in trade shows or international exhibitions could provide opportunities to interact with such exporters face-to-face and establish valuable business connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: This article: By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act.The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.Canada entered the Second World War in 1939.

Erin disliked reptiles. 2). Rebecca disliked reptiles. Complete the following sentence. Erin was more afraid of the Leopard Gecko crawling around than Rebecca because","completion":"Erin was more afraid of the Leopard Gecko crawling around than Rebecca because, although they both disliked reptiles, Erin had a deep-seated fear of them that stemmed from a traumatic childhood experience she had. When Erin was younger, she encountered a rather aggressive snake in her backyard, which then caused her to develop a crippling case of ophidiophobia - the fear of snakes. Over the years, her fear generalized to include all forms of reptiles, regardless of their size or nature. Even the seemingly harmless Leopard Gecko was enough to send shivers down her spine and cause her heart rate to elevate, quickly turning her face pale with terror. On the other hand, Rebecca's dislike of reptiles was more of a personal preference and mild discomfort, rather than a genuine fear. She found them to be a bit odd and off-putting, but would not go into a state of panic when faced with one. Unlike Erin, Rebecca had not experienced any traumatic events with reptiles, allowing her to maintain a certain level of composure when in their presence. She simply preferred to avoid them whenever possible, staying at a reasonable distance and not engaging with them directly. Furthermore, Erin had never made an effort to understand or appreciate the various species of reptiles - their unique characteristics, variations, and ecological importance. Her fear had blinded her to the potential beauty and fascination inherent in the diverse world of reptiles. Consequently, she was not aware that Leopard Geckos are considered, by many reptile enthusiasts, one of the more docile and harmless reptiles, often kept as pets due to their low-maintenance nature and unique appearance. With their gentle demeanor, Leopard Geckos pose no real threat to humans, which Rebecca, albeit not a fan of reptiles, understood. The underlying reasons for their respective aversions to reptiles significantly contributed to the differing levels of fear and anxiety that Erin and Rebecca experienced when being faced with the Leopard Gecko. Erin's deeply ingrained fear of reptiles, originating from a disturbing encounter with a snake in her formative years, combined with her lack of understanding and appreciation for the many species of reptiles, significantly amplified her reaction, leading her to feel much more afraid and uneasy compared to Rebecca, whose dislike was rooted in personal preference rather than any visceral fear or unresolved trauma."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie plot title: Weekend at Bernie's Movie plot: Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are two low-level financial employees at an insurance corporation in New York City. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the Labor Day weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partner Vito (Louis Giambalvo), Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed. However, after Bernie leaves, Vito decides Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his greed and his relationship with Vito's girlfriend, Tina (Catherine Parks), and orders that he be killed instead. Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and plans the murders with Paulie (Don Calfa), the hitman, on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, killing Bernie with a drug overdose. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they find Bernie's body. Before they can call the police, guests arrive for a party that Bernie used to host every weekend. To Larry and Richard's amazement, the guests are too engrossed in their partying to notice he is dead, with the dopey grin from the fatal injection and his sunglasses concealing his lifeless state. Fearing implication in Bernie's death, and wanting to enjoy the luxury of the house for the weekend, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, a notion that Richard finds absurd. Only the arrival of Richard's office crush, Gwen Saunders (Catherine Mary Stewart), convinces him to go along with Larry's plan.

Morganite's second blush Fashion has welcomed pink firmly into its fold for several seasons. Since the buzz over pink coats back in autumn/winter 2013 (decades ago, in fashion years), dirty, smudgy, pastel pink has almost replaced camel as the industry’s go-to neutral. And it seems that the jewellery world is following suit. Telegraph Luxury’s jewellery expert Annabel Davidson predicts that pink stones will take centre stage in 2016 – the year of “rose quartz and serenity”, according to Pantone – and one rosy stone is certainly enjoying a revival: morganite. A member of the beryl family, morganite was renamed in 1911 in honour of the banker and gem collector J. P. Morgan. Popular in the 1920s, in recent years it has grown in favour in the engagement ring world as a more affordable alternative to pink diamond. But it’s not just for that fourth finger. As semi-precious stones increasingly make their way into fine and high jewellery, traditional houses and contemporary jewellers are calling on morganite, making the peachy-pink stone far more than a poor man’s pink diamond. “For the past five to 10 years morganite prices have risen and this appears set to continue with increasing demand,” says Boodles director, Jody Wainwright, who leads the company’s gemstone sourcing. “At Boodles we love designing fabulous jewellery and when looking for inspiration outside of the more obvious gems, a set of stunning soft-pink morganites takes some beating for beauty.” Morganite’s blush tone makes it the perfect partner to ever-popular rose gold. Pomellato’s Bahia necklace is a gorgeous example, its chunky chain providing a tough counterpart to the feminine hues, while Dior sets an oval morganite spiralling from a pear-shaped diamond on a ribbon of pink gold in its oh-so-modern mismatched Diorama Précieuse earrings. Shaun Leane proves that pink can be edgy, with morganite and tourmaline clasped within the diamond-clad prongs of his Aurora ring, and Eva Fehren, the fierce and fashionable New York jeweller, last week Instagrammed a pair of spiked morganite studs with the caption “#toughluxury”. Pink doesn’t always have to be simply pretty. But pretty morganite is, whether erupting from pastel-coloured enamel in a cocktail ring by Amrapali, swinging from Theo Fennell’s bee earrings or dotted amongst pink opals in de Grisogono’s swoon-inducing Melody of Colours earrings, the milky opals highlighting the stone’s delicate, watery quality. Morganite shakes off its mid-range rep in spectacular style in exceptionally crafted one-of-a-kind jewels by Swiss jeweller Boghossian, such as the cocktail ring in which a four-carat old mine cut diamond gently “kisses” a peachy 30-carat stone. “Morganite radiates charm and tenderness. The fine pink hues of this beryl have always seduced me. It is bold and modern yet timeless,” says Albert Boghossian, the company’s CEO. Houses old enough to remember morganite’s initial discovery are also embracing its renaissance. Boodles’s ballet-inspired Pas de Deux high jewellery collection includes a 26.05-carat pendant of pure pink; a stone that’s notable due to its rarity. “High quality morganites are extremely rare,” explains Wainwright. “Madagascar produces the ‘real pink’ Morganites: the ones with the vibrant, Hubba-Bubba bubblegum-coloured crystal. These, particularly at the larger sizes (over 25 carats), are extremely hard to come across.” Which makes Boucheron’s Hopi ring, unveiled in Paris last July as part of its high jewellery ode to India, all the more impressive: a diamond-paved hummingbird drinking the pink from 47.68-carat morganite. The 2015 additions to Cartier’s Paris Nouvelle Vague collection include a sautoir necklace in which a tassel of pink pearls swings from a cushion-cut morganite, recalling the flapper spirit of the stone’s heyday; along with a rose gold cocktail ring where the vibrant stone tops a mound of pearls and spinels: three old-fashioned materials made mouth-wateringly new. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Morganite, a member of the beryl family, has been seeing a revival in the jewelry world, with both traditional houses and contemporary jewelers incorporating the rosy stone into their designs. Pink stone jewelry is expected to dominate in 2016, proving that the rise in popularity of morganite is more than just a trend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to arrange the same 4 digits. This can be calculated as 4! (4 factorial) which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 permutations. Step 3: For the first 4-digit number, we have 24 options. Since there are three numbers, the total permutations are 24 * 24 * 24 = 13824. Step 4: The probability of all three numbers having the same digits regardless of order is (1/24) * (1/24) * (1/24) = 1/13824. Question 2 - Probability of two 5-digit numbers having the same digits regardless of order: Step 1: There are 10^5 or 100,000 possible 5-digit numbers. Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to arrange the same 5 digits. This can be calculated as 5! (5 factorial) which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 permutations. Step 3: For the first 5-digit number, we have 120 options. Since there are two numbers, the total permutations are 120 * 120 = 14400. Step 4: The probability of both numbers having the same digits regardless of order is (1/120) * (1/120) = 1/14400. Now, let's compare the two questions. Question 1 asks about the probability of three 4-digit numbers having the same digits regardless of order. Question 2 asks about the probability of two 5-digit numbers having the same digits regardless of order. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they are asking about different scenarios: 3 instances of 4-digit numbers vs. 2 instances of 5-digit numbers. So, the answer is [A]. no"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Annie for the following movie plot: Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is a single woman in her late 30s. Following the failure of her bakery, she lost her boyfriend and her savings, forcing her to take a job as a sales clerk in a jewelry store and to share an apartment with an obnoxious roommate Gil (Matt Lucas) and his sister Brynn (Rebel Wilson). Her business's failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely. She has a no-strings-attached sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted (Jon Hamm) but hopes for something more from him. Her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), is virtually her only source of happiness. Lillian becomes engaged and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. At the engagement party, Annie meets Lillian's bridesmaids: cynical cousin Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey); idealistic friend Becca (Ellie Kemper); the groom's raunchy sister Megan (Melissa McCarthy); and Helen (Rose Byrne), the rich and beautiful wife of the groom's boss. Helen and Annie, who are jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian, take an instant dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together. Annie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a Brazilian steak restaurant for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop. However, Helen must use her influence to gain entry to the shop because Annie didn't make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the whole partyâ with the exception of Helen, who chose not to eat before the fitting âbecomes sick from food poisoning. Later, Annie's suggestion of a bachelorette party at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a trip to Las Vegas planned by Helen. Worried about her finances and too proud to accept a ticket paid for by Helen, Annie books a ticket in coach although the rest of the party flies first-class. However, the trip is cut short by an outburst from Annie, who had accepted a sedative from Helen because of her fear of flying. The plane makes an emergency landing in Casper, Wyoming; and the party takes a bus back home. Annie apologizes, but Lillian decides she wants...","completion":"What is the name of the main character, played by Kristen Wiig, in the movie where she faces a series of personal and professional challenges, takes on the role of Maid of Honor for her best friend Lillian, and has conflicts with the wealthy and influential bridesmaid, Helen?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Using a cricket bat would not be applicable in this context, since the young man is not participating in a cricket-related activity, and a cricket bat would not be used for mounting the bars. D.

Q:For more than twenty years scientists have been searching for signs of life on other planets. Most of these searches have been done over the radio. The hope is that someone in outer space may be trying to get in touch with us. Scientists also have sent radio and television messages on spaceships traveling through space, on the chance that someone may be receptive to such messages. Scientists are using powerful radio telescopes to listen to signals from about 1, 000 stars, all within 100 light years of earth. In addition, they will scan the entire sky to \\"listen\\" for radio messages from more distant stars. Using a computer, they will be able to _ more than eight channels at one time. Scientists are looking for any signal they stands out from the background noise. Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, scientists find that five percent are like our sun. Perhaps half of them have a planet like earth. Such a planet would be a reasonable distance from the star for temperatures to be right for the evolution of life. Based on the inhabitable(that can be lived in)planets in our galaxy, most scientists agree that chances are likely that one or more of these planets support some life. However, many scientists wonder whether intelligent life exists on other planets. Some believe that twenty years of searching without any intelligible messages shows that no one is out there. They say that the evolution of intelligence comparable to ours is unlikely. Other scientists believe that our search hasn't been long enough to rule out the possibility that intelligent life exists in our galaxy. Although our sun family is only about five billion years old, our galaxy is about 20 billion years old. In that time, some scientists think it is likely that civilization much more advanced than ours have developed. Perhaps these civilizations send us no signals; perhaps we have not recognized the signals they have sent us. If we hope to find intelligent life, these scientists believe that we have to keep looking.[ According to the passage, how many planets in our galaxy might be inhabitable? A) 5 billion. B) 10 billion. C) 15 billion. D) 200 billion A:","completion":"To answer this question, we can focus on the part of the passage that mentions the percentage of stars like our sun and the likelihood of them having a planet like Earth. The passage states that \\"Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, scientists find that five percent are like our sun. Perhaps half of them have a planet like Earth.\\" Step 1: Calculate the number of stars like our sun. 0.05 (5% in decimal form) * 200 billion stars = 10 billion stars like our sun. Step 2: Calculate the number of planets like Earth among those stars. 0.5 (half in decimal form) * 10 billion stars = 5 billion planets like Earth. So, the answer according to the passage is A) 5 billion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having more calm, unwindy days than usual can have a direct impact on the process of sediment transportation. When there are fewer windy days, the amount of sediment being picked up by the wind will decrease. The reduced wind activity means that sediments will have fewer chances of being carried away and dispersed to new locations. As a result, the overall transportation of sediments will be affected, and there may be an accumulation of sediments in a particular area due to the lack of wind to carry them away. Consequently, the perturbation of having more calm, unwindy days than usual does have an effect on the process of sediment transportation, leading to less sediment being transported overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Following the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union. The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party; Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Nikolai Podgorny, the head of state, among other leading Soviet officials. Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev. Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of \\"peaceful coexistence\\". A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin. Seeking to foster better relations with the United States, both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily. Nixon later described his strategy: I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist, if possible, the help of the Soviets and the Chinese. Though rapprochement with China and detente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves, I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war. At worst, Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing. At best, if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry, Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept. Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974. He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening. Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, detente, and MIRVs.

Question: Which is the first day of Lent? Answer:","completion":"The first day of Lent is known as Ash Wednesday. Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of the Lenten season, which is a 40-day period (excluding Sundays) of reflection, penance, fasting, and prayer observed by Christians in preparation for Easter. This significant Christian observance occurs 46 days before Easter Sunday and is mainly observed by Roman Catholics, Orthodox, Anglican, and some Protestant denominations. Ash Wednesday gets its name from the ashes that are placed on the foreheads of the faithful in the shape of a cross. These ashes are typically made from the burned palm leaves that were used in the previous year's Palm Sunday processions. The ashes serve as a physical reminder of mortality, symbolizing the biblical teaching that \\"from dust you are, and to dust you shall return\\" (Genesis 3:19). The act of placing ashes on the forehead also represents a sign of humility, repentance, and commitment to transformation and renewal during the Lenten season. The date of Ash Wednesday can vary each year since it is determined by the date of Easter, which is calculated through a complex combination of lunar cycles, solar cycles, and the Hebrew calendar. Generally, Ash Wednesday can fall anytime from February 4th to March 10th, depending on when the first full moon of Spring occurs. In addition to the ashes, fasting and abstinence are also observed on Ash Wednesday and remain an integral part of the Lenten journey for many devotees. Fasting is often a way to practice self-discipline, while abstinence involves refraining from certain luxuries or indulgences, such as meat or other foods, to develop an intentional focus on spirituality. During Lent, Christians are encouraged to dedicate more time to reflection, prayer, reading Scriptures, and engaging in acts of charity and kindness. This period provides an opportunity to renew and deepen their faith, particularly as they meditate on the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In conclusion, Ash Wednesday is the first day of the Lenten season, a crucial period of spiritual growth and reflection for Christians. Marked by the imposition of ashes on the forehead and various acts of fasting and abstinence, this day serves as a powerful reminder to believers of their mortality and the need for repentance and spiritual renewal as they prepare for the celebration of Easter."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Groups of about a dozen students each, led by an experienced guide, will go on ten-day camping trips to the mountains to study the plants and animals that grow and live there. Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities. At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected. But they don't mind at all. What they do mind is leaving the beauty of the wilderness and the good friends they've made to return to their normal lives in the city.

Question: If you're wet cleaning a floor while doing housework, what do you need? Options: A. fan B. energy C. vacuuming D. mop E. broom The answer is:","completion":"D. mop To effectively wet clean a floor while doing housework, you will need a mop. A mop is specifically designed to clean floors with water, cleaning solution, or other liquid cleaners, ensuring thorough and even cleaning across the surface. Using a mop helps remove dirt and grime, as well as disinfect the surface, depending on the cleaning agent used. Let's consider the other options provided: A. fan - A fan is a device that's used to create air circulation, generally to cool down a room or provide ventilation. While it may help to dry a wet-cleaned floor more quickly, it's not the primary tool you need to actually perform the task of wet cleaning. B. energy - While having energy is essential for effectively and efficiently completing any housework, including wet cleaning a floor, it is an abstract and intangible factor. It's not a physical tool or equipment necessary for the task itself. C. vacuuming - Vacuuming is a method of cleaning that uses a vacuum cleaner, which is designed to suck up dirt, dust, and debris from various surfaces such as carpets and floors. This option refers to a process, rather than a specific tool, and vacuum cleaners typically aren't meant for wet cleaning a floor, as they can become damaged by water. E. broom - A broom is used for dry sweeping, or removing dust and debris from hard floor surfaces. While a broom might be useful for preparing the floor to be wet-cleaned – by sweeping up loose dirt and debris before using a mop – it is not the optimal tool for wet cleaning the floor itself. In conclusion, the best option in line with common sense for wet cleaning a floor during housework is option D, which is a mop. Mops have specifically designed fibers or materials that can absorb and spread water or cleaning solution to clean the floor effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old.

The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts.

It’s the shift away from traditional hotel stays to temporary vacation rentals, booked by way of Airbnb. Airbnb is the scrappy 3-year-old startup inventing an entirely new online travel marketplace. It’s seeking to make unconventional couch, bedroom, apartment, home and even entire country rentals as ordinary as booking a stay at a Holiday Inn. And, it’s doing so rather successfully; Airbnb grew 800% from January 2010 to January 2011. Airbnb now has more than 130,000 listings in over 15,000 cities in 184 countries, with renters having booked more than 1.9 million nights via the service to date. It sees more than 3 million unique visitors per month, and 40% month-over-month growth on average. Plus, the Airbnb iPhone app has been downloaded more than 330,000 times. Once just three guys working out of a living room, the company now has 110 employees, working in offices around the globe. It’s even rumored to have raised a 100 million in a financing round valuing it at more than 1 billion. The no-longer-under-the-radar company is fielding a smattering of inbound interest from job seekers who believe an early position at the company could be as valuable a lottery ticket as an early seat at Google or Facebook. “Ever wonder what it was like to work at Facebook when it was just fifty people?,” Airbnb teases its job candidates. “Imagine building a website that sparked a movement. That’s the kind of opportunity we’re offering you at Airbnb.” Mashable spoke with Joe Gebbia, Airbnb’s co-founder and chief product officer, to learn more about the up-and-coming company’s culture and what it’s looking for in new hires. “Culture is incredibly important to us,” Gebbia says. “It took us three months to hire our first employee,” he adds. Gebbia and his fellow co-founders Brian Chesky and Nathan Blecharczyk were instructed early on to pay careful attention to hiring as the first 50 to 100 employees will define the DNA of the company. “We took it upon ourselves to get it right the first time,” Gebbia says of heeding that advice. “We set a definite culture right from the beginning.” How does Airbnb define its culture? “Inventive,” says Gebbia. “We’ve invented a new marketplace. There was no easy way to rent a person’s bedroom over the Internet, or book a vacation rental over the Internet,” Gebbia says. “There was no guidebook for us to turn to as we defined this new marketplace … we had to invent all along the way, and that permeates our culture today.” If you want to work at Airbnb — the company has more than 75 openings and plans to hire aggressively — you too should be highly inventive. Airbnb has a laundry list of qualities it’s looking for when interviewing candidates. Atop that list is a tangible passion for changing the travel industry. “We want those who align with our noble cause. It’s about more than making money; it’s about connecting people in countries all around the world,” says Gebbia. “Our social mission is to get people meeting each other, and we need people who align with that purpose.” The ideal Airbnb candidate is a resourceful self-starter who will need limited guidance. He or she must possess strong design sensibility — a quality stressed by Gebbia as second only to passion for the company. “You must have the ability to recognize good design and good user experience,” says Gebbia. “These are core things at Airbnb. It doesn’t matter which department you’re in. We’re ultimately a service and a product that lives or dies by user experience.” But, you’ll only get so far in the interview process with passion and design sensibility, because the startup is serious about selecting only the best and brightest talent. “We hire people who are smarter than us,” Gebbia says. You should also be a strong at teamwork, be trustworthy, possess integrity and have good character, Gebbia says. Interviewing for a job at Airbnb is a straightforward process. The company breaks down rolls into five pillars: product, community, customer support, finance and marketing. You’ll first meet with the hiring lead of a department. Next, you’ll meet with every team member in the department. Those who continue on in the process will meet with a cross section of the company, with someone representing each of the five pillars. If all goes well, you’ll end up face-to-face with two of Airbnb’s three co-founders for the final test. The interview process is formal in function only. Airbnb cares not what you wear — even flip flops or jeans are considered acceptable interview attire. Ultimately, the startup concerns itself most with the qualities mentioned above. A company that defines itself as inventive is looking for candidates who stand out — people who actually embody the word “inventive,” not just use it. Case in point, Christopher Lukezic, Airbnb’s director of marketing, commanded everyone’s attention — Gebbia and Chesky especially — when he applied with a comic book in lieu of a resume in the summer of 2009. At the time, Airbnb was getting hundreds of resumes (now it’s seeing thousands), all of which looked the same. “Christopher had illustrated a two-page comic book about why he wanted to work at Airbnb and who he was,” Gebbia recalls. Lukezic was hired in days. But Airbnb’s fastest hire was a front-end developer who redesigned the entire homepage of Airbnb.com. The developer emailed a link to his design, along with detailed explanation of why he wanted to work for the company. The link quickly made its way through the entire company. Two hours after receipt, Gebbia phoned that developer. By that night, the prospect was on a plane to San Francisco, and by the next day everyone had agreed to bring him on board. Airbnb set up its new headquarters in a lavish 20,000 square foot space in the Design District of San Francisco in late May.

The passenger pursues the dog, firing a rifle, until he is shot dead by Garry, the station commander.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Pope Accepts Resignation of Bishop Who Didn't Report Abuse (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) — Pope Francis accepted the resignation Tuesday of a U.S. bishop who was convicted of failing to report a suspected child abuser, answering calls by victims to take action against bishops who cover up for pedophile priests. Bishop Robert Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St Joseph in Missouri for nearly 10 years, resigned under canon law that allows bishops to resign early for illness or some “grave” reason that makes them unfit for office. But his resignation did not provide a specific reason. Finn, 62, is 13 years shy of the normal retirement age of 75. In 2012, Finn was found guilty of one misdemeanor count of failure to report suspected abuse and was sentenced to two years of probation, making him the highest-ranking church official in the U.S. to be convicted of not taking action in response to abuse allegations. Prosecutors say the diocese did not notify police until six months after concerns were raised in 2011 about the Rev. Shawn Ratigan, whose computers were found to contain hundreds of lewd photos of young girls. Since the convictions, Finn has faced pressure to resign, including local and national petition drives asking the pope to remove him from the diocese. The removal was praised by Marie Collins, a prominent member of Francis’ own sex abuse advisory board who had called for Finn to go and demanded that the Vatican hold bishops accountable when they fail to protect children. “Things are moving slowly, as I have said many times, but they are moving in the right direction!” Collins tweeted. Francis appointed Archbishop Joseph Naumann, head of the Kansas City, Kansas, diocese, to lead the Missouri diocese until Finn’s successor is named. In a letter to the diocese, Naumann said he prayed “that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing.” Naumann will retain his duties in Kansas. Finn, who apologized for Ratigan’s abuse and took measures to make the diocese safer for children, urged followers to pray for his successor. Sister Jeanne Christensen, a member of the Sisters of Mercy who has been a critic of Finn, said “it’s sad that it took so long.” “We have suffered a lot under him, and justice has finally been done,” Christensen said. “Let’s just wish him well. And now we need to get moving on to healing the diocese.” For Kansas City resident Andrew Miller, 23, a lifelong member of Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, Finn’s resignation will make attending Mass easier. After Finn’s conviction in 2012, he said, he would say, “I’m a Catholic, but_.” Now, “I’m ready to call myself a Catholic again.” “Why would I put money in a collection plate to pay for lawyers to defend sex offenders?” he said, adding that next time he attends Mass, he might contribute “in celebration of a new bishop.” Rebecca Randles, the attorney who represented the plaintiffs in several abuse lawsuits that have cost the dioceses millions of dollars, said Finn’s resignation was an important step for abuse victims and the diocese. “For survivors, there is a sense that as long as Finn was in charge, there would be no way they would have had closure on their own experience. He was a symbol bearer,” she said. “And this kind of abuse ripples across all the Catholic faithful.” One of Finn’s strongest advocates, Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said Tuesday that Finn had been a target of elements of the Catholic church who did not like the bishop’s strict adherence to Catholic teachings. “He’s a good man,” Donohue said. “No one called his office and complained specifically that their child was being abused. If he didn’t give a damn, he could have ignored it completely and told everyone in his office to ignore it. He didn’t. He called the authorities. The way he’s been treated is simply not fair.” No U.S. bishop has been forcibly removed for covering up for guilty clergy. Technically speaking, Finn was not removed — he offered to resign, in the same way that Boston’s Cardinal Bernard Law did in 2002 after the clergy sex abuse scandal exploded in his archdiocese. Law had not been convicted of a crime, as Finn was, and the failure of the Vatican to remove Finn for three years after his conviction fueled victims’ complaints that bishops were continuing to enjoy protections even under Francis’ “zero tolerance” pledge. In a statement, Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the online abuse resource BishopAccountability.org, said Finn’s resignation was a welcome step but called on Francis to publicly state that he was removed for mismanaging the Ratigan case and failing to protect children. She noted that bishops had been allowed to resign under the previous two popes, but that the Vatican has never publicly linked their resignations to mishandling abuse cases. “We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately. That would be unprecedented,” she said. “And it would send a bracing message to bishops and religious superiors worldwide that a new era has begun.” Winfield reported from Vatican City. Associated Press writer Hannah Cushman in Chicago contributed to this report. Correction: The original version of this story, using information from the Associated Press, incorrectly described the outcome of Bishop Robert Finn’s case.

They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is attacking the lungs, unwise sunbathing may do great harm. Today there is not just one school in the sun.

Please answer a question about the following article about Solar energy: Off-grid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary. How is the credit to households accomplished?","completion":"Credit to households for their solar energy contribution to the grid is accomplished through a process known as net metering. Net metering involves monitoring and crediting residents for the electricity their solar power system overproduces and feeds back into the grid. The process of net metering is facilitated by the bi-directional electricity meter that is installed in the serviced houses. In a grid-tied solar energy system, this meter plays a crucial role. It measures and records not only the electricity consumed by the household from the grid but also the excess electricity that the household's solar system feeds back into the grid. Here's how it works: When a household's solar power system produces more electricity than the house can consume at any given moment, rather than wasting the excess electricity, it is fed back into the grid. The electricity meter records this feed-in. On the other hand, during periods when the solar system doesn't generate enough electricity to meet the house's requirements (at night-time, for example, or during heavy cloud cover), the household draws the needed electricity from the grid. The meter, once again, keeps track of this. Net metering comes into play by using the meter’s records to calculate the net electricity used by the houses. The calculation is simple – the total amount of electricity consumed by the household from the grid is subtracted from the total amount of electricity the solar power system of the household feeds into the grid. If a house has produced more electricity than it has consumed, the net electricity use is below zero. In this situation, the utility company gives the household a credit by 'rolling over' the kilowatt hour to the next month. This essentially means that the house has a positive balance of electricity that it can use in the next billing cycle without incurring any cost. The net metering system thus directly relates a household's utility bill to its net electricity usage. If a household regularly produces as much electricity as it consumes, it could potentially lower its electricity bill to zero. While some systems might use two separate meters to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced, this approach is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters are capable of accurately measuring electricity in both directions, rendering a second meter unnecessary. This makes the process of net metering highly efficient and effective for grid-tied solar energy systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To understand this better, let's discuss how this works. The 'i' in this case is number 2, which means we want the first 2 elements of the list A. In Python, we can get this by using slice notation. For example, A[:i] would return the first i items in the list. Thus, A[:2] gives us the first two elements, which are '6321' and 'P'. Please remember that in Python and most programming languages, list indexes start at 0, and the end index in a slice is exclusive, which means it does not include the element at that index number. Thus, A[:2] gives us elements at indexes 0 and 1, which are the first and second elements respectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does \\"spread\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? A big oil spot spread across the water. She liked to spread butter on her toast while it was still hot.","completion":"In these two sentences, the term \\"spread\\" refers to the action of extending or covering a larger area, but the context and effect in each case are different. Let's delve into the different meanings of \\"spread\\" in these examples. In the first example, \\"A big oil spot spread across the water,\\" the meaning of \\"spread\\" focuses on the distribution or expansion of a substance (in this case, oil) over a certain area (the water) due to its inherent properties or external factors. The action of spreading in this context is a passive process, as the oil spot, which is a liquid, naturally disperses and occupies more space without direct human intervention. This change in size may happen due to the viscosity of the liquid, surrounding water movements, or external forces such as wind or currents. In the second example, \\"She liked to spread butter on her toast while it was still hot,\\" \\"spread\\" refers to a deliberate and controlled action carried out by an individual (the person spreading the butter on toast). In this context, the substance (butter) is distributed evenly over the surface (toast) to ensure full coverage and potentially improved taste. The process of spreading in this example is an active, intentional action that requires deliberate human effort to move the butter over the toast surface. In conclusion, while the term \\"spread\\" shares a common conceptual denotation of extension and distribution across a surface or area in both sentences, the processes and implications differ significantly. In the first sentence, \\"spread\\" refers to a passive, natural expansion of a substance due to its inherent properties or external factors.

Place tissue paper in between pages and place a heavy book on top. Step-by-step: 1. Evaluate the options: We have two options to dry a school notebook – using tissue paper or using printing paper. 2. Absorbency: Tissue paper is designed to be more absorbent than regular printing paper. This means it will be more effective in absorbing the moisture from the notebook pages. 3. Prevent ink bleeding: As tissue paper is more absorbent, it will help prevent the ink on the damp pages from bleeding. Printing paper, on the other hand, may not be as efficient in this regard and may lead to ink transferring between pages. 4. Minimize damage to pages: Since tissue paper is softer than printing paper, it is less likely to damage or scratch the notebook pages when placed in between them. 5. Place tissue paper: Gently separate the damp pages of the school notebook and place tissue paper in between them. Make sure the tissue paper is evenly covering the damp area of each page. 6. Add pressure with a heavy book: Place a heavy book on top of the school notebook to provide even pressure. This helps the tissue paper to absorb the moisture effectively. 7.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: A Shot in the Dark Context: Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is called to the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders) to investigate the murder of his chauffeur, Miguel Ostos. The chauffeur was having an affair with one of the maids, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), and attacked her in her bedroom after she broke off with him. Miguel was shot and killed in her bedroom and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he has developed an immediate attraction to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation. Dejected, Clouseau returns home. He is awakened in the early hours of the morning by an apparent attempt on his life by a Chinese assassin. When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Kato (Burt Kwouk), to whom Clouseau has given instructions to attack him when he least expects it to keep his senses sharp. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself. A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows. Each time the evidence points to Maria, who is continually arrested, only to have Clouseau release her again despite the growing number of murder charges laid at her feet. Clouseau's actions embarrass the SÃ»retÃ© in the press, but Commissioner Dreyfus is unable to remove him from the case because Ballon has exerted political influence to keep the unorthodox and seemingly incompetent detective assigned to the investigation.

News article: Policeman in Jordan Kills 5, Including 2 Americans (AMMAN, Jordan) — A Jordanian police officer opened fire Monday at a regional police training center in the Jordanian capital, killing two Americans, two Jordanians and a South African before being shot dead, the Jordanian government spokesman said. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media, said at one point that the death toll had apparently risen to eight, but Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed Momani disputed that figure. The attack also wounded seven people, including two Americans, three Jordanians and a Lebanese, Momani said. He said authorities are investigating whether the attacker’s motive was personal or political. Jordan, a close U.S. ally that has a peace treaty with Israel, has long been seen as an island of relative stability in a turbulent region. Over the past year, the pro-Western kingdom has taken on a high-profile role in the fight against extremists, including the Islamic State group, which controls large areas of neighboring Iraq and Syria. There has been concern that militants could carry out revenge attacks on Jordanian soil. Fayez Dwairi, a strategic analyst and former senior military officer, said he could not recall such a deadly shooting attack inside a Jordanian security compound in his 36 years in the military. The government did not release the identity of the attacker, but a former member of parliament said authorities told him the shooter was 29-year-old Anwar Abu Zaid. The ex-parliamentarian, Suleiman Saed, is a relative of Abu Zaid. Abu Zaid’s brother, Fadi, told The Associated Press that Anwar was mentally stable and “not an extremist at all.” He said his brother, a father of two, joined the security forces at age 18, had been working at the training center for several months and had left for work as usual on Monday morning. Fadi Abu Zaid said the family demands to know about the circumstances of Anwar’s death and will not accept his body until the authorities release more information. In Washington, President Barack Obama said the attacker had been dressed in a military uniform. “We take this very seriously and will be working closely with the Jordanians to determine exactly what happened,” Obama said during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. U.S. forces in Afghanistan have come under attack on a number of occasions by local police and troops serving alongside them, in what are known as “green-on-blue” assaults. Such attacks have been extremely rare in the Middle East. A U.S. official said the Americans who were killed and wounded in the attack were part of a State Department police training program. The official said all were civilians, but declined to identify them. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Momani said the Jordanian killed in the attack was a civilian employee at the center. He said the wounded are being treated at Jordan’s main military hospital and were visited by King Abdullah II. About two hours after the shooting, dozens of armored vehicles were moving in and out of the large, walled training center on the outskirts of Amman. The center was established in 2003, and has trained 53,000 police officers from Iraq, 8,000 from the Palestinian territories and additional groups from other Arab countries, according to its website. “We have full confidence in our security measures, and the investigation will uncover the motivation behind what happened,” Momani told The Associated Press. In an earlier statement, he referred to the shooting as a crime. Associated Press writers Karin Laub in Southern Shuneh, Jordan, and Bradley Klapper and Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"In Amman, Jordan, a regional police training center fell victim to a shooting attack by a Jordanian police officer, resulting in the death of five people, including two Americans, two Jordanians, and a South African. In addition to the fatalities, seven others were injured, including two more Americans, three Jordanians, and a Lebanese. The attacker, identified as Anwar Abu Zaid, was subsequently killed at the scene. The investigation is still ongoing, and the Jordanian government is looking into whether the attack was driven by personal or political motives. The U.S., an ally of Jordan and key figure in the fight against extremist terrorism in the region, along with President Barack Obama, is working closely with Jordanian officials to determine the exact motive and events that occurred during the attack. The police training center, which has trained over 53,000 officers from neighboring countries since its establishment in 2003, continues to operate, with statements from Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed Momani asserting full confidence in their security measures and procedures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Laughter healing benefits and healing with laughter have become synonymous with Norman Cousins, the man who laughed himself to wellness. Norman Cousins was the editor of SaturdayReviewfor over 30 years. His story began in 1964, when doctors found that the connective tissue in his spine was becoming worse, which is a condition known as Ankylosing Spondylitis . The doctors, one of whom was a close friend of Cousins, said that his chance of survival was approximately 1 in 500. He read about the theory that negative emotions do harm to the body, so he thought that if negative emotions were damaging to health, then positive emotions should improve health. Faced with the real possibility of his approaching death, Cousins thought long and hard and eventually did three things completely contrary to medical opinion. First he began his own research on all of the various drugs he was on. He discovered that his condition was removing Vitamin C from his body and, based on Cousins' personal research, doctors agreed to take him off several of the drugs he was on and inject him with large doses of this supplement , as Cousins felt this may be his last hope. Secondly, Cousins made a decision to check out of the hospital and into a hotel room. The third thing Cousins did was get a movie projector and a large supply of funny films. On his first night in the hotel Cousins found that he laughed so hard at the films that he was able to stimulate chemicals in his body that allowed him several hours of pain-free sleep. When the pain returned he would simply turn the projector back on and the laughter would help sleep, and he was able to measure the changes in his body by measuring his blood sedimentation rate , and found that this rate dropped by at least 5 points each time he watched one of these videos. The treatment proved to be so effective that in very little time Cousins was off all painkillers and sleeping pills. He found that the laughter relieved the pain and helped him sleep. He returned to work and wrote about his... Question: According to Norman Cousins' own research, _ may be good for his recovery.

Article: For 75 years, three words have influenced the lives of many young Brits.They are:mirror, signal,manoeuvre . These are the processes all drivers should perform.Learners hoping to pass their driving test need to prove that they understand the importance of these actions before they can throw out their L-plates and head for the highway.In Britain,L-plates ale signs with a red \\"L\\" on them which you attach to a car to warm other drivers that you are a learner. This summer the British driving test celebrates its seventy-fifth birthday.It's often described as one of the most frightening tests we face. It is a painful experience that doesn't come very cheap nowadays.Taking the test in 1935 cost just 37. 5 pence;now candidates can expect to pay PS93. The test is also harder than ever.In 1935,the pass rate was 63%; now it's 43%.In recent years,the DSA--the organization that oversees the driving test -- has looked for ways to assess different aspects of what makes a good driver Now the DSA has announced that candidates will drive for ten minutes without detailed instructions from the examiner.DSA'S chief driving examiner Trevor Wedge said the aim was to measure a candidate's ability to drive safely while making decisions independently. However,drivers will not be punished for getting lost. \\"Candidates won't be failed for going off route,\\" Mr. Wedge said. No doubt there will still be complaints. The BBC has learnt that in 2009 there were l,889 complaints about examiners,of which just 51 were supported. Complaints that were rejected included ''Candidate crashed during test--claims examiner distracted \\" and \\"Candidate says examiner took her on busy roads during rush hour,which was unfair\\". Someone else seemingly failed to understand the nature of an emergency stop when the complaint was filed that an emergency stop was conducted without warning.

Bitdefender is an antivirus software that provides comprehensive protection against various online threats such as viruses, trojans, and malware. It is designed to keep your devices and data safe, and it comes with a range of security features, including real-time scanning, firewall protection, and ransomware protection. One part of the software is My Bitdefender, which is an account management feature that allows users to access their Bitdefender subscriptions, manage their devices, and customize settings across all devices. However, as mentioned in the statement, the software seems to lack options for disabling My Bitdefender or stopping the login requests that appear regularly on the system. These login requests may be prompted when the software needs to access the My Bitdefender account to provide updates, download antivirus definitions, or communicate with the account owner regarding their subscription status. Nevertheless, there are ways to mitigate this issue, which is by working with the available settings within the Bitdefender software or operating system. Here is a detailed explanation of the possible steps you can take: 1. Review notifications and alerts: Go to the Bitdefender settings and carefully review all notifications and alert options. There may not be a direct setting to disable My Bitdefender or stop login requests, but adjusting these settings might help reduce the frequency or disruptiveness of login requests. 2. Check background processes and scheduled tasks: Review the background processes and scheduled tasks associated with the Bitdefender software on your computer. In some cases, you may find tasks that trigger login requests at specific intervals. Modifying or disabling these tasks could potentially help to stop the login requests. 3. Adjust automatic updates: Many antivirus software programs have the ability to automatically update their virus definitions to provide optimal protection. While it's essential to keep the software updated, you may explore the possibility of adjusting this setting to a time when you do not use the device actively. This way, the login requests that might be prompted during the updates won't interrupt your regular use. 4. Consider alternative antivirus software: If the login requests associated with the My Bitdefender feature are causing significant disruption and there isn't an option to disable it in the settings, you may consider looking for alternative antivirus software that doesn't require regular login prompts or allows greater control over when logins occur. 5. Contact Bitdefender customer support: For any unresolved issues, consider reaching out to the Bitdefender Customer Support team. They can provide further assistance and clarify whether there is a workaround for disabling My Bitdefender or stopping login requests within the software. They might also appreciate your feedback and consider implementing the option to disable My Bitdefender or control login requests in future updates.

Hillary Clinton's 2008 Concession Speech: In 2008, Hillary Clinton made her concession speech after losing the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama. Major aspects of this speech include: - Acknowledging her defeat and expressing her support for Barack Obama - Reflecting on her campaign and breaking barriers as a female candidate - Addressing issues such as health care, education, and the economy - Calling on her supporters to unite behind Obama to ensure the Democratic Party's victory in the general election 2. Hillary Clinton's 2016 Concession Speech: In 2016, Hillary Clinton delivered her concession speech after losing the presidential election to Donald Trump. Major aspects of this speech include: - Acknowledging her defeat and expressing her support for a peaceful transfer of power - Reflection on the progress made during her campaign and the importance of defending democratic values - Expressing gratitude to her supporters and campaign staff - Addressing issues such as gender equality, climate change, and justice reform - Encouraging the younger generation to continue fighting for their beliefs and values Based on my analysis, I can answer your questions: First question: The significant differences between her 2008 and 2016 concession speeches are: - In 2008, she conceded to a fellow Democrat and urged her supporters to unite behind him, while in 2016, she conceded to a Republican candidate and expressed her support for a peaceful transfer of power. - The focus of issues mentioned in both speeches was different, with 2008 highlighting health care, education, and the economy, while 2016 focused on gender equality, climate change, and justice reform. Second question: Hillary Clinton's speeches are valuable because they: - Provide insight into her political beliefs and priorities - Demonstrate the evolution of her political career and the issues she advocated for over time - Highlight the importance of democracy, unity, and social justice in American politics - Serve as primary sources for historical and political analysis As for the last question, it can be answered as follows: Are these two questions asking the same thing?

Here is a news article: Microsoft has published a new list of features that it will remove or deprecate in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, which is expected for general release in September. The most notable change is the deprecation of Paint, the graphics app bundled with Windows since Windows 1.0. The classic Paint app remained available with the recent Windows 10 Creators Update alongside Microsoft's new 3D Paint, a Universal Windows Platform app that was intended to replace Paint. Paint will still ship with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update; however, its deprecated status means the app is \\"not in active development and might be removed in future releases\\". A more definitive end is on the cards for the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) in the next version of Windows 10. EMET has a long history with Windows in the enterprise, offering admins tools to mitigate vulnerabilities in software that haven't been patched yet. Microsoft will drop support for EMET for all versions of Windows in July 2018, and has been urging customers to upgrade to Windows 10, which features many of EMET's exploit mitigations. But rather than abandon EMET for Windows 10, it recently revealed it would build it with additional capabilities into Windows 10 as part of a feature called Windows Defender Exploit Guard. Since then Microsoft has announced Exploit Protection, a feature of Exploit Guard available in the Windows Defender Security Center. Microsoft says EMET \\"use will be blocked\\" after the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and advises to \\"consider using the Exploit Protection feature of Windows Defender Exploit Guard as a replacement\\". Also marked for removal in the next Windows 10 release is the 3D Builder app, Outlook Express, the Reader app, Reading List, and Syskey.exe. Microsoft also lists recommended alternatives to the removed features. Update: Microsoft has now confirmed that MS Paint will live on, moving to a new home \\"soon\\", in the Windows Store where it will be available for free, according Megan Saunders, general manager of Microsoft's 3D for Everyone Initiative for Windows experiences. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications. You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history. Learn more ||||| Microsoft is considering removing the iconic Paint application from an upcoming update of Windows 10 after nearly 32 years in existence. In a list released by Microsoft, Paint has been labeled \\"deprecated\\", meaning it could be removed when the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update is released later this year. Paint was introduced with the first version of Windows, called Windows 1.0 in November 1985. It was originally a licensed version of PC Paintbrush which was made by ZSoft Corporation. In the beginning, it supported 1-bit monochrome graphics, and it wasn't until Windows 98 that users could save images in the well-known JPEG file format. Last year, Microsoft unveiled Paint 3D, a new version of the classic software. It is much more advanced, allowing users to create three-dimensional images. Other features going from the next Windows 10 update include Outlook Express and the reader app, which Microsoft said will be integrated into its Edge browser. Paint holds a certain nostalgia with many Windows users despite never really having huge functionality versus other apps such as Adobe's Photoshop. But the simplicity was perhaps what made it so popular. The Fall update of Windows 10 does not have a release date yet, and it's not completely confirmed whether Paint will be axed. But the prospect of the death of Paint is already getting some users upset on social media. ||||| Travel back in time Timeline lets you jump back in time to find what you were working on, whether it was 2 hours or 2 months ago.

Write an article based on this \\"Alcohol abuse centres will be dealing with the problem \\"for the next decade\\", one of Wales' biggest charities warned.\\"","completion":"Title: Alcohol Abuse Centers in Wales: Preparing for a Decade of Challenges Introduction Alcohol abuse has become one of the most pressing public health issues in Wales in recent years, with an increasing number of individuals succumbing to alcohol addiction. One of Wales' largest charities recently sounded a warning, stating that alcohol abuse centers will be dealing with this problem \\"for the next decade.\\" This dire prediction sheds light on the long-term consequences of alcohol abuse and highlights the importance of finding sustainable and comprehensive solutions to this escalating problem. The Dangers of Alcohol Abuse While moderate alcohol consumption can have some benefits to one's social life and bonding experiences, excessive alcohol intake has been associated with a myriad of health problems. Alcohol abuse has been linked to liver diseases, heart conditions, digestive problems, mental health disorders, addiction, and can even lead to life-threatening complications. Moreover, alcohol consumption can often lead to risky behaviors such as drunk driving, aggressive tendencies, and impaired decision-making, which in turn can result in accidents, fatalities, and criminal behavior, affecting both the abuser and innocent bystanders. The Rising Problem in Wales The Welsh Government reported that alcohol-related deaths had increased significantly in recent years, with \\"6.2% of adults in Wales drinking above the recommended guidelines.\\" The Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in Wales has also noted a massive influx of new and younger members seeking their assistance. This worrying trend has become a major concern, particularly for alcohol abuse centers responsible for treating and supporting those affected. Alcohol Abuse Centers: Facing a Decade of Challenges The charity's prediction that alcohol abuse centers would be grappling with this issue for the next ten years reflects several aspects of this complex problem: 1. Accessibility to treatment and support: With increasing numbers of people seeking help, alcohol abuse centers may face difficulties in accommodating them due to limited resources and capacity. This could potentially result in insufficient access to essential services, including therapy, medical care, and rehabilitation support. 2. Financial constraints on the healthcare system: Treating and rehabilitating individuals affected by alcohol abuse typically requires long-term care and resources. The strain on the healthcare system and taxpayers could be immense as the need for alcohol abuse services continues to grow in the next decade. 3. Societal impacts: The negative consequences of alcohol abuse do not occur in isolation. The social impacts, such as family breakdown, job loss, and community disruptions, can cause a ripple effect that continues to affect the nation in the upcoming years. 4. Prevention and intervention: Governments, health institutions, and charities must continue to establish and evaluate effective prevention and intervention strategies that seek to reduce and eradicate alcohol abuse. A decade of challenges indicates that the battle against alcoholism is far from over. Addressing the Issue: Building Sustainable Solutions To alleviate the burden on alcohol abuse centers and tackle this critical issue in Wales, several strategies need to be implemented: 1. Increasing funding and resources: Adequate allocation of resources and funding to alcohol abuse centers will be crucial to ensure that these facilities can accommodate the increasing number of patients. Moreover, financial support for public health campaigns and initiatives aimed at raising awareness can contribute to reducing alcohol abuse rates. 2. Expanding prevention and intervention programs: Government bodies and charitable organizations need to work in tandem to help create and strengthen prevention and intervention efforts. This may include school-based education programs, national public health campaigns, and targeted interventions for at-risk populations. 3. Addressing stigma and mental health: A comprehensive approach that includes mental health support and destigmatizing addiction is vital. Encouraging open, empathetic dialogues on the topic and offering more accessible mental health services can help in addressing the complex relationship between alcohol abuse and mental wellness. 4. Cross-organizational collaboration: Partnerships between government agencies, healthcare providers, and charities are essential to ensure coordinated efforts and sustainable solutions for the next decade and beyond. Conclusion Alcohol abuse in Wales is a formidable problem that will take concerted effort, seamless collaboration, and sustainable initiatives across various sectors to address. With a ten-year forecast of continued challenges and an increased burden on alcohol abuse centers, it is crucial for governments, healthcare providers, and charities to work as a united front to combat this alarming problem. By providing accessible treatment, engaging preventive measures, addressing mental health and stigma, and encouraging cross-organizational collaboration, a brighter future can be created – one where alcohol abuse is no longer a raging issue in Wales."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fidelity wins approval to expand in China The international arm of Fidelity Investments has taken a big step to expand its business in China, winning a license that makes it one of the first Western firms allowed to pursue billions of dollars in business with large investors there. Fidelity Worldwide Investment said last week that it was approved by the Chinese government to establish what’s called a “wholly foreign-owned enterprise” to offer its services to institutions and wealthy individuals in the world’s largest nation. The news comes on the heels of China’s steep stock market decline, which touched off a global stock sell-off in late August, as investors worried about slower growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Fidelity Worldwide, a separate company from the Boston-based organization but chaired by Abigail Johnson, has operated in China for more than 15 years and has 350 employees in Dalian, Shanghai, and Beijing. But Z-Ben Advisors, a research firm in Shanghai, said in a note to clients Monday that Fidelity’s new status marked a significant shift in opening China’s market to outsiders. “Fidelity’s move should be a clear signpost for global managers,” Z-Ben Advisors wrote. “The industry isn’t changing; it has already changed.” Fidelity Worldwide announced the approval of its new status last week, but it received little notice in the US press until now. The firm manages 290 billion globally and is owned by management and members of the Johnson family. Abigail Johnson chairs Fidelity Worldwide, which is a separate company from the Boston-based Fidelity Investments. Brian Conroy, president for financial services at Fidelity Worldwide, in a press release called the new status “another important step to deepen our presence in this important market.” Anthony Skriba, an executive in New York for Z-Ben Advisors, said other types of companies, like car makers, have long been able to set up in China with a wholly foreign-owned enterprise designation. But it has been difficult for investment firms to obtain them. Skriba said there’s a large opportunity in China even with the recent market turmoil. He said the incentive is greater now for Chinese investors to diversify their holdings outside of China. Fidelity’s license is the first step in enabling the firm to market its services directly to institutions like pension funds and insurance companies, as well as to wealthy individual investors. Most Western firms have done investment business in China primarily through joint ventures with Chinese firms, Skriba said. Even with its new license, Fidelity will probably still have to work with local firms to trade and manage money, but it can market directly to Chinese clients and earn a larger portion of the shared fees the clients pay. Two weeks ago, UK-based Aberdeen Asset Management received the wholly foreign-owned enterprise designation, according to Z-Ben, and Fidelity quickly followed. The firms are “the first to have done so publicly and with approval of the Chinese regulators,’’ Skriba said. “If they do it right,” Skriba said, “there should be a large opportunity.” Fidelity Worldwide already has received permission from the Chinese government to manage 1.2 billion in Chinese equities for clients in other parts of the world, making it one of the largest foreign managers, rivaling New York’s BlackRock Inc. BlackRock holds a Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership license in China, which allows it to raise money from Chinese investors to invest offshore in hedge funds. Fidelity’s Conroy said the firm’s researchers believe the Chinese economy is “slowing down and not melting down.” He also said, “We continue to believe in China’s longer term investment story. A slowing growth rate is absolutely natural and to be expected for an economy the size of China’s that’s undergoing significant transition.” The US-based Fidelity Investments operation separately employees 500 people in Dalian, China, most of them in systems and technology jobs. An earlier version of this story misspelled the last name of Anthony Skriba.

The movies is great without a big try. You cannot claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical. It's a real story and it is happening in Greek rural areas in places forgotten from God. The movie is like a punch in the stomach and I would really wish that things are not like this. It obviously talks about the xenophobia of the Greek people (the ignorance)to anything different. The problem of this guy is not that he is an ex-convicted. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want them (that's why all the good things he is doing turn boomerang to him). And also speaks about the apathy of the people, because there are some people who are against the hunting of the King, but they do not dare to say their opinion. In the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and trying to act like God says, but at the same time acting so unfairly to the King. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system. In the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them. If you want to remain different and even alone, you are lost (and it is not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for everybody. No comment for the main actor because he is already given an award and I believe that his play was great. Small comment for Hatzisavvas (plays the policeman), he is like a dinosaur, he has played a lot of roles and I'm sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that you cannot deny him a big bravo.

Veronica, already predisposed to dislike her new daughter-in-law, is further disappointed to find that she, like Jim, speaks fluent French. Larita also meets John's former girlfriend and neighbour Sarah Hurst, who is gracious about the marriage. Larita makes some inadvertent gaffes, accidentally killing the family chihuahua and giving some joking advice to Hilda that unfortunately results in embarrassment to, and enmity from, the sisters. Sarah comes to the Whittakers' parties, and to play tennis, accompanied by her brother Philip, on whom Hilda has a crush. Philip, however, is infatuated with Larita, which further angers Hilda. Larita reveals she has been previously married and remains calm in the face of her mother-in-law's disdain. To Larita's disappointment, John is not eager to leave the estate so that they can find a home of their own. Larita is bored and miserable in the countryside and hates blood sports like hunting, and any of the entertainment that country English people seem to enjoy. She reads Lady Chatterley's Lover, shocking the female relatives, and she will not play tennis.

Given the question: Information: - The Kingdom of the East Angles, today known as the Kingdom of East Anglia, was a small independent kingdom of the Angles comprising what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Fens. The kingdom formed in the 6th century in the wake of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. It was ruled by the Wuffingas in the 7th and 8th centuries, but fell to Mercia in 794, and was conquered by the Danes in 869, forming part of the Danelaw. It was conquered by Edward the Elder and incorporated into the Kingdom of England in 918. - King's Lynn , known until 1537 as Bishop's Lynn, is a seaport and market town in Norfolk, England, north of London and west of Norwich. The population of the town is 42,800. - Norfolk is a county in East Anglia in England. It borders Lincolnshire to the west and north-west, Cambridgeshire to the west and southwest, and Suffolk to the south.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I want to know how to stimulate a man's hunter instinct of chasing me. How do I calculate the center of mass of a semi sphere? Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPTIONS: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"A. No The two questions you have asked are different in terms of their nature and context. The first question focuses on human psychology and relationships, while the second question involves principles in physics. I will provide a detailed answer to both questions separately. Question 1: How to stimulate a man's hunter instinct of chasing me? To stimulate a man's hunter instinct, you can utilize some strategies that tap into their competitive and pursuing nature. Here are some ways you can achieve this: 1. Be confident and show self-worth: Being confident and showing your independence can make you more attractive and alluring. It encourages the man to chase you as they see that you are a strong and valuable person. 2. Play hard to get: Don't be too available or always respond immediately to messages. Giving the impression that you have options, interests, and a busy life will make them work harder to chase you and spend time with you. 3. Create a sense of mystery: Don't reveal everything about yourself too soon. Maintain a sense of intrigue by saving some personal information and experiences for future conversations. This will make them more curious and eager to chase you. 4. Flirt and show genuine interest: Show your interest through light flirting and compliments while still keeping things playful. Giving a subtle hint that you are attracted to them will make them want to pursue you more. 5. Build an emotional connection: Share your feelings, vulnerabilities, and be empathetic to their situation. This will create a stronger bond, prompting them to chase you in hopes of deepening their connection with you. Question 2: How do I calculate the center of mass of a semi-sphere? The center of mass for a symmetrical object is typically located at its geometric center. A semi-sphere is essentially half a sphere, and its geometric center can be determined using the following steps: Let's first recall the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr³ where \\"V\\" is the volume and \\"r\\" is the radius of the sphere. Now, we will divide the volume by 2 to obtain the volume of the semi-sphere: V_semi-sphere = (1/2) × (4/3)πr³ = (2/3)πr³ To find the center of mass, we need to calculate the moment of inertia for the semi-sphere concerning its flat base. Moment of Inertia (I) = (8πr^5)/15 Next, we use the Parallel Axis Theorem to find the moment of inertia about an axis that passes through the center of mass of the semi-sphere, parallel to the base. The theorem states: I_cm = I - MV² where \\"I_cm\\" is the moment of inertia concerning the center of mass, \\"M\\" is the mass of the semi-sphere, and \\"V\\" is the distance from the center of mass to the axis of rotation. We are interested in this distance \\"V\\", which corresponds to the height of the center of mass above the base. Rearrange the formula for V: V² = (I - I_cm) / M Since we're working with a semi-sphere, the mass can be written as M = (V_semi-sphere × density). The center of mass's height in terms of the sphere's radius is given by: V² = (8r^4)/(15M) - (2r²)/(5M) Canceling out M and simplifying the expression, we have: V = (3r)/(5) Hence, the center of mass (V) of a semi-sphere is located at a height (3r)/5 above the flat base, where r is the radius of the semi-sphere."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A). bowl was unprotected in the luggage.. B). vase was unprotected in the luggage.. Answer:","completion":"The bowl cracked but the vase was fine, because the bowl was unprotected in the luggage, leaving it more susceptible to damage during transit. It was an unfortunate oversight during the packing process that led to this unfortunate outcome, as both items had sentimental value to their owner. The vase, on the other hand, had been carefully wrapped in bubble wrap and cushioned with soft towels before being placed in a separate, more secure compartment of the suitcase, ensuring its safety throughout the journey. This situation serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of properly protecting items, especially fragile ones, when traveling. Proper packing can mean the difference between a cherished memento arriving intact, or in heartbreaking pieces. It is crucial to invest time and effort in ensuring that valuable belongings are securely packed to minimize the risk of breakages during travel. In the future, it would be wise for the owner to take a few precautions to ensure that their belongings, whether a bowl, a vase or any fragile item, are adequately protected during transport. Some steps they can follow include: 1. Investing in quality luggage: A sturdy suitcase with strong, reinforced sides and ample padding can go a long way in safeguarding fragile items during travel. It is, therefore, best to avoid flimsy or low-quality luggage, and opt for a more robust and durable option. 2. Using the appropriate packing materials: Bubble wrap, foam pellets, and packing paper can serve as excellent cushioning for fragile belongings. It is essential to wrap each item individually and fill any empty spaces within the suitcase or box to minimize movement during transit. 3. Packing items securely: When packing fragile items, it is crucial to ensure they are snugly fitted within the luggage. This means they should not be packed too loosely, or too tightly, as both scenarios can result in damage. Additionally, heavier items should be placed at the bottom of the luggage, while lighter, and more fragile ones, reside on top to prevent unnecessary pressure being applied. 4. Labeling the luggage: Attach a ‘Fragile’ or ‘Handle with Care’ label on the luggage to inform handlers of the delicate items inside, hopefully encouraging greater care during transit. 5. Considering insurance: If the items being transported are of high monetary or sentimental value, it may be worth considering investing in travel insurance that covers their loss or damage. While it cannot replace a damaged item, it can help ease the financial burden should something go wrong during the trip. By taking these precautions and learning from the unfortunate incident with the cracked bowl, the owner can take solace in knowing that any future trips involving fragile belongings will be far less likely to result in disappointment and heartache. The vase, luckily spared from harm, serves as a tangible reminder of the importance of proper packing and protection during travel, and the wisdom in taking extra care to ensure the safe passage of cherished belongings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938). - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk. - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188.

Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Answer:","completion":"Based on the kinetic-molecular theory, Team A, which heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, had a higher likelihood of their can exploding. The kinetic-molecular theory explains the behavior of gases in terms of the motion of their particles. In this case, as the can of soup heats up over the fire, the kinetic energy of the air molecules inside the can increases due to the heat coming from the campfire. This energy transfer causes the air molecules to move faster and collide with the container walls more often and with increased force. Consequently, the pressure inside the unvented can rises. As the soup inside Team A's unvented can continues to heat, it may reach its boiling point, causing it to change from a liquid state to a gaseous one. This process of boiling leads to the production of more gas, further amplifying the pressure within the can. Ultimately, the increasing pressure may surpass the can's structural strength, causing it to explode. On the other hand, Team B vented their can of soup before heating it over the fire. By doing so, they allowed the air pressure inside the can to equalize with the external atmospheric pressure. This venting process not only enabled the heated air molecules to escape but also prevented pressure from building up inside the can to dangerous levels. As a result, the likelihood of Team B's can exploding decreased significantly. In conclusion, understanding the kinetic-molecular theory helps us to discern that Team A, who heated an unvented can of soup, faced a greater risk of experiencing an explosion, due to the increased air pressure and kinetic energy of the molecules inside the can."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this article and answer this question Vest Recklinghausen was first mentioned in 1228 as a fiefdom of the Archbishopric of Cologne and thus it belonged to the Electoral Rhenish Circle. The administrator lived in castle Westerholt, located in Herten. From 1446 to 1576 it was used as collateral, first pawned to the lords of Gemen and after 1492 to the Lords of Schauenburg and Holstein-Pinneberg, who pawned the territory back to the Archbishops of Cologne in 1576. During the Cologne War , Vest Recklinghausen was occupied and sacked several times by troops from both sides of the conflict. In 1583, although much of the territory was already Protestant, the Calvinist Elector of Cologne, Gebhard, Truchsess von Waldburg and his wife, Agnes, ordered the destruction of the icons and decorative elements of the churches. In 1584, the territory was sacked again, this time by the competing archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria. In 1586, the territory was invaded by Martin Schenck and Hermann Cloedt, who caused great damage to the farms and small villages, and were besieged by Claude de Berlaymont, also known as Haultpenne, in the city of Werl. How many years passed between the pawning of the castle to Archbishops of Cologne and the territory being invaded by Martin Schenck?","completion":"Let's break it down step by step! The castle was pawned to the Archbishops of Cologne in the year 1576. Then, Martin Schenck invaded the territory in the year 1586. To find out how many years passed between these two events, we need to subtract 1576 from 1586. So, 1586 - 1576 = 10. There you go! 10 years passed between the pawning of the castle to the Archbishops of Cologne and the territory being invaded by Martin Schenck."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - Hesse or Hessia (, Hessian dialect: \\"Hesse\\" ) is a federal state (\\"Land\\") of the Federal Republic of Germany, with just over six million inhabitants. The state capital is Wiesbaden; the largest city is Frankfurt am Main. Until the formation of the German Reich in 1871, Hesse was an independent country ruled by a Grand Duke (Grand Duchy of Hesse). Due to divisions after World War II, the modern federal state does not cover the entire cultural region of Hesse which includes both the State of Hesse and the area known as Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate. - The Order of the Polar Star (Swedish: \\"Nordstjärneorden\\") is a Swedish order of chivalry created by King Frederick I on 23 February 1748, together with the Order of the Sword and the Order of the Seraphim. - Riksdag of the Estates (formally: ; informally: ) was the name used for the Estates of Sweden when they were assembled. Until its dissolution in 1866, the institution was the highest authority in Sweden next to the king. It was a Diet made up of the Four Estates, which historically were the lines of division in Swedish society: - The Order of the Sword ( Officially Royal Order of the Sword Swedish Kungliga Svärdsorden ) is a Swedish order of chivalry created by King Frederick I of Sweden on February 23 , 1748 , together with the Order of the Seraphim and the Order of the Polar Star . Awarded to officers , and originally intended as an award for bravery and particularly long or useful service , it eventually became a more or less obligatory award for military officers after a certain number of years in service . There were originally three grades , Knight , Commander and Commander Grand Cross , but these were later multiplied by division into classes . The motto of the order is in Latin : Pro Patria which means For Fatherland . - A chivalric order, order of chivalry, order of knighthood or equestrian order is an order, confraternity or society of knights typically founded during or in inspiration of the original Catholic military orders of the Crusades (circa 1099-1291), paired with medieval concepts of ideals of chivalry. - The Great Northern War (170021) was a conflict in which a coalition led by the Tsardom of Russia successfully contested the supremacy of the Swedish Empire in Central, Northern, and Eastern Europe. The initial leaders of the anti-Swedish alliance were Peter the Great of Russia, Frederick IV of DenmarkNorway and Augustus II the Strong of Saxony-Poland. Frederick IV and Augustus II were forced out of the alliance in 1700 and 1706 respectively, but rejoined it in 1709. George I of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover) joined the coalition in 1714 for Hanover and in 1717 for Britain, and Frederick William I of Brandenburg-Prussia joined it in 1715. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Frederick I, , (28 April 1676 5 April 1751) was prince consort of Sweden from 1718 to 1720, and King of Sweden from 1720 until his death and (as \\"Frederick I\\") also Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel from 1730. He ascended the throne following the death of his brother-in-law, absolutist Charles XII in the Great Northern War, as his sister and heir Ulrika Eleonora preferred to abdicate from her position as queen regnant after relinquishing most powers to the Riksdag of the Estates. His powerless reign saw his family's elimination from the line of succession after the parliamentary government dominated by pro-revanchist Hat Party politicians ventured into a war with Russia, which ended in defeat and the Russian tsarina Elizabeth demanding Adolph Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp to be instated following the death of the king. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. I am facing a new situation today: Two farms had different plant cultivation methods. Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which farm caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understanding the two types of farms - Jolly farm adopted permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer. Permaculture is a sustainable farming practice that focuses on using local resources, minimizing waste, and promoting biodiversity. It often avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. - Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides, which are conventional agricultural practices that rely on synthetic inputs to maintain crop yields. Step 2: Analyzing the impact of different farming methods on fertilizer runoff - Permaculture practices at Jolly farm likely limit the use of synthetic fertilizers, reducing the potential for fertilizer runoff. - Peach farm uses fertilizers and pesticides, which can contribute to fertilizer runoff when rain dissolves it in the soil and carries it away. Step 3: Connecting the farming methods to ocean pollution - The background article states that runoff carrying fertilizer into bodies of water, including oceans, can cause excessive growth of algae and lead to the formation of dead zones. - Therefore, farming practices that contribute less to fertilizer runoff will be less likely to cause ocean pollution. Step 4: Comparing Jolly farm and Peach farm based on their farming methods - Jolly farm adopted Sepp Holzer's permaculture methods, which are more sustainable and are less likely to cause fertilizer runoff. - Peach farm's use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides increases the potential for fertilizer runoff, elevating the risk of ocean pollution. Answer: Jolly farm, which adopted Sepp Holzer's permaculture methods, caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans as compared to Peach farm, which continued using fertilizers and pesticides. The sustainable practices employed at Jolly farm contribute to reduced fertilizer runoff and consequently lower the risk of ocean pollution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As any homemaker who has tried to keep order at the dinner table knows, there is far more to a family meal than food. Sociologist Michael Lewis has been studying 50 families to find out just how much more. Lewis and his co-worker carried out their study by videotaping the families while they are having ordinary meals in their own homes. They found that parents with small families talk actively with each other and their children. But as the number of children gets larger,conversation gives way to the parents' efforts to control the loud noise they make. That can have an important effect on the children. \\"In general the more question-asking the parents do, the higher the children's IQ scores,\\"Lewis says. \\" And the more children there are, the less question-asking there is. \\" The study also provides an explanation for why middle children often seem to have a harder time in life than their siblings . Lewis found that in families with three or four children, dinner conversation is likely to center on the oldest child, who has the most to talk about, and the youngest, who needs the most attention. \\" _ \\"says Lewis.

In 1898 he was elected to the Congress as Liberal candidate and was appointed Professor of Roman Law at the University of Oviedo. In 1899, he turned into Republican and in 1906 he was elected Republican congressman. He was one of the organizers of the Liberal Block in 1908 against the Conservative Prime Minister Antonio Maura and of the Republican-Socialist Conjunction in 1909. In 1912, he founded with Gumersindo de Azcárate and José Ortega y Gasset the Reformist Party and the League for the Spanish Political Education.

McDonough?\\" Context: \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The defendant in Hill v.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Aboard a commercial airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy (Michael Jeter) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness.

Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which...

I got the name of an insurance agent from a friend and called the agent to get some information. From the kinds of questions I put to him the agent could tell that I knew nothing about insurance, so he kindly offered to explore the matter with me in more detail---to help me determine the kind of policy I ought to be considering. That evening he appeared at my door promptly at 7:30; without wasting time on pleasantness, he spread his papers out on the kitchen table and launched into a lengthy explanation. I listened attentively as he talked about the difference between various types of policies, and he explained the kind of coverage he felt I ought to have. Toward the end of the evening (after three or four hours of talking), he kindly helped me fill out an application for a 50,000 policy, and then he asked if I could go to a Dr. Luther's office on Friday for a physical examination. I don't know why, but it was not until the mention of the doctor's appointment that I realized fully what was happening. I was about to sign a lifetime contract, yet I had not really made a decision about whether I wanted to buy the policy. However, since he had spent so much time with me, I didn't want to make him feel that he had wasted his time.

Please answer the following question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Who should break weight loss down into long term goals? - not enough information - The author. - The Mayo Clinic. - A dieter. Answer:","completion":"A dieter should break weight loss down into long-term goals. The reason for this is that weight loss is a personal and highly individual journey. Therefore, the person embarking on this journey - the dieter - needs to set and manage these goals according to their specific needs, capabilities, and circumstances. Weight loss requires commitment, discipline, and lifestyle changes. This starts with the dieter recognising the need to lose weight for health or personal reasons and deciding to take action towards that. Once this decision is made, the dieter, with or without the help of a dietitian or a doctor, is the one that sets the long-term weight loss goal. However, as stated in the question, setting the goal is often easier than achieving it. This is where breaking down the long-term goal into smaller, more manageable weekly goals comes into play. This can make the task appear less daunting, increase motivation, and provide more opportunities for celebrating successes along the way. For instance, a dieter might have a long-term goal of losing 40 pounds. Nonetheless, aiming to lose this amount all at once or in a very short time can be overwhelming and potentially detrimental to the dieter's physical and mental health. By breaking this goal down to losing 1-2 pounds a week (a guideline recommended by health institutions such as the Mayo Clinic), the dieter can more easily track their progress and stay motivated. Setting realistic week-by-week targets can provide the dieter with a clear path to follow, making the goal of weight loss feel more achievable. If the dieter fails to hit their weekly target, they are encouraged to examine the reasons behind this and adjust their plan accordingly. This flexibility can be crucial in maintaining motivation and adherence to a weight loss program. In summary, although dietitians, trainers, or health care providers can provide guidance, it is ultimately the dieter who should break their weight loss goal down into achievable long-term targets. This personalised approach allows the dieter to remain in control of their journey, ensuring they stay motivated and committed to their goal. This approach is also more adaptable, allowing for adjustments and modifications based on the dieter's progress."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given an amazon food product review and its polarity (positive or negative).

Anton Yelchin, \\"Star Trek\\" actor who plays Chekov, dead at 27 after car crash Last Updated Jun 19, 2016 12:40 PM EDT LOS ANGELES -- Anton Yelchin, a charismatic and rising actor best known for playing Chekov in the new \\"Star Trek\\" films, has died at the age of 27. He was killed in a fatal traffic collision early Sunday morning, his publicist, Jennifer Allen confirmed. Yelchin, 27, was struck by his own car as it rolled backward down his driveway in Studio City, according to Los Angeles police Officer Jenny Hosier. The car pinned Yelchin against a brick mailbox pillar and a security fence. He had gotten out of the vehicle momentarily, but police did not say why he was behind it when it started rolling. He was on his way to meet friends for a rehearsal, Hosier said. When he didn't show up, the group came to his home and found him dead. An LAPD spokesperson told CBS News that foul play is not expected. Yelchin began acting as a child, taking small roles in independent films and various television shows, such as \\"ER,\\" ''The Practice,\\" and \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\\" His breakout big-screen role came opposite Anthony Hopkins in 2001's \\"Hearts in Atlantis.\\" Yelchin, an only child, was born in Russia. His parents were professional figure skaters who moved the family to the United States when Yelchin was a baby. He briefly flirted with skating lessons, too, before discovering that he wasn't very skilled on the ice. That led him to acting class. \\"I loved the improvisation part of it the most, because it was a lot like just playing around with stuff. There was something about it that I just felt completely comfortable doing and happy doing,\\" Yelchin told The Associated Press in 2011 while promoting the romantic drama \\"Like Crazy.\\" He starred opposite Felicity Jones. \\"(My father) still wanted me to apply to college and stuff, and I did,\\" Yelchin said. \\"But this is what I wanted.\\" His biggest role to date has been in the rebooted \\"Star Trek\\" films as the heavily accented navigator Chekov, for which he was able to draw on his Russian roots. The third film in the series, \\"Star Trek Beyond,\\" comes out in July. \\"What's great about him is he can do anything. He's a chameleon. He can do bigger movies or smaller, more intimate ones,\\" ''Like Crazy\\" director Drake Doremus told the AP in 2011. \\"There are a lot of people who can't, who can only do one or the other. ...

Enforcement and Redress Mechanisms: The EU has established enforcement and redress mechanisms to ensure consumer rights are respected and upheld. The European Consumer Centre (ECC) network provides guidance and support to consumers who face issues with cross-border transactions. Additionally, the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform helps facilitate dispute resolution between consumers and businesses in cases of online transactions. 6.

Plot title: Boarding Gate Movie plot: Paris[edit] After discussing his plans for retiring by selling on the shares in his security company to his debtors with his partner, AndrÃ©, aging underworld entrepreneur Miles Rennberg is paid a surprise visit at his Paris office by aggressive underworld moll Sandra. Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationshipâa nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills. She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment. Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong. Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa. Acting as her driver and lookout, Lisa escorts Sandra to the site of a drug deal that quickly goes sour when her buyer is revealed to be a Narcotics officer. Suspicious after Sandra's cool response to his earlier queries about a missing container in a recent shipment, Lester follows Sandra to the deal and accosts Lisa as she waits in the car.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Google Splits Google Plus Photos Into Separate Service Say goodbye to Google Plus as you know it. The search giant confirmed Monday that the social network’s highly-regarded photo app is getting split off from the rest of the service, which will now be called “Streams.” Google VP of Product Bradley Horowitz will head both Google Photos and Streams, he wrote in a Google Plus post: “It’s important to me that these changes are properly understood to be positive improvements to both our products and how they reach users.” Neither rebranded product’s name references Google’s social network in any way, The Verge points out. That could signal Google Plus is quietly being dismantled after failing to ever truly take off. While there are more than 2 billion Google Plus profiles, that’s mostly a result of Google’s efforts to turn Plus into a sign-in service for other Google products — Business Insider reported in January that just 9% of Google Plus users post public content. Google SVP of Product Sundar Pichai said at a Mobile World Congress event Monday that Google chat app Hangouts will remain a standalone product. “For us Google Plus was always two big things: one was building a stream, the second was a social layer, a common layer of identity; how sharing works across our products and services.” Pichai said. Pichai also confirmed Google’s ambitious plans to launch a mobile network that combines cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, called “Project Nova.”","completion":"Google has decided to split its Google Plus Photos into a separate service, now called \\"Streams.\\" This marks a significant change in Google's social network, as Google Plus was never able to gain the popularity that was expected.

It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

The 'Compass Rose' is a ship prominent in which 20th century novel?","completion":"The 'Compass Rose' is a ship prominent in the 20th century novel 'The Cruel Sea' by Nicholas Monsarrat. The novel was first published in 1951 and is widely regarded as a classic in British literature. It tells the story of the crew of the British ship HMS Compass Rose during World War II, primarily focusing on naval warfare in the Atlantic Ocean against German U-boats. 'The Cruel Sea' is esteemed for its realistic portrayal of the lives of the Royal Navy officers and personnel who put themselves in grave danger to protect the Atlantic convoys, ensuring the vital supply line between North America and the United Kingdom was upheld. The story trails the experiences of several characters onboard the Compass Rose, depicting them as they develop and grow through the challenges of war and their personal lives. These individuals include Lieutenant Commander George Ericson, a competent and compassionate leader; Sub-Lieutenant Lockhart, an inexperienced but ambitious reserve officer; and the other crew members, each with their own stories and struggles. The novel's title evokes the harsh, unpredictable nature of the ocean itself, symbolizing the threat posed not only by the enemy U-boats but also by the unforgiving environment the sailors must endure. Throughout the novel, Monsarrat captures the crew's resilience, bravery, and camaraderie while also highlighting the psychological toll their dangerous mission takes on them. The author draws from his own wartime experiences, having served as a naval officer in the British Royal Naval Reserve (RNVR) during World War II. This lends a sense of authenticity and added depth to the story. The 'Compass Rose' serves as the primary setting and focal point of the novel, and while it is a fictional ship, it represents the very real challenges faced by the men and women who served onboard corvettes and other vessels tasked with defending convoys during the pivotal conflict of the 20th century. In conclusion, 'The Cruel Sea' revolves around the ship 'Compass Rose' and provides an intense, realistic portrayal of naval warfare and the experiences of the characters serving in the Royal Navy during World War II. The novel has left an indelible mark on British literature and remains a significant work that illustrates the bravery and steadfastness of the men and women who contributed to the victory over an aggressive enemy while confronting the merciless forces of nature at sea."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone, Brian DePalma, Al Pacino, and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable, trite, and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. This movie represents the worst of Hollywood. What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake, and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly, the acting is terrible. Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly, the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself. You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next, each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks. So I am going to ask, Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. But at least a drama series has some kind of focus. Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together.

If mating is generally preceded by flirting in a modern relationship, then what is generally preceded by flirting in a modern relationship? Answer choices: - PDAs - ligt - Decibels - firm hugs - friction - heat - autumn - mating","completion":"Flirting, as a social behavior, plays a significant role in the development of a modern relationship. It helps in creating a connection, gauging mutual interest, and setting the stage for emotional and physical intimacy. Generally, flirting precedes mating, but multiple other aspects are involved in a modern relationship, which goes beyond simply physical contact. In the context of a modern relationship, flirting often leads to: 1. Emotional connection: Flirting contributes to the establishment of an emotional bond between both individuals, fostering trust and closeness that form the foundation of a relationship. This emotional connection helps to create a sense of security and attachment, vital for the relationship's growth and sustenance. 2. Effective communication: Flirting, typically consisting of playful banter and teasing, helps in developing communication skills between partners. This communiqué facilitates the sharing of thoughts, emotions, and experiences, which contribute to better understanding and empathy within the relationship. 3. Building attraction: Flirting contributes to the sense of attraction and interest shared between partners. This builds romantic and sexual tension, which can often lead the way to further physical or emotional intimacy. Given these factors, flirting in a modern relationship generally precedes a combination of emotional connection, effective communication, building attraction, and eventually, intimate physical contact. As physical intimacy is not the sole component of a healthy relationship, it's essential to understand and nurture the emotional and intellectual aspects associated with flirting as well."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 1979 Fastnet race ended in tragedy after a freak storm hit competitors. In all 15 people died and the ex-British leader Edward Heath went missing for a time. The disaster resulted in a raft of new safety rules introduced into the sport. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The 1979 Fastnet Disaster: A Turning Point for Sailing Safety Regulations Introduction: In August 1979, the sailing community faced one of its greatest tragedies during the Fastnet race, a prestigious offshore sailing competition that spans over 600 nautical miles in the North Atlantic. A freak storm hit the competitors, resulting in the loss of 15 lives and the temporary disappearance of the former British leader, Edward Heath. This tragedy led to a significant overhaul of safety rules and regulations in the sport that continue to influence sailing to this day. Step 1: Detailing the Event The 1979 Fastnet race started from Cowes on the Isle of Wight, proceeding to the Fastnet Rock off the southwest coast of Ireland, and culminating at Plymouth, England. With clear skies and a moderate wind, the race began with 303 yachts and their skilled sailors eager to conquer this nautical challenge. Little did they know that disaster was looming. Step 2: The Freak Storm Midway through the race, the calm weather drastically changed as a freak storm struck the fleet. A severe low-pressure system developed over the Atlantic, producing violent winds of up to 100 mph and waves as high as 50 feet that quickly overwhelmed the competitors. The storm wreaked havoc on the yachts, causing capsizes, broken masts, and shattered hulls. Step 3: The Tragic Outcome As the storm raged on, 15 sailors tragically lost their lives amidst the chaos. Former British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, who was also participating in the race on board his yacht Morning Cloud, found himself challenged to remain afloat and went missing for some time before eventually being located and rescued. By the end of the race, only 86 of the 303 yachts that started managed to cross the finish line, with many others either abandoned or having sought refuge in nearby ports. Step 4: A Wake-Up Call for the Sailing Community The 1979 Fastnet disaster served as a stark reminder of the dangers of offshore racing and prompted the sailing community to reassess safety rules and regulations. The Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC), organizers of the Fastnet race, commissioned an official inquiry into the incident to identify areas where improvements could be made. Step 5: Introduction of New Safety Rules Following the tragedy, a raft of new safety rules was introduced to mitigate the risks associated with future sailing events. These included revisions to yacht design and construction standards, mandatory safety equipment for all participants, and the implementation of rigorous safety training for sailors. The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) was also created, offering improved communication and coordination for emergencies at sea. Conclusion: The 1979 Fastnet disaster will forever be remembered as a dark turning point in the history of sailing. The loss of 15 lives was a heavy toll, but it led to an unwavering commitment to safety within the sailing community. As a result of this tragedy, the advancements in safety rules and regulations have made the sport safer for all who dare to challenge the sea. Today, sailors worldwide continue to take part in the Fastnet race and other offshore competitions, emboldened by the knowledge that the risks they face are better understood and managed than ever before."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Summarize this article: Stable paper airplanes fly farther and faster. Paper airplanes typically benefit from adding what’s known as up elevator. Take the back end of the airplane, which on a standard dart-shaped plane is the wing tips, and use your finger to bend them upwards a little. This counterbalances the weight in the nose of your plane. Most planes also benefit from a little weight in the nose. This helps balance the plane so it doesn’t have a tendency to fly straight up. Cover the nose in a layer or two of tape or add a paper clip. Test out out the plane and make adjustments as necessary. Most airplanes are better off being slightly nose heavy rather than slightly tail heavy. Heavier planes are better at withstanding outdoor flight. Bending the wing tips downwards is only useful for planes that try to fly upwards when launched. Use your fingers to bend them down slightly. Try throwing the plane again. If this isn’t enough to balance it, you can try adding more weight to the nose of the plane. Slightly bend the end of the tail to the left. If your tail has two sides, bend the left side up and the right side down. When the air hits the bends, the plane will change the plane’s direction. If your plane has a single, vertical edge for a tail, bend it to the right. Otherwise, pull the right side up and the left side down. These bends will correct the airflow to cause a more stable flight.","completion":"This article talks about making paper airplanes fly better. To do this, you need to bend the back part of the airplane a little bit upwards, add some weight to the front, and make some adjustments. This helps the airplane fly straight and smoothly. If the airplane tries to fly up too much, you can bend the wings down a bit and add more weight at the front. You can also make the airplane turn by changing the shape of the tail. Making these changes can help your paper airplane fly farther, faster, and more stable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more total yards did Riggins have compared to Brown?","completion":"Without specifying the full names and detailing the sports or games these individuals are associated with, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive comparison. However, assuming you're referring to two of the most well-known figures in American football history, John Riggins and Jim Brown, I can pull together a comparison based entirely on data available from their professional careers in the National Football League (NFL). John Riggins, a professional American football running back, was born in 1949 and had a career spanning from 1971 to 1985. Known as \\"The Diesel,\\" Riggins had a successful career playing for the New York Jets and the Washington Redskins in the National Football League (NFL). On the other hand, Jim Brown, widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time, was an American professional football player and actor. Brown was a running back for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) from 1957 through 1965. According to statistics provided by the NFL, John Riggins ran for 11,352 yards in total over his 14-season career. His career total includes both his time spent with the New York Jets and the Washington Redskins. Jim Brown, however, despite having a shorter career of only 9 years compared to Riggins' 14 years, rushed for a staggering 12,312 yards. So, based on these yardage statistics alone, it is clear that despite Riggins having a longer playing career, Jim Brown was able to amass more total rushing yards. To quantify the difference: 12,312 yards (Brown's total) subtracted by 11,352 yards (Riggins' total) equals 960 yards. Therefore, Jim Brown had 960 more total yards than John Riggins in their NFL careers. This comparison is a testament to Jim Brown's extraordinary ability as a running back, compounded by the fact that he accomplished this feat in less time than it took Riggins. Of course, comparing players from different eras and different teams is always a challenge due to the varied style of plays, varied competition, and team dynamics of their respective time periods. Conclusively, while John Riggins had an impressive NFL career, the total yards achieved by Jim Brown outstrip Riggins by 960 yards, making Brown's career one of the most outstanding in American Football history. Remember that the measure of a player's skill and contribution to the game extends beyond just total yards; factors like touchdowns, passes, leadership, and their ability to work within a team are also crucial. Both Riggins and Brown are remembered for their tenacity, skill, and significant contributions to the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The fluid ounce is distinct from the ounce as a unit of weight or mass, although it is sometimes referred to simply as an \`\`ounce'' where context makes the meaning clear, such as ounces in a bottle. Is the following statement correct based on the text is an oz the same as a fluid oz","completion":"The statement \\"is an oz the same as a fluid oz\\" is not entirely correct based on the provided text. Although both terms can sometimes be used interchangeably, it is important to differentiate between the fluid ounce (fl oz) and the ounce (oz) as they represent different measurement units and are used for varying purposes. A fluid ounce (fl oz) is a unit of volume used in the measurement of liquid substances. It is primarily applied in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. In the United States, one fluid ounce is equivalent to approximately 29.57 milliliters (ml), whereas, in the Imperial system used in the UK, one fluid ounce equals around 28.41 milliliters. This unit is often employed in recipes and labeling of beverages, food products, and pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, an ounce (oz) is a unit of weight or mass commonly used to measure solid substances. The ounce is also widely utilized in various systems, notably avoirdupois, troy, and apothecaries' systems. The avoirdupois ounce, which is the most prevalent, is equivalent to around 28.35 grams (g). While this unit is primarily associated with the United States, it is prevalent in other countries too, including Canada, the UK, and Australia. In summary, the fluid ounce and the ounce are distinct units with different applications and should not be considered the same. While fluid ounces measure the volume of liquid substances, ounces represent the weight or mass of solid materials. Context often helps to clarify the intended meaning in casual conversations or when both terms are used interchangeably. However, it is crucial to establish the distinction between them in order to avoid confusion, especially when dealing with precise measurements."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kobayashi's plane malfunctions and is forced to land near Iwato Island, an uninhabited strip of rocks formed by volcanic eruptions. Tsukioka then looks for Kobayashi and finds him safe, with only a wrist sprain. While talking, the two men hear some strange sounds and find two monsters fighting. Tsukioka immediately recognizes one of the monsters to be Godzilla. The two monsters then fall off a cliff, into the ocean. Tsukioka and Kobayashi report to the authorities in Osaka, and find out that the other monster Godzilla was fighting is Anguirus. A group of scientists with the two pilots research Anguirus in a book written by a Polish scientist. Godzilla and Anguirus lived around the same time millions of years ago, and there was an intense rivalry between the two monsters. Archaeologist Kyohei Yamane, who experienced Godzilla's attack in 1954, is also present at the meeting, and shows a film (composed of clips from the 1954 film) of the original Godzilla attacking Tokyo. He confirms that this Godzilla is a second member of the same species, and that it and Anguirus were probably brought back to life by the same hydrogen bomb tests that awoke the original Godzilla. Yamane states that there is no way to kill Godzilla, and that Daisuke Serizawa, the inventor of the Oxygen Destroyer, had died and burned the formula. Yamane, though, suggests that the military should use flares on Godzilla to attract the monster away from the shore as Godzilla becomes angry when it sees lights because the hydrogen bomb's bright explosion had awakened and mutated it. Godzilla arrives on the shore of Osaka. While a blackout of all city lights is enforced, JASDF jets are sent to shoot flares from their planes to lead Godzilla away from the shore. Godzilla sees the flames, and, as Yamane predicted, starts to leave. Meanwhile, a prison truck transports dangerous criminals to another part of the country. All of the...

Upon being seated at our cozy table, our server, Julie, promptly greeted us with a warm smile and presented us with the menu which featured a wide variety of mouth-watering dishes to suit every palate. Julie was knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations based on our preferences and dietary restrictions. She also suggested a superb bottle of wine, which perfectly complemented our meal. I opted for the Pumpkin Risotto as an appetizer, and it surpassed my expectations. The dish was so creamy, and the balance between the savory Parmesan and the hint of sweetness from the pumpkin was simply perfection. My partner ordered the Crispy Calamari, which was lightly battered and cooked to golden perfection. The homemade marinara sauce that accompanied it was divine and had a nice kick to it! For our main course, I chose the Pan-Seared Scallops with a Saffron Risotto in a citrus beurre blanc sauce. The scallops were perfectly cooked – tender and succulent – and the combination of the saffron risotto with the zesty sauce was divine. My partner devoured the Filet Mignon, cooked to a spot-on medium-rare, with a rich, flavorful red wine reduction that only elevated the dish further. We couldn't resist the dessert selection and decided to share the Chocolate Lava Cake, which was nothing short of a masterpiece. Warm and gooey in the center, with a generous scoop of velvety vanilla bean ice cream on the side – it was the perfect way to conclude our incredible dining experience. The Enchanted Garden provides not only top-notch food but also excellent service with the utmost attention to detail. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a comfortable and memorable experience, even accommodating our last-minute request for a birthday surprise.

Answer A: talk with themselves – This option does not make much sense in the context as it doesn't necessarily align with Casey's introverted nature. Talking with oneself may not be a common or preferred activity for introverted individuals. Answer C: find a good home – This answer is unrelated to the context and does not give any insight into what Casey might want to do next.

Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Instructions: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"sympathetic\\" and \\"stern\\") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences.

In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY. Input: Context Word: fitness. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Create a pair of sentences with blanks about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Usage: PersonX always stays fit because of their daily _ sessions, while PersonY struggles to maintain fitness. This part fulfills the criteria as there are two blanks in a pair of sentences, one for each person. Part #2: Ensure sentences are similar, have contrasting trigger words, and unequal likelihood for PersonX and PersonY to fill the blank. Usage: PersonX always stays fit because of their daily gym sessions, while PersonY struggles to maintain fitness due to their disdain for exercise. The two sentences are similar, but have contrasting trigger words (gym and disdain), making it unlikely for PersonX and PersonY to fill the same blank. Part #3: Avoid explicit, offensive, adult content and using real people names. Usage: PersonX always stays fit because of their daily morning runs, while PersonY has trouble maintaining fitness due to their sedentary lifestyle. This meets the criteria as it does not contain offensive, explicit, adult content, or real people's names. Part #4: Diversify sentence styles and avoid simple negations. Usage: PersonX committed to fitness by following a strict workout routine, whereas PersonY's inconsistent exercise schedule led to weight fluctuations. The sentences are diverse and don't rely on simple negations to create contrast. Part #5: Maintain the word count and overlapping word limits for twin sentences. Usage: PersonX excels in their fitness goals by enjoying challenging _ sessions, whereas PersonY prefers more leisurely activities and lacks the same dedication. Both sentences have 15-30 words and share at least 70% overlapping words. Part #6: Utilize the context word \\"fitness\\" in the sentences. Usage: Due to PersonX's unwavering _ on fitness, they have impressive muscle tone, but PersonY's more casual approach hasn't yielded the same results. This part uses the context word \\"fitness\\" in both sentences. Part #7: Ensure same gender for PersonX and PersonY and their appearance order. Usage: PersonX's commitment to fitness leads them to embrace intense _ workouts, while PersonY's laid-back nature results in a less athletic physique. Both PersonX and PersonY are of the same gender, and PersonX appears earlier in the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Lemy, the cute, curly lagotto romagnolo, gave a little yelp as she snuffled among the fallen oak leaves and started scrabbling in the earth. Wielding a small pickaxe, her owner Serge took over the dig and pulled out a muddy lump. He offered his dog a sniff before holding the golf-ball-sized black truffle aloft for us all to admire. A city to be savoured: Lyon is home to two major rivers (the Rhone and Saone) - and endless good restaurants. Deep in the French countryside, this Italian breed of duck-hunting dog is prized for its fast and accurate work. 'The Ferrari of truffle hounds!' exclaimed Serge. With our lesson on the production of the valuable fungi over, we strolled back to Serge's farmhouse, where his wife Corinne passed around delicious truffle infused canapes and glasses of wine. This excursion was just one of the epicurean treats on the inaugural cruise aboard SS Catherine, christened in April by her namesake, French film star Catherine Deneuve. In the coming days, sailing on the Rhone from Lyon, France's gastronomic capital, our noses and palates would be tickled with tastings ashore and on board of artisanal chocolate, fine wines, regional cheeses and oysters too. And all this between gourmet meals. SS Catherine is the latest lavishly and lovingly decorated vessel in the Uniworld line. Good boy: Serge and his faithful hound Emy search for buried treasure in the French countryside. The ship has a wonderful extravagance about her - original art, including works by Miro and Chagal adorns the walls. She is designed with no expense spared by Beatrice Tollman, who is also the founder and president of The Red Carnation Hotel collection, and her daughter Toni. One of them is the five-star Milestone in Kensington and if you've been there, you'll recognise the eclectic style and focus on tip-top service that guests enjoy on SS Catherine. Green-themed SS Catherine has a most striking lobby, where a specially commissioned, enormous Murano glass chandelier hangs above a large glass horse standing in front of a glass lift. Beside this is a waterfall, flanked by a wrought-iron double staircase. Custom-made green glass latticework has been handcrafted on to the mirrored walls. There is a marble fireplace, in the lounge and in the corner of Bar du Leopard there is a swimming pool with a luscious jungle mural. My cabin had a marble bathroom, three ivory and green embroidered walls and a glass one that retracted at the flick of a switch to create a balcony (with another switch to draw down a fly screen for hot nights). I awoke from a dreamless sleep in my huge bed in the town of Tain l'Hermitage, with twin town Tournon on the opposite bank. Settling in nicely: The SS Catherine offers luxury suites with glorious views of the passing scenery. By half past ten I had nibbled my way round the new, interactive La Cite Du Chocolat museum, and was watching a chef demonstrate two different chocolate mousse recipes. Which we then of course consumed. Hurrying over to Tournon, we were rewarded with generous tastes of Crozes-Hermitage wines on the terrace of a chateau, enjoying views of the vineyards across the river that produced the grapes. As we walked back to the ship across France's oldest suspension bridge, waiters greeted us at intervals, proffering trays of green and white goat's-cheese macaroons. Then it was time for lunch. The lavish buffet included local charcuterie and cheeses and comfort food, such as a clear chicken soup and a creamy rice pudding made to Mrs Tollman's recipes. Teatime, with exquisite sandwiches and pastries in the Bar du Leopard, was followed by a tasting of Rhone Valley wines and Ardeche goat's cheeses in the Van Gogh lounge, before it was time for the most sumptuous dinner of classic French dishes. Next morning, to work up an appetite before a champagne breakfast, I borrowed one of the ship's bicycles for a spin round the pretty village of Viviers, then boarded the coach setting off into the countryside for truffle-hunting. The leisurely afternoon's cruise was punctuated with a master class on Arcachon oysters, flown in from Bordeaux. During my few days on board, I learned that a cruise on SS Catherine is truly a feast, and not only for the eyes.

Acquire a death certificate. Article:","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Organizing a Funeral: Key Steps to Follow Introduction Losing a loved one is a difficult and emotional period. Organizing a funeral can feel overwhelming, especially when you are trying to come to terms with your grief. This article aims to guide you through the essential steps to help you plan a funeral, making it easier for you to honor your loved one in the way they deserve. Step 1: Choose a Funeral Provider Selecting a funeral provider that is compatible with your needs and preferences is an important part of the process. It would be best to do some research on the different funeral homes available in your area. Recommendations from friends or online reviews may be helpful in making an informed decision. Consider their services offered, reputation, and pricing. Once you have chosen a funeral provider, arrange a meeting with the funeral director. Step 2: Provide the Deceased's Information The funeral director will require some information about the deceased to help with the funeral arrangements. This information may include their full name, date of birth, date of death, and the place of death. Additionally, you may need to provide the deceased's Social Security number for any legal purposes that may arise. Step 3: Decide on the Type of Funeral There are several types of funerals to choose from, such as traditional, cremation, or green burials. Discuss the preferences of the deceased and your own, as well as religious or cultural beliefs that may influence the choice. The funeral director can provide guidance on the options available and help you make a well-informed decision. Step 4: Make Arrangements for Payment Funeral costs can vary depending on the chosen services. It is essential to have a clear understanding of any financial constraints before finalizing the arrangements. Explore available options for payment, such as insurance policies, pre-paid funeral plans, or assistance from friends and family. Be sure to discuss all costs with the funeral director to avoid any unexpected expenses. Step 5: Acquire a Death Certificate A death certificate is a necessary legal document that verifies the deceased's death and the cause of death. This document will be required for several purposes, such as closing accounts, accessing financial resources, and settling estate matters. The funeral director can guide you in acquiring a death certificate, typically through your state's vital records office. Conclusion Organizing a funeral for a loved one is an emotional and challenging task. By following these essential steps, you will be able to honor and celebrate the life of the deceased while ensuring that all funeral arrangements are taken care of. Keep in mind that while these steps cover the primary aspects of funeral planning, personalizing the funeral according to your loved one's preferences and beliefs will truly memorialize their life. Remember to seek support from friends and family, allowing yourself the care and time needed to navigate through this difficult period in your life."},{"prompt":"Liu Xiaohua is 12 years old.

Choices: - carbon dioxide - heavy pollution - chemicals in waterways - air pollution A: Answer:","completion":"Acid rain is primarily caused by air pollution. The main pollutants responsible for acid rain are sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). When these compounds are emitted into the atmosphere through industrial processes, vehicle emissions, and the burning of fossil fuels, they react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form acidic compounds. These acidic compounds then fall back to the earth's surface as precipitation (rain, snow, or fog), which is known as acid rain. Therefore, although heavy pollution, carbon dioxide, and chemicals in waterways might contribute to environmental degradation and water pollution, air pollution is the primary cause of acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. Now, I have a new situation: Two sisters named Mary and Ann went in for a blood test and found out that Mary had sickle cell anemia. Ann was normal. Answer this question please: Which sister did not have a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly? Answer:","completion":"Ann is the sister who did not have a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. To better understand this, let's take a closer look at the information provided. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for producing hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen through the bloodstream. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, causing the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped. In the context of genetics, this condition demonstrates incomplete dominance, which means that an individual with one abnormal allele and one normal allele will have an intermediate phenotype, commonly referred to as sickle cell trait. In this situation, the individual doesn't have the full-blown disease but may still experience some health issues related to the abnormal hemoglobin. Now, let's analyze the situation of Mary and Ann. Mary has sickle cell anemia, which tells us that she is homozygous recessive (ss) and has inherited two mutated alleles from both her parents. This causes all her red blood cells to have the incorrect hemoglobin, leading to the disease. On the other hand, Ann is normal, which means she does not have sickle cell anemia. Since both sisters share the same parents, we can infer that Ann is homozygous dominant (SS) or a carrier with heterozygous genes (Ss), inheriting at least one normal allele from her parents. In both cases, Ann doesn't have the disease caused by abnormal hemoglobin production. In conclusion, Ann is the sister who did not have disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Babrak Karmal (Dari/Pashto: bbrkh khrml, born Sultan Hussein; 6 January 1929 - 1 or 3 December 1996) was an Afghan politician who was installed as president of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union when they invaded in 1979. Karmal was born in Kamari and educated at Kabul University. Imprisoned from 1953 to 1956, Karmal befriended fellow inmate Mir Akbar Khyber, who introduced Karmal to Marxism. Karmal changed his name from Sultan Hussein to Babrak Karmal, which means \\"Comrade of the Workers'\\" in Pashtun, to disassociate himself from his bourgeois background. When he was released from prison, he continued his activities in the student union, and began to promote Marxism. Karmal spent the rest of the 1950s and the early 1960s becoming involved with Marxist organizations, of which there were at least four in Afghanistan at the time; two of the four were established by Karmal. When the 1964 Afghan Provisional Constitution, which legalised the establishment of new political entities, was introduced several prominent Marxists agreed to establish a communist political party. The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA, the Communist Party) was established in January 1965 in Nur Muhammad Taraki's home. Factionalism within the PDPA quickly became a problem; the party split into the Khalq led by Taraki alongside Hafizullah Amin, and the Parcham led by Karmal. During the 1965 parliamentary election Karmal was one of four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were Anahita Ratebzad, Nur Ahmed Nur and Fezanul Haq Fezan. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by the simple fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership. In 1967, the PDPA unofficially split into two formal parties, one Khalqist and one Parchamist. The dissolution of the PDPA was initiated by the closing down of the Khalqist newspaper, Khalq. Karmal criticised the Khalq for being too communist, and believed that its leadership should have hidden its Marxist orientation instead of promoting it. According to the official version of events, the majority of the PDPA Central Committee rejected Karmal's criticism. The vote was a close one, and it is reported that Taraki expanded the Central Committee to win the vote; this plan resulted in eight of the new members becoming politically unaligned with and one switching to the Parchamite side. Karmal and half the PDPA Central Committee left the PDPA to establish a Parchamite-led PDPA. Officially the split was caused by ideological differences, but the party may have divided between the different leadership styles and plans of Taraki versus Karmal. Taraki wanted to model the party after Leninist norms while Karmal wanted to establish a democratic front. Other differences were socioeconomic. The majority of Khalqists came from rural areas; hence they were poorer, and were of Pashtun origin. The Parchamites were urban, richer, and spoke Dari more often than not. The Khalqists accused the Parchamites of having a connection with the monarchy, and because of it, referred to the Parchamite PDPA as the \\"Royal Communist Party\\". Both Karmal and Amin retained their seats in the lower house of parliament in the 1969 parliamentary election.

The PDPA had some disagreements and later split into two groups, one led by Taraki and Hafizullah Amin, and the other led by Karmal.

It followed warnings that the nets may be intercepting salmon destined for the River Eden in Cumbria. The Salmon and Trout Association (Scotland) said the council could be breaching the EU's Habitats Directive. It threatened a judicial review if the local authority did not agree to halt stake net fishing immediately. A spokesman for the council said it ended the lease \\"with much regret\\". \\"However, we take our environmental responsibilities seriously and understood that to continue at this point in time without having conducted a proper scientific assessment with conclusive results would be in breach of the Habitats Directive,\\" he added. \\"Our council maintained the stake nets licences for as long as possible in the face of challenge until the legal advice indicated that this position was untenable.\\" He said the matter will be kept under review and the decision will not affect traditional haaf and poke netting on the River Annan. Andrew Graham-Stewart, the director of the Salmon and Trout Association (Scotland), welcomed the move by the council. He said: \\"Against a background of declining wild salmon stocks across almost all of the North Atlantic, the Solway rivers have been particularly badly affected with precipitous declines. \\"The evidence from rod catches is compelling.\\" The River Annan's rod catch of 317 in 2014 compared to a five-year average of 1,557. In the Nith in the same year, the rod catch was 520 - significantly lower than the 1,658 average. Mr Graham-Stewart said the River Eden's rod catch in 2014 was 40% of the five-year average.

They wanted the council to stop using these stake nets right away. A person from the council said they were sad to stop using the nets, but they want to protect the environment. They will only use them again if they find out it's okay after doing some studies. This decision won't affect other ways of catching fish in the River Annan.

Robert enjoyed science experiments while Derrick was bored of them, so","completion":"as they sat in the school science lab, Robert eagerly read through the instructions for the day's lesson while Derrick listlessly doodled on the corner of his notebook. The experiment for the day was to create a chemical reaction by combining two solutions—sodium bicarbonate and acetic acid—which would cause the formation of carbon dioxide gas. This reaction was to be demonstrated by capturing the gas in a balloon and observing its expansion. Robert's eyes sparkled with anticipation, eager to carry out the task. Derrick, on the other hand, slumped in his chair, completely uninterested in the proceedings. He had seen this experiment in some online video and thought it was anything but fascinating. Robert wasn't going to let Derrick's boredom deter him. He carefully measured the substances as instructed, making sure everything was accurate to the smallest detail. He had always been meticulous in his approach to science, fascinated by the precision required and the potential for discovery. Derrick observed Robert's diligence with mild amusement. His only motivation for the experiment was the prospect of passing time until the bell rang, signaling the end of the lesson. As Robert mixed the chemicals, the reaction commenced. The liquid fizzed and bubbled, producing a steady stream of gas which began filling the balloon. \\"Look, Derrick!\\" Robert exclaimed, unable to contain his excitement, \\"Carbon dioxide is being released, filling up the balloon with each passing moment! Isn't that amazing?\\" Derrick cracked a half-smile, feigning interest. \\"Yeah, really cool, Robert,\\" he replied, trying not to let his sarcasm show. In an attempt to engage Derrick, Robert decided to explain the real-world applications of this seemingly simple experiment. \\"You know, this reaction is actually used in fire extinguishers. The rapid production of carbon dioxide smothers the fire by cutting off its oxygen supply. Pretty cool, huh?\\" Derrick raised his eyebrows, taking a closer look at the expanding balloon. This new information changed his perspective; maybe there truly was more to these experiments than what met the eye. \\"What else can you tell me about it?\\" Derrick asked, genuine curiosity creeping into his voice. Robert could hardly contain his excitement at this newfound interest from his friend. He went on to explain how the reaction could be manipulated for different purposes, discussing how the carbon dioxide was used in soda production to create the fizzy texture, or even alter the acidity levels in soil for farmers. Derrick's mind began to wander; he imagined the various ways this chemical reaction could be utilized. From extinguishing a fire in his mom's kitchen to creating a massive volcano erupting with baking soda and vinegar for his little sister's birthday party, science began to grow on him. As the lesson came to a close, the once-lame experiment had left an indelible impression on Derrick's mind. For the first time, he saw the magic in science as much more than dull reactions and tedious calculations; it represented the essence of discovery, understanding, and endless possibilities. For the remaining science lessons, Derrick sat up straight, asked questions, and eagerly participated in experiments. He found a newfound love for the subject, inspired by the knowledge that scientific discovery had the power to change lives in some way, large or small. Robert was delighted with his friend's new attitude, and the two continued to learn and explore together, uncovering the remarkable world of science, one experiment at a time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"Officials in China say they're working hard to tackle the country's smog problem.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: China's Smog Problem: A Tackling Force Behind the Scene Introduction China, known for its booming economy and fast-paced industrial growth, has frequently hit international headlines in recent years due to its increasingly hazardous smog problem. Despite the nation's economic prosperity, air pollution has exhibited a severe impact on its environment and the health of millions of Chinese residents. Realizing the implications of this situation, officials in China assert that they are working tirelessly to confront the smog crisis and alleviate the problem. This article delves into the background, the steps being taken by the government, and the future prospects in addressing this critical environmental issue. Background: The Smog Problem Over the past few decades, rapid industrial expansion has fueled China's economic growth. However, this industrial revolution has come at a high environmental cost due to the significant rise in air pollution levels. As power plants, factories, and vehicles release vast amounts of pollutants into the atmosphere, thick smog has blanketed cities across China, leading to a host of issues. The intensity of the smog has spiked to hazardous levels in many major cities, with harmful particulates far surpassing the recommended safety thresholds outlined by both the Chinese government and the World Health Organization. As a result, public health has emerged as a significant concern, with respiratory ailments, heart diseases, and an increased risk of lung cancer linked to poor air quality. Taking Action: Steps Undertaken by the Government Recognizing the severity of the situation, the Chinese government has implemented several programs and policies aimed at tackling the country's smog problem. These measures include: 1. Setting ambitious targets for pollutant reduction: In recent years, the Chinese government has established goals to reduce particulate matter levels in the atmosphere. For instance, the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) set the goal to reduce PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) in cities by at least 18% compared to 2015 levels. 2. Regulation and enforcement: China has enacted legislation that imposes stricter environmental regulations on industries and factories, such as the amended Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law, which took effect in 2016. Government officials are actively conducting inspections, fining or even shutting down facilities that fail to meet emission standards. 3. Investment in cleaner energy technologies: The Chinese government has made substantial investments in clean energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, to reduce its reliance on coal-fired power plants, a primary source of pollution. Research and development in electric vehicles and other sustainable transportation solutions are also being heavily prioritized. 4. Public awareness campaigns: The government is working to raise awareness about the environmental impact of pollution and engaging the public to take part in the fight against smog. Initiatives include the \\"Blue Sky Protection Campaign\\" and air quality monitoring smartphone apps, which disseminate information on daily pollution levels and encourage residents to reduce their personal emissions by carpooling or using public transportation. 5. International cooperation: China is a signatory of the Paris Agreement and is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By collaborating with other nations and international organizations, China can leverage expertise and technology to combat the smog problem more effectively. Future Prospects: Challenges and Opportunities While the Chinese government's efforts are commendable, there is still a long road ahead. Challenges include the continuous rise of energy consumption due to population growth and urbanization, a lack of transparency in enforcing regulations, and public resistance to behavioral changes. However, opportunities for improvement undoubtedly exist, such as further investment in renewable energy and driving technological innovation in pollution control and sustainable transportation solutions. Conclusion The smog problem in China is a multifaceted issue that poses a significant threat to the environment and public health. While combating pollution remains an arduous task, Chinese officials are persevering with both determination and a sense of urgency. It is through a combination of ambitious targets, regulatory enforcement, technological advancements, public awareness campaigns, and international cooperation that China can effectively mitigate the smog crisis and ensure healthier, clearer skies for its citizens in the coming years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

First, we'll isolate the terms with the variable on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 97v from both sides: 153v - 97v = 97v - 97v + 155 + 237 Now we simplify: 56v = 155 + 237 2. Next, we'll simplify the right-hand side of the equation. We can do this by adding the constants: 56v = 392 3. The final step is to isolate the variable v by dividing both sides of the equation by the constant coefficient in front of v, which is 56: 56v / 56 = 392 / 56 Now we simplify: v = 7 So, the solution to the equation 153v = 97v + 155 + 237 is v = 7."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions. I am facing a new situation today: Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country will be less misshapen on the map?","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article and given the new situation you described with Stef comparing the Mercator projection map and the globe, we can determine which country will be less misshapen on the map. The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. In this case, Stef is comparing Norway and Mexico. Norway is a country near the North Pole, which means it is far from the equator. On the Mercator projection, this will cause Norway's shape and size to be greatly distorted, making it appear larger and more stretched out than it actually is on a globe. This distortion occurs due to the projection's nature, which is to accurately represent angles and directions for navigation purposes but ends up distorting sizes and shapes of areas near the poles. On the other hand, Mexico is a country close to the equator. As mentioned before, the Mercator projection performs best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Because Mexico falls within this range, its representation on the Mercator projection map will be much more accurate in terms of shape and size compared to Norway. The distortion of landmasses near the equator is significantly less when using the Mercator projection. In summary, between Norway and Mexico, the country that will be less misshapen on the Mercator projection map is Mexico. This is because the Mercator projection is more accurate for regions closer to the equator, resulting in a truer representation of Mexico's shape and size on the map, while Norway, being near the North Pole, will appear larger and more distorted."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Profiling is effective and necessary: Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"Alright, buddy, let's imagine there's a big cookie jar in your school, and sometimes, cookies go missing. The teacher wants to find out who's taking them. Profiling is like making a list of possible cookie-takers based on clues and patterns. 1. Helps us find the cookie-takers: Using profiling, we can look for kids who took cookies before or kids who often talk about how much they love cookies. This makes it easier for the teacher to keep an eye on them and make sure the cookies stay safe. 2. Saves time and energy: Instead of watching every single kid in the school, the teacher can just focus on a small group of kids who fit the profile. This way, she can spend her time teaching you fun things instead of worrying about the cookies all day long. 3. Detects patterns for better security: If the teacher notices that cookies go missing every time there's extra chocolate chips, she might come up with a profile of kids who love chocolate chip cookies. Then she can take extra care to protect the jar on those special days. 4. Shows us what works best: By figuring out the actions that lead to finding the most cookie-takers, the teacher can improve her methods. So, the more she uses profiling, the better she gets at keeping the cookies safe for you and your friends. Remember, profiling can be a helpful way to find missing cookies or find people who might need help. But it's important that the teacher always treats everyone fairly, even if they're on the cookie-takers list.

It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the Mycenaean ages. In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called Labryaden, \\"the double-axe men\\", which indicates Minoan origin. The double-axe, labrys, was the holy symbol of the Cretan labyrinth. The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. Apollo Delphinios was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands, and his name indicates his connection with Delphi and the holy serpent Delphyne (\\"womb\\").[citation needed] Apollo's sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with Britomartis (Diktynna), the Minoan \\"Mistress of the animals\\". In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the \\"Mister of the animals\\", a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute. His original name is unknown, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo, who stood by the virgin \\"Mistress of the Animals\\", becoming her brother. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is another name for the double-axe?","completion":"The double-axe is also known as \\"labrys\\". This name has roots in the Minoan culture of ancient Crete. The labrys is a symbolic double-headed axe, linked to the labyrinth, which was an important religious and cultural symbol during the Bronze Age. The term \\"Labryaden\\", which was used to refer to the priests of Delphi, translates to \\"the double-axe men\\", further highlighting the importance of this symbol. It is notable that this double-axe is often associated with female divinities in archaeological findings, which may suggest a link to matriarchal societal structures during this period. However, the specific religious and societal implications of the labrys remain a subject of scholarly debate. In addition to its significance in Minoan culture, the labrys also appears in myth and symbolism across various other ancient cultures. For instance, in Greek mythology, it is associated with the labyrinth of Knossos, where the Minotaur was said to reside. Meanwhile, in Roman interpretations of these myths, the labrys is often linked to the divine figure of Saturn, who is depicted wielding a double-axe in many artistic representations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If we're successful this year then we'll end 2018 on a much better trajectory.\\" Facebook was under much scrutiny in 2017 for a litany of issues, including admitting Russians bought ads with the intent to sway the 2016 U.S. elections. Its ad-targeting capabilities were also allowing companies to find potential customers using racially discriminatory and derogatory terms. Facebook is facing four major challenges as it matures as a company, said Aaron Shapiro, CEO of advertising agency Huge. The company needs to find its role in society, address mental health issues, assuage users' privacy concerns and remain relevant while growing revenue. But while Facebook has done a good job at acquiring companies like Instagram, it's never really addressed the other issues until now, Shapiro said. The most pressing issue Facebook has to address is fixing its \\"fake news\\" problem, said Ronn Torossian, founder and CEO of public relations firm 5WPR. His firm does crisis management for major technology companies. \\"We're living in an era where the president of the United States — arguably the most powerful person in the world — speaks about fake news as an issue every day,\\" Torossian said. \\"If you have a report coming out that says Facebook was a big purveyor of this fake news, you need to fix this thing.\\" Zuckerberg — who has taken on a personal challenge every year since 2009 — said in his post that one of the most interesting issues facing the technology industry is the concept of \\"centralization vs. decentralization.\\" Technology was expected to give people more control over their lives, he wrote. But as a handful of technology companies become the dominant players and governments used technology to monitor citizens, people increasingly believe technology is becoming a controlling, centralized power. \\"There are important counter-trends to this — like encryption and cryptocurrency — that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands,\\" Zuckerberg wrote. \\"But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.\\" The fact that Facebook is used by more than a billion people on a daily basis makes it both an ideal communication tool and an easy way to spread misinformation, said eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson. People see major tech companies as having vast control over their lives, and Facebook will have to learn how to balance its influence with public perception. \\"Recognizing its power, and understanding how that power can be used for both good and potentially bad purposes and doing something about that is probably Facebook's biggest challenge,\\" Williamson said. The fact that Zuckerberg is acknowledging the problems is admirable and positive, 5WPR's Torossian said. And saying he'll do so on his Facebook page is an intelligent move. \\"It's PR 101. ... He doesn't have to do an interview. He doesn't have to shout it from the rooftops. All he has to do is put it out on Facebook, and he controls the message,\\" Torossian said. See the full text of Zuckerberg's post below: ||||| Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sets a personal challenge each year, a kind of public New Year’s resolution that he posts about all year long. A few years ago he set out to learn Mandarin. He also built a robot butler for his home. Last year, he toured America to spend more time with regular citizens (who were also likely Facebook users). Zuckerberg’s goal this year: Fix Facebook. Or at least improve some of the most important elements of Facebook that have gotten the company into hot water over the past 12 months, like its unintended role as a propaganda weapon for Russia during last year’s U.S. presidential election. Here’s how he described it in a post on Thursday. The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do -- whether it’s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent. My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues. We won’t prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools. If we’re successful this year then we’ll end 2018 on a much better trajectory. You might be thinking: Well isn’t fixing a company’s issues already the job of the CEO? Yes, it is. And Zuckerberg seems to realize that too, adding that one of the reasons he’s choosing this challenge is so he won’t distract himself from Facebook’s important problems by going around and killing all his own food (that was his 2011 challenge). “This may not seem like a personal challenge on its face,” Zuckerberg continued. “But I think I’ll learn more by focusing intensely on these issues than I would by doing something completely separate.” Zuckerberg has been very philosophical over the past 12 months, regularly posting about his greater ambitions for tech and Facebook in particular. This time, Zuckerberg talked about the importance of “centralization vs decentralization” in tech — in other words, who is benefitting from tech’s tremendous power. “A lot of us got into technology because we believe it can be a decentralizing force that puts more power in people’s hands,” he wrote. “But today, many people have lost faith in that promise. With the rise of a small number of big tech companies — and governments using technology to watch their citizens — many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it.” Facebook, of course, is one of those “big tech companies” with an immense amount of power. Not only does the company help shape the news for more than two billion people worldwide, but it controls a massive share of the global digital advertising market, which is making it difficult for smaller companies, including media companies, to survive. But Zuckerberg says he’s thinking about all of that and taking his role as the leader of one of the world’s premier tech giants very seriously. “This will be a serious year of self-improvement and I’m looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together,” he wrote. Every year I take on a personal challenge to learn something new. I've visited every US state, run 365 miles, built an...

To conclude that the hypothesis \\"There are three problems\\" is true, we would need additional evidence or information suggesting the nature of the third problem related to the topic under discussion, which is the Gulf War Syndrome. For example, if you were given information about a first problem (e.g., difficulties in diagnosing Gulf War Syndrome) and a third problem (e.g., lack of widespread medical knowledge about the Syndrome), then you would be able to conclude that there are indeed three problems. Alternately, we could reinterpret the hypothesis as \\"There are at least three problems\\" and assess it based on the available information. The premise only discusses the second problem, which indicates there exists at least one other problem. However, without information about a third problem, we still cannot conclude that the rephrased hypothesis is true. In summary, the premise provided emphasizes the existence of at least two problems related to Gulf War Syndrome, but it does not offer sufficient evidence to conclude that there are indeed three problems, or even to assume the presence of a third problem.

Context: The measurement of affective symptoms in older persons who decline cognitively is uncertain. The authors investigated whether mood variability predicts dementia in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).', 'Three-year observational study after a clinical trial.', 'Community follow-up of outpatients ascertained from retina clinics.', 'One hundred sixty patients with AMD.', \\"Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) administered every 2 weeks for 6 months to subjects; Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) administered to subjects' knowledgeable informants.\\", 'Twenty-three subjects (14.4%) declined cognitively. Age, education, baseline GDS score > or =5, and variability in GDS scores (i.e., fluctuations between adjacent time points) were associated with cognitive decline. For GDS variability, each 1 unit increase in the residual standard deviation (SD) of the GDS increased the risk for cognitive decline by 93% (IDR = 1.92; 95% CI [1.27-2.91]). Thus, subjects with a residual SD of 1 were nearly twice as likely to become demented as subjects with no variability in GDS scores. The risk for subjects with SDs of 2 increased more than threefold (IDR = 3.68; 95% CI [1.61-8.47]). A multiple regression analysis showed that GDS variability was a significant risk factor for dementia after controlling for significant covariates.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid A:","completion":"The final step of the process highlighted above is the eventual precipitation of the sulfuric acid, leading to the formation of acid rain: A: The sulfuric acid (H2SO4) present in the atmosphere, formed through the series of chemical reactions involving sulfur compounds from coal burning, combines with atmospheric moisture (water vapor) to create a highly acidic solution. The moisture, now containing sulfuric acid, forms clouds along with other pollutants present in the atmosphere such as nitrogen oxides (NOx). These nitrogen oxides react with water and oxygen to form nitric acid (HNO3), another strong acid contributing to the overall acidity of the cloud droplets. B: As the clouds containing sulfuric acid and nitric acid float through the atmosphere and eventually encounter meteorological conditions suitable for precipitation, they release rain, snow, fog, or hail, which is collectively termed as acid rain. Acid rain is characterized by a lower pH value (usually below 5.6) compared to normal rainwater, and has the potential to create harmful environmental effects. C: When acid rain falls on the Earth's surface, it can cause damage to ecosystems, infrastructure, and built environments. The acidity of the rain may lead to the increased weathering of rocks and the leaching of essential minerals from soil, making it difficult for plants to grow and negatively impacting wildlife. Acid rain can also directly harm aquatic life by altering the pH levels of water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, and streams. Moreover, acid rain can cause indirect damage by contributing to eutrophication, leading to algal blooms that can deplete oxygen levels in water and potentially cause the death of fish and other aquatic organisms. D: Acid rain may also lead to human health issues by degrading air quality, as the pollutants that contribute to acid rain, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can exacerbate respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis. Additionally, acid rain can have harmful effects on materials and infrastructure, as it can hasten the corrosion of metals and the deterioration of buildings and monuments, particularly those made of limestone, marble, or other carbonaceous materials. In conclusion, after the series of reactions involving sulfur compounds from coal burning, the final step is the formation and precipitation of acid rain when sulfuric acid and nitric acid in the atmosphere combine with water vapor. This acid rain has a wide range of negative environmental impacts, including damage to ecosystems, water bodies, human health, and infrastructure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It may be easiest to lump tasks together by time (e.g., morning tasks, evening tasks) rather than by purpose. Do you want your routine to make you more productive? To get fit? To live a healthier life? Before you can go about creating your routine, you’ll need to know what you want that routine to eventually accomplish. For example, if your goal is to live a healthier life, you may want to craft a routine that helps you to get more sleep at night or that lets you cook healthier meals for yourself. The goal of your routine may also determine when in your day you’ll follow your routine. For instance, many people follow exercise routines in the morning because that’s when their energy levels are highest. Many people find it useful to write down the daily tasks they set out for themselves; this will serve as a constant reminder of your routine and also give you the satisfaction of being able to cross completed items off the list! If you want to follow a strict routine, you can also list the time you want to complete each task at (e.g., “7:30-eat breakfast. 8:00-leave for work.”). If you want to leave more room for spontaneity, simply write down your daily tasks in the order you want to complete them in. If you’re just starting a new routine, the tasks in your routine will seem much easier to achieve when you break them into smaller mini-tasks. Divide each task into its component parts and accomplish each mini-task 1 at a time. For example, if your weekly routine involves cleaning your apartment, then rewrite that task into smaller tasks like vacuuming the carpet, dusting the furniture, and cleaning the bathroom. If a task takes too long, break it into smaller tasks that will give you a feeling of accomplishment more quickly to keep you motivated.","completion":"In order to create a daily routine, it's essential to first identify your goals and tasks that are necessary to accomplish. These tasks may include daily obligations like taking medication or new habits you want to develop. Begin by writing down these tasks in a list, which you can then use to plan out your routine. When organizing your daily tasks, group them based on shared goals or the time of day you want to complete them, such as morning or evening tasks. This will make planning and following the routine more simplified and manageable. Determine the overall goal of your routine, whether it's to increase productivity, get fit, or lead a healthier life. Knowing your desired outcome will help you create a routine that aligns with your aspirations and ensures that it is tailored to achieve specific results. Additionally, consider the time of day when you are most energetic and likely to follow through with the tasks. Many people prefer to exercise in the morning, for example, when their energy levels are highest. Once you have organized your tasks, write them down in a daily planner or list, which will serve as a constant reminder of your routine, contributing to personal accountability. Crossing off completed items also provides a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. For stricter routines, include specific times for each task. If you want more flexibility, simply list tasks in the order you want to complete them, allowing room for spontaneity. When starting a new routine, breaking tasks into smaller mini-tasks can make achieving daily goals seem more manageable. Breaking a task, like cleaning an apartment, into smaller components like vacuuming, dusting, and bathroom cleaning, can provide a greater sense of accomplishment and maintain motivation. In summary, to create a successful daily routine, identify the tasks you want to include, group them based on goals or time of day, determine the overall goal of your routine, tailor the routine to your energy levels, write down daily tasks in a planner, and break larger tasks into smaller mini-tasks for easier completion. Incorporating these strategies will contribute to the development of a personalized daily routine that promotes growth, productivity, and achievement of personal goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The description for the product reads: ‘This Ohuhu® Herb Grinder is a small, but powerful device with sharp teeth that you can use to grind up herbs, tobacco, marijuana, and other small plant materials.’ Advertisement Advertisement Now, I know what you’re thinking – it blatantly states that the grinder is meant for grinding weed. But let’s just give A.Maddox a break here, not everyone goes as far as to read the description of what they’re buying – especially if at first glance the product looks to suit your needs. However, the Amazon user learned the hard way to always read the description for future buys when her ‘rosemary fell right through’ the grinder. In a face-palm-worthy review, the user wrote: ‘The rosemary just fell right through. I’m sure it works well for nugs but I actually need a spice grinder and it’s impossible to find now thanks to the weed industry. ‘I wish they would call them something else so I don’t have to sort through 89679376 products like this to find an actual spice grinder.’ Of course, she also finished the review by giving the product just one star – which really, is quite generous considering it didn’t even grind her rosemary.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In Guazacapán, now a municipality in Santa Rosa, Pedro de Alvardo described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies. Pedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla.

This victory came during the 2007-2008 season of the prestigious European club competition. The final match was held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia, making it the first UEFA Champions League final to be played in Russia. In this highly-anticipated match, Manchester United faced off against another English club, Chelsea FC. The two teams were contesting for the top spot in European club football, with each side boasting a squad full of talented players. The match proved to be closely contested, with both sides exhibiting excellent football throughout the game. At the end of regular time, the score was tied at 1-1. Cristiano Ronaldo had opened the scoring for Manchester United in the 26th minute with a header. However, Chelsea responded through Frank Lampard's goal in the 45th minute. As the match remained deadlocked after 90 minutes, it proceeded into extra time. Despite the tireless efforts of both teams, no goals were scored during this 30-minute period, and the match advanced to a penalty shootout to determine the winner. Goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar emerged as the hero for Manchester United in the penalty shootout, saving Chelsea's Nicolas Anelka's decisive penalty. Manchester United secured the victory by winning the shootout 6-5, thus claiming their third UEFA Champions League title. The 2007-2008 triumph was a memorable achievement for Manchester United, as it marked the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, a tragic event in which several of the club's players lost their lives.

But the dispute casts a light on a bigger question that some experts say may need to go all the way to the Supreme Court: Just how responsive must the Internet be to the Americans With Disabilities Act?

However, this interpretation of the Act has led to calls for revisiting the issue as technology and the internet continue to become increasingly integral to everyday life. Many view the lack of specific mention of websites as a gap in the legislation that needs to be addressed. Advocacy groups and legal scholars argue that the spirit of the Americans With Disabilities Act should extend to online services, ensuring that individuals like Melissa Earll have equal access and opportunities in the digital landscape. In recent years, several cases addressing the applicability of the Americans With Disabilities Act to the internet have made their way through the courts, with mixed outcomes. Some courts have ruled in favor of applying the Act to websites, while others have sided with companies such as eBay in asserting that the law does not apply to online platforms. As the issue gains more attention, there is a growing need for clear guidance on the application of the Americans With Disabilities Act to the internet. The fact that the Supreme Court may be called upon to address this matter highlights the importance of the issue and the necessity for a definitive answer. Until such guidance is provided by the courts, online businesses will continue to face the challenge of balancing the desire to be inclusive and accessible with the potential legal ramifications of doing so. Accessibility advocates, on the other hand, will keep pushing for the recognition that the internet must be responsive to the Americans With Disabilities Act, in order to prevent discrimination and to promote equal opportunities for all."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - A symbiotic star is a type of binary star. They are usually a white dwarf with a companion late sequence red giant. They are indicated by the exhibition of spectral lines of the highly contrasting temperatures of the red giant (~3000 K) and the white dwarf (~20 000 K). The white dwarf gains mass from stellar wind from the red giant or gravitational streaming. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name \\"white dwarf\\" was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922. The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take many billions of years. - Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. This is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models. Brightness refers to an absolute term and should not be confused with Lightness. - A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass (roughly 0.38 solar masses) in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature as low as 5,000 K and lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars. - A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called \\"multiple star systems\\". These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means. Research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star. It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric. - AG Draconis is a binary system consisting of an orange - red giant star and a white dwarf star that revolve around each other every 550 days . It has a baseline apparent magnitude of around 9.8 and flares up to around magnitude 7.3 and is one of the most - studied of symbiotic star systems and its variations in brightness have been observed for 124 years . The outbursts occur every 15 years and last for 3 -- 6 years . The larger star is thought to be an orange giant around 1.5 times as massive as the Sun that has swollen to around 35 times the diameter of the Sun with a spectral type measured at K3IIIep . The smaller star is a compact hot white dwarf around 0.4 times as massive as the Sun , with a surface temperature of around 80,000 K. The star is located in a spherical halo around the Milky Way , and is a nova variable , erupting every 10 -- 15 years . - The apparent magnitude of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of 27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512.
