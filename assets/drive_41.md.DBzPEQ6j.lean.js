Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Cola,bubble gum\\" correctly answer the question \\"What did the FDA find in the e-cigarette samples that were tested?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"Cola, bubble gum\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What did the FDA find in the e-cigarette samples that were tested?\\" Based on the paragraph provided, the FDA found carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans, including diethylene glycol, a chemical used in antifreeze.

This is because the Earth's atmosphere gets thinner as you go higher up, which leads to less absorption and retention of the sun's heat. 2. Seasons: Fact 2 mentioned that temperatures vary with altitude and season. The Earth's tilt and its orbit around the sun cause different regions to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year, leading to seasonal temperature changes. 3. Sun's heat: The sun's heat is a primary factor in determining temperature variations, as it is the main source of warmth for the Earth.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the song that was described by Phares as having a sexy menace? ? Bryant identified \\"Son of Three\\" as an example of \\"when the Breeders set out to rock\\", noting \\"the chugging guitars and stomping drums.\\" The Breeders re-recorded \\"Son of Three\\" in July 2002 for its release as Title TK's third single; this version is faster than the album track, and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year. The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's \\"voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain,\\" as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: \\"Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side.\\"An earlier version of \\"Full on Idle\\", Title TK's eighth track, was released on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of \\"Full on Idle\\" sound almost the same, but The Village Voice's Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardian's Betty Clarke cited the line \\"Obey your colorist, bleach it all away\\" as an example of Title TK's amusing, off-center lyrics. On \\"Sinister Foxx\\", Deal repeatedly sings \\"Has anyone seen the iguana?\\" She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: \\"Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana.\\" Another line, \\"I'm in beer class every Thursday night\\", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a \\"sexy menace\\", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.Moores identified in \\"Forced to Drive\\" the \\"quiet-LOUD-quiet\\" dynamic... Answer:","completion":"The song that was described by Phares as having a \\"sexy menace\\" is \\"Sinister Foxx\\".

Today we're going to talk about the Amazon rainforest. Do you know where it is? That's right! It's in South America. It's a big, wonderful place with lots of different plants and animals living there. Trees are some of the stars in this big jungle party, but something sad is happening to many of them. Our scientist friends from all around the world are telling us that more than half of the tree species in the Amazon are in danger of disappearing. That means they might not be there for us to see and enjoy when we grow up. Imagine that you have 100 trees in the Amazon. What the scientists are saying is that more than 50 of them could go away. Can you believe that? That's a lot of trees, and it's not a small problem. Trees are very important because they help clean the air we breathe, and they give homes to the birds, monkeys, and other animals that live in the rainforest. Why are the trees in danger? Well, there are a few reasons. One is that people sometimes cut down trees to make space for farming or building new things. This is called \\"deforestation.\\" Another reason is climate change. You know how the weather changes from day to day, right? Climate is like the weather, but it's how things are over a long time. When the climate changes a lot, it can make it hard for the trees to grow and stay healthy. So, what can we do to help our tree friends in the Amazon rainforest? There are a few things. We can plant more trees, which is like throwing a big welcome-back party for the trees who might have left already. We can also recycle and use less paper, because paper comes from trees too! Another thing we can do is learn more about the rainforest and teach our friends and families about it. The more people know about this special place and its trees, the more they'll want to help protect them. The Amazon rainforest is amazing, and the trees are some of its most wonderful residents. Let's do our best to help them, so that future generations of children (like your own kids someday!) can enjoy the beauty and wonder of this magical forest."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Title: Uh, kateccheer?

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly address the top three laws in science. Let me provide you with a clear answer. The top three fundamental laws in science are typically considered to be: 1. Newton's Laws of Motion: These are three fundamental laws, proposed by Sir Isaac Newton, that govern the motion of objects. They describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. 1.1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force. 1.2. Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net external force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, F = ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. 1.3. Third Law (Action and Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 2. Laws of Thermodynamics: These are fundamental laws that describe the behavior of energy in thermodynamic systems. 2.1. First Law (Conservation of Energy): Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be transferred or converted from one form to another. 2.2. Second Law (Entropy): In any energy transfer or transformation, the total entropy of a system and its surroundings will always increase over time, or in a closed system, it will tend towards a maximum value. In simple terms, energy tends to disperse and become less available for doing useful work. 2.3. Third Law (Absolute Zero): As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero (0 Kelvin), the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. 3. Laws of Electromagnetism: These laws, mainly discovered by Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell, describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism. 3.1. Gauss's Law: The total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed within the surface. 3.2. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction: A changing magnetic field will induce an electromotive force (emf) in a conductor, which can lead to an electric current. 3.3. Ampere's Law with Maxwell's Addition: The magnetic field produced by an electric current is proportional to the current, and a changing electric field can also create a magnetic field. These are prominent examples of fundamental scientific laws; however, there are several other important laws in various scientific fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Finnish Finnish:","completion":"Kolmanneksi, olemme kaikki täysin tietoisia erityisen vaikeista haasteista sekä uusista mahdollisuuksista, joita taloudellinen globalisaatio tarjoaa pienille ja keskisuurille yrityksille. Taloudellinen globalisaatio on monimutkainen ilmiö, joka vaikuttaa yritystoimintaan ympäri maailmaa. Pienille ja keskisuurille yrityksille (pk-yritykset) tämä on erityisen haastavaa, koska ne eivät välttämättä pysty kilpailemaan samalla tasolla kuin suuremmat, monikansalliset yritykset. Joitakin haasteita, joita pk-yritykset kohtaavat taloudellisen globalisaation myötä, ovat muun muassa lisääntynyt kilpailu toimialoilla, joiden rajat ovat hämärtyneet; tarve sopeutua nopeasti muuttuviin markkinoiden vaatimuksiin; ja tarve investoida teknologiaan, koulutukseen ja muihin resursseihin, jotta yritykset voivat pysyä kilpailukykyisinä globaaleilla markkinoilla. Toisaalta taloudellinen globalisaatio tarjoaa myös uusia mahdollisuuksia pk-yrityksille. Esimerkiksi kansainvälisten markkinoiden avaaminen voi tarjota uusia asiakkaita ja liikekumppaneita yrityksille, jotka aiemmin eivät ole olleet kykeneväisiä laajentumaan ulkomaille. Lisäksi eri maiden väliset vapaakauppasopimukset saattavat alentaa kaupan esteitä ja helpottaa pk-yritysten pääsynä uusiin markkinoihin. Yksi tapa, jolla pk-yritykset voivat hyödyntää taloudellisen globalisaation mahdollisuuksia ja selviytyä sen haasteista, on innovaatio. Kehittämällä uusia tuotteita, palveluita tai toimintatapoja yritykset voivat erottautua kilpailijoistaan ja saavuttaa markkinaosuuksia. Myös digitalisaatio ja teknologian hyödyntäminen liiketoiminnassa voi parantaa yritysten kilpailukykyä ja mahdollistaa niiden laajentumisen globaaleille markkinoille. Pk-yritysten on myös tärkeä investoida henkilöstönsä osaamiseen ja kehittymiseen, jotta ne voivat pysyä ajan tasalla alan muutoksista ja käyttää uusinta teknologiaa tehokkaasti ja innovatiivisesti. Tämä voi sisältää esimerkiksi koulutusohjelmien tai työpajojen järjestämistä, jotka tähtäävät työntekijöiden ammatillisen tietotaidon parantamiseen. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että taloudellinen globalisaatio asettaa pk-yrityksille sekä ainutlaatuisia haasteita että uusia mahdollisuuksia. Pienet ja keskisuuret yritykset voivat parhaiten hyötyä näistä mahdollisuuksista ja vastata haasteisiin kehittämällä innovatiivisia tuotteita ja palveluita, investoimalla henkilöstönsä osaamiseen ja kehittymiseen sekä hyödyntämällä digitalisaatiota ja teknologiaa liiketoiminnassaan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: the structure found in the cell that contains strands of dna is called a(n)??","completion":"The structure found in the cell that contains strands of DNA is called a nucleus. The nucleus is a double-membrane bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells and serves as the storehouse for genetic information. It is responsible for multiple cellular functions, such as growth, reproduction, and the transmission of hereditary traits. The nucleus houses the cell's DNA, which is organized into tightly coiled structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes contain linear DNA molecules that are associated with histone proteins, collectively known as chromatin. This complex structure of DNA and proteins helps to package the DNA efficiently into the limited space available within the nucleus, while also protecting and regulating access to the genetic information. In humans, there are typically 46 chromosomes, with 23 inherited from each parent, making a total of 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females and XY for males). Within the nucleus, the DNA strands are also accompanied by a variety of proteins that play a crucial role in the replication, transcription, and repair of the genetic material. These processes are essential for the proper functioning of a cell. Additionally, the nucleus is surrounded by a double-layered structure called the nuclear envelope, which helps maintain the integrity of the genetic material by separating it from the cytoplasm and its various cellular activities. The nuclear envelope consists of two lipid bilayers, with the outer membrane being continuous with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, while the inner membrane is supported by a network of proteins called the nuclear lamina. Tiny openings known as nuclear pore complexes are embedded in the nuclear envelope, allowing for the selective exchange of molecules, such as RNA and proteins, between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Inside the nucleus, there is another essential structure called the nucleolus. The nucleolus is not membrane-bound and is primarily responsible for producing ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a crucial component of ribosomes, which are the cellular machinery responsible for the synthesis of proteins. In summary, the structure found in the cell that contains strands of DNA is called the nucleus. The nucleus serves as the control center of the cell, housing and protecting the DNA organized into chromosomes, while also facilitating essential processes such as replication, transcription, and repair of genetic material. The presence of the nucleus distinguishes eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus and have their DNA dispersed throughout the cytoplasm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Options: A HGH is a natural substance. B HGH is needed to help bones and muscles grow.

They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. But I can use this background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

Additionally, some farming ants gather and store aphid eggs, carrying hatched aphids to plants in the spring. These ants protect the aphids from predators, ensuring the continuation of this relationship. 2. Joe studied ants that farm fungus: There is no information provided about these ants protecting aphids or interacting with aphid predators. Joe's focus was on a different aspect of ant farming behavior. Based on the available information, the answer to the question is: Joe learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators.

The villagers are kind, hospitable, and deeply religious, gathering at their beloved church every Sunday to seek solace and guidance from Father Cyril. Little do they know their idyllic world of simplicity and peace is about to be turned upside down by an unknown terror lurking in the shadows of the dense forest that surrounds their village. The movie begins with the mysterious and gruesome death of a local shepherd, Adrian, whose torn apart body is discovered on the outskirts of the woods. Fearful gossip spreads like wildfire among the villagers, and suspicions begin to rise about the presence of a wolf which may have wandered down from the mountains. Mayor Renaud implements a strict curfew and warns all villagers to avoid venturing near the forest. As panic starts to grip the village, the bloodshed continues, each attack growing closer and closer to the village's heart. The villagers, desperate to put an end to the bloodbath, form search parties to hunt down the wolf. Father Cyril, a calm and rational man, insists that the villagers remain calm and seek refuge and protection in their faith and the sanctity of the church. One fateful night, as the village gathers for their traditional festive feast, the unimaginable happens. The wolf attacks the village square, sending terrified villagers fleeing into the night. In the midst of the chaos, the church doors are flung open, and Father Cyril, with his arms wide, invites the villagers inside, promising safety within the church's divine sanctuary. As the church fills with people, the village's hunter, Leon, and his hunting party take it upon themselves to confront the wolf and protect their community. Armed with torches and weapons, they venture into the darkness, determined to hunt down the beast. Meanwhile, inside the church, Father Cyril attempts to inspire faith and hope in his fearful flock, beseeching them to remain united in prayer. As the evening progresses, a storm begins to brew outside, leaving the hunters' mission even more treacherous. Just when it seems the wolf may remain beyond their reach, Leon is able to track it down and inflict a fatal wound. His victory, however, comes at a terrifying cost as, during the wolf's dying moments, it transforms into a man. Shocked and unsettled, the hunters soon discover the truth - the wolf is not an ordinary beast, but a werewolf who has terrorized the village for ages. Word of the shocking revelation spreads. When brought to light, it becomes clear that the werewolf is none other than Father Cyril's estranged, long-lost brother Edgar, presumed dead years ago. Confronted with this horrifying truth, Father Cyril is left broken and anguished, filled with regret for not recognizing the signs of his brother's dark affliction. The movie ends with the villagers coming to terms with their horrifying ordeal. Through unity and forgiveness, they find strength in each other and renew their faith, aiming to rebuild their once-peaceful village. Father Cyril, though forever scarred by the traumatic events, vows to carry on with his mission to lead the community in their spiritual journey.

Please answer a question about the following article about Pub: The Wine and Beerhouse Act 1869 reintroduced the stricter controls of the previous century. The sale of beers, wines or spirits required a licence for the premises from the local magistrates. Further provisions regulated gaming, drunkenness, prostitution and undesirable conduct on licensed premises, enforceable by prosecution or more effectively by the landlord under threat of forfeiting his licence. Licences were only granted, transferred or renewed at special Licensing Sessions courts, and were limited to respectable individuals. Often these were ex-servicemen or ex-policemen; retiring to run a pub was popular amongst military officers at the end of their service. Licence conditions varied widely, according to local practice. They would specify permitted hours, which might require Sunday closing, or conversely permit all-night opening near a market. Typically they might require opening throughout the permitted hours, and the provision of food or lavatories. Once obtained, licences were jealously protected by the licensees (who were expected to be generally present, not an absentee owner or company), and even \\"Occasional Licences\\" to serve drinks at temporary premises such as fêtes would usually be granted only to existing licensees. Objections might be made by the police, rival landlords or anyone else on the grounds of infractions such as serving drunks, disorderly or dirty premises, or ignoring permitted hours.

Q:What is the last name of the actual person who began composing songs in a distinctive, original style on his return to England in 1918? Answer the above question based on the context below: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

The band's line-up includes founder Josh Homme (lead vocals, guitar, piano), alongside band members Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboard, percussion, backing vocals), Michael Shuman (bass guitar, keyboard, backing vocals), Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and Jon Theodore (drums, percussion). Formed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band, Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy rock music. Their sound has since evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences, including working with ZZ Top member Billy Gibbons, Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, and Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan who has been a steady contributor to the band. Foo Fighters frontman and former Nirvana drummer, Dave Grohl, joined in late 2001 to record drums for their third album. Songs for the Deaf was released in August 2002, again featuring Lanegan, along with former A Perfect Circle guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen to the touring line-up following the album's release.

The singles \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Go with the Flow\\" became hits on radio and MTV, with the former just outside the Billboard Top 40. \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Go with the Flow\\" were also featured on the first iterations of the popular video games Guitar Hero and Rock Band (respectively).

As he sorted through some newly arrived gadgets behind the counter, he noticed a customer, Ian, wandering around the aisles, seemingly unsure of where to go. Ian, tired of walking around in circles, finally approached Eric with a sigh of relief. \\"Excuse me,\\" he said, \\"I'm looking for a new WIFI router for my home, but I can't seem to locate the right section. Could you help me out?\\" Eric was well-versed in the store's layout and products, so he quickly scanned the store, searching for the familiar WIFI router display to guide Ian. However, a recent store-wide reorganization had temporarily left him confused about the new location of the routers. Sensing Eric's hesitancy, Ian chimed in, \\"You know, I think I saw a display of routers near the back of the store, past the laptops and near the printers. It was a bit hidden, so it's possible that this is the section I need.\\" With Ian's description, a spark of recognition lit up Eric's eyes. \\"That's right! I apologize for my confusion - the store was recently rearranged, and my memory is still catching up.\\" The two shared a light-hearted laugh, before Eric eagerly followed Ian through the aisles - a rare role reversal for the usually knowledgeable Eric. As they approached the section Ian had mentioned, the display of WIFI routers came into view. \\"Ah, yes, this is it,\\" said Ian with satisfaction. Now that they were in the proper section, Eric regained his confidence and expertise, offering Ian some insightful suggestions on which router would best suit his needs. Ian carefully considered each router's capabilities and price range before ultimately selecting one. Eric assisted with the process, answering questions and providing additional information as needed. Despite the initial confusion, Ian was grateful for Eric's expertise and professionalism. Once the transaction was complete and Ian had the new router in hand, he thanked Eric for his help and headed towards the store exit. Eric continued with his duties, now with a renewed sense of the store's layout and a newfound appreciation for the occasional assistance of a helpful customer. Looking back on the whole experience, Eric realized that situations like these were learning opportunities. No one knows everything all of the time. Sometimes, even the most knowledgeable experts need a little guidance, a fact that Ian inadvertently reiterated when he showed Eric where the WIFI routers were."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Why would people go into a ship? Possible A: heading east, run aground, near shore, list to port, party Why is \\"heading east\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Heading east\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense significantly represents a purpose or direction of travel for people going into a ship. In the context of this question, individuals boarding a ship are likely to do so for various reasons, such as transportation, exploration, trade, or leisure. \\"Heading east\\" sheds light on one of the many possible intentions people might have for embarking on a voyage, which in turn, provides valuable context for their decision to go into a ship. By mentioning a cardinal direction (i.e., east), this answer highlights that ships serve as a means to navigate across geographical territories. In historical context, for instance, eastward journeys might have been undertaken to explore new lands, establish trade routes, or as part of a military campaign. Depending on the region, eastward journeys could be symbolic of cultural and commercial exchange, pilgrimage, or adventure. Navigating eastward from various parts of the globe, explorers discovered new continents, opened trade routes with other countries, and made countless scientific, geographical, and technological advancements. In the modern context, \\"heading east\\" still carries significance as it could reflect the goal of reaching a particular destination for business, tourism, major events, or reconnecting with family and friends. With East Asia being a global economic powerhouse and Europe offering a rich cultural heritage, any voyage heading east is likely to create a sense of curiosity and excitement. Ships, including ferries and cruise lines, ply various routes to the east and offer a comfortable and leisurely way of travel. They also provide an opportunity for passengers to experience the beauty of the oceans, enjoy on-board entertainment, and interact with like-minded fellow travelers. In contrast, the other proposed answers like \\"run aground,\\" \\"near shore,\\" \\"list to port,\\" and \\"party,\\" don't necessarily focus on the underlying motivations for people to go into a ship. Instead, they seem to refer more to unexpected occurrences or general reasons, which might not directly imply a voyage's central purpose or explain why people would choose to board a ship based on human common sense. Given the diverse motivations for traveling and the broad range of experiences a ship journey can provide, it is clear that \\"heading east\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense delves into a more specific rationale, providing both historical and contemporary contexts, making it an appropriate and meaningful explanation for why people would go into a ship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. After reading the other tepid reviews and comments, I felt I had to come to bat for this movie. Roeg's films tend to have little to do with one another, and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark. What this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith. The only other film like it-in terms of its religious message-would have to be Tolkin's \`The Rapture.' I am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural. It is a simple movie about Catholic faith, miracles, and redemption--though you would never guess it till the end. It is also the only movie I can think of whose resolution turns, literally, on a pun. As a (happily) fallen Catholic myself, I know what the movie is about, and I find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based, then it will go right over you head. As a film-as opposed to a story-\`Cold Heaven' it is not ground-breaking. While \`The Rapture' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery, \`Cold Heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities. There are no striking shots, no edgy effects, no attempts to fit the content to the form. It is workmanlike shooting, but subdued. Nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama. It is a simple story that unfolds simply. It may seem odd; but at the end the mystery is revealed. It looks ambiguous; but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of Catholic dogma. In this regard, \`Cold Heaven' has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like \`The Sting,' or \`The Sixth Sense,' or \`Final Descent,' or Polanski's \`A Pure Formality.' All of these are films with a trick up their sleeves. They may frustrate you along the way, but they have a point-an obvious one, indeed--but the fun is, at least in part, in having been taken in. Still, even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line, it is worth watching for way it directs-and misdirects-you. Try it-especially if you are, or have ever been, a Catholic. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer seems to truly enjoy the movie because of its thoughtful look at religious faith and its focus on Catholicism. They admit that it is not a cinematic masterpiece in terms of visuals or acting, but they still find its simple story endearing. The reviewer encourages others, especially those familiar with Catholic faith, to give it a watch.

This post came to me at 10pm last night, on Day 16 of this challenge, after a day of holidaying in London and with my head (and feet) too weary to put finger to touchscreen. Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music. This moment has even gained a moniker in British homes, based on the theme tune to the real masters of the four-times-a-week cliffhanger, London-based soap opera Eastenders. It's call a \\"ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba\\" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation). Eastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim.

Probably it was widely watched in Britain The text suggests this answer because EastEnders is depicted as an extremely popular show in Britain, regularly employing the dramatic technique of a cliffhanger to keep viewers hooked and eager for the next episode. As such, it would likely have a substantial viewer count under normal circumstances. However, the specific episode in question wasn't just any regular episode; it was a highly anticipated one as it was celebrating the show's 30th birthday and was providing a long-awaited answer to a question that had been left unanswered for 14 months: \\"Who killed Lucy Beale?\\" This indicates it was a special event, attracting not only regular viewers but possibly also previous viewers who had stopped watching the show but tuned in for this special occasion and people who had heard about the hype and curiosity surrounding this particular episode.

Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a cholera epidemic in the African country of Zimbabwe has now infected over 80,200 people. The epidemic is the worst cholera outbreak in Africa for fifteen years. The United Nations agency stated that approximately half of all the patients that died of the disease did not reach any of the 365 cholera treatment centers located in the country. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"A vaccine is currently being researched to solve this\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it does not specifically mention that a vaccine is currently being researched to solve the cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe. However, it is essential to address the cholera outbreak, and having a vaccine would undoubtedly be a significant step forward to combat the issue. In general, organizations like WHO and local health authorities continuously work on vaccines and other solutions to deal with epidemics, including cholera. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the Vibrio cholerae bacterium. The infection is spread mainly through contaminated food and water. If not treated promptly, it can lead to severe dehydration, shock, and death in just a few hours. To control cholera outbreaks, preventative measures like practicing good hygiene, providing clean water sources, and food safety are essential. The development of an effective cholera vaccine can provide substantial benefits to areas affected by the disease, like Zimbabwe. Vaccination campaigns can be conducted to target high-risk populations, reducing the incidence of infection and, consequently, the number of fatalities. Also, vaccinated individuals would contribute to the development of herd immunity, making the overall community less susceptible to cholera. Currently, there are several licensed cholera vaccines available, such as Dukoral, Shanchol, and Euvichol-Plus, which have been developed and are used in various regions worldwide. However, these vaccines might not be specifically tailored to deal with the particular strain of Vibrio cholerae responsible for the Zimbabwe outbreak. This possibility highlights the importance of continuous research and development in the field of vaccines. It is worth noting that creating and implementing a new vaccine requires rigorous scientific research, clinical trials, regulatory approval, and logistical considerations. Distribution and coordination of vaccine programs on a national scale, or even just in high-risk areas, demands considerable resources, infrastructure, and community engagement. In conclusion, while the paragraph provided does not explicitly confirm that a vaccine is being researched to address the cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe, it is reasonable to assume that such efforts may be underway. Tackling a cholera outbreak entails various strategies, with prevention, vaccination, and appropriate sanitation measures being crucial to control and mitigate the disease's impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The parents who took their terminally ill boy from his hospital bed and fled Britain were last night found in Spain, along with their son. Police tracked down five-year-old Ashya King with his father Brett and mother Naghmeh to a hostel in southern Spain. The parents were arrested and were last night in police custody, while Ashya was rushed to a specialist hospital in Malaga with a police guard for urgent medical treatment. 'Leave us in peace: Brett King and his terminally ill son Ashya, who was removed by his parents from hospital on Thursday, are seen in the video posted on YouTube last night. His parents, who are Jehovah’s Witnesses, had taken Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on Thursday, after doctors told them he had only months to live. Ashya had a brain tumour the size of a tangerine removed last weekend – but the family had been told the cancer would return and would probably be inoperable. He was left with very limited movement, unable to speak and dependent on a machine for food. Hampshire Police broke the news of the parents’ arrest on Facebook, saying: ‘Ashya has been found. He is in Spain. 'Police are speaking to his mum and dad and we are waiting to hear on Ashya’s condition. This is all we know at this time, but he has been found. Thank you to everyone who has been incredible in helping us spread this appeal.’ International chase: Brett and Naghmeh King have been arrested after taking Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on Thursday, and transporting him to Spain via France. Hampshire officers will be travelling to Malaga today to aid the investigation. Within an hour of the arrest, Ashya’s oldest brother Naveed posted a video on YouTube showing his father explaining their actions. Holding his son’s hand tenderly and touching his fingers, Mr King, 51, insisted Ashya had been safe and well, saying: ‘We were most disturbed today to find that his face was all over the internet and newspapers, and we have been labelled as kidnappers and putting his life at risk.’ He added: ‘Call off this ridiculous chase. We are not neglecting our son. He’s in perfectly good health. ‘My son’s smiling, he’s happy. We’re doing things as a family. We just want to be left in peace.’ Mr King said that he wanted his son to have a special treatment called proton beam therapy, but had been told by doctors in Southampton that it was not available on the NHS. ‘He’s very sick. I just want to get on with his treatment. And I’m not coming back to England if I cannot give him the treatment I want.’ Earlier in the day, a European arrest warrant had been issued for Mr and Mrs King for neglecting Ashya’s medical needs. Armed Spanish police were waiting outside the couple’s Costa del Sol holiday home, but they were apprehended after checking into a hostel called Esperanza in Benajarafe, 14 miles east of Malaga. A police source said: ‘We were alerted after the couple checked into the hostel in Benajarafe. We arrested them in their bedroom.’ The couple are expected to be taken to Madrid today for an extradition hearing. The couple are expected to oppose extradition so they can argue at a new hearing they should be released on bail for humanitarian reasons. Ashya has been taken to the Hospital Materno-Infantil in Malaga which specialises in treating seriously ill children. Doctors there are liaising with the boy’s British medics, but Hampshire Police said it was too soon to say when he might come home. Hiding place: The King family were tracked down at Hostel Esperanza in Benajarafe, 14 miles east of Malaga. Naveed was last night sleeping with his five other siblings at one of the rooms at the hostel. A source close to the case said: ‘The oldest boy has been left in charge of the other children. He is due to check out on Sunday.’ Mr King said he found out about alternative treatments for his son after going online. He said on the YouTube video: ‘I’ve come to find out through the internet.

Was it a shame that there were fewer episodes? Of course. More is always better. Was this a bad season (to the degree that many have put it)? No. There was a plot, a catastrophe to avert and a villain to stop (albeit a villain who I feel was depicted to be alot more fearsome and intimidating than he should have been considering his non-threatening ability). New characters were introduced. Old characters had their own personal issues to contend with in the midst of everything. Sure, it could have been better if there were more than 11 episodes.

Movie plot title: Stick It Movie plot: Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a rebellious 17-year-old who is forced to return to the regimented world of gymnastics after a run-in with the law where she and two of her skateboard friends accidently cause damage to a development house. A judge sentences Haley to her ultimate nightmare, attending an elite gymnastics academy run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges).Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. She made it to the World Championships, but the previous year she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.After arriving at the school, Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and after that, she can leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts (as well as her past that she avoids talking about) causes conflicts. After getting the cold shoulder the first day at the gym, Haley realizes what she is up against.At the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired: the flaws in judging.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: What type of disturbance do even dominant plants depend on in many biomes? A: A:","completion":"A: Disturbances are essential for the functioning and adaptation of Earth's ecosystems. Although all the presented factors might affect the ecosystems in various ways, the type of disturbance that even dominant plants depend on in many biomes is likely related to (d) periodic disturbances. These disturbances often create opportunities for different species to thrive and maintain biodiversity, which is vital for the health and functioning of biomes. Periodic disturbances are natural events that occur in cycles or at regular intervals, such as wildfires, flooding, storms, or pest outbreaks, that help maintain a balance within ecosystems. For example, natural wildfires are essential for maintaining biodiversity, as they clear away dead and decaying plant matter, recycle nutrients, and create openings for sunlight to penetrate the forest floor, benefiting both dominant and understory plants. Similarly, flooding can deposit sediment rich in nutrients onto floodplains that nourish the dominant plants. These natural events also promote turnover in plant populations. Dominant plants rely on disturbances to keep their ecosystems functioning and thriving, as the gaps created by these events allow for other species, including younger plants, to grow and support the overall functioning of the ecosystems. Moreover, periodic disturbances play a significant role in preventing invasive species from becoming dominant and potentially causing harm to native ecosystems. In conclusion, periodic disturbances are essential for maintaining ecosystem health and biodiversity by creating opportunities for plant species, even the dominant ones, to thrive. These natural forces play a crucial role in the functioning and adaptation of biomes, supporting the survival of plants and promoting the health of Earth's overall ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. and the situation: Two groups of people participated in a geriatrics study. Group D had people over 65 years old, while group Y had people in their 40's in its composition. Answer the following question: Which group had people with stronger immune systems? The answer is:","completion":"Group Y had people with stronger immune systems. Step 1: Understand the background information provided The background information tells us that old age begins in the mid-60s, and during this time, the immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms. - Copenhagen (, ); ) is the capital and most populated city of Denmark. It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371. The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and is separated from Malmö, Sweden, by the strait of Øresund. The Øresund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road. - Odense Steel Shipyard was a Danish shipbuilding company located in Odense. It was best known for building container ships for its parent group, A.P. Moller Maersk Group, including the Mærsk E-class in 2006 which at the time were the biggest container ships in the world. The global financial crisis led to Maersk announcing its closure in 2009 and the last new ship was delivered in January 2012. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Nicolas-Henri Jardin (22 March 1720 31 August 1799), neoclassical architect, was born in St. Germain des Noyers, Dept. Seine-et-Marne, France, and worked seventeen years in Denmark as an architect to the royal court. He introduced neoclassicism to Denmark. - Svendborg municipality is a municipality (Danish, \\"kommune\\") in Region of Southern Denmark on the southeast coast of the island of Funen, as well as on the islands of Drejø, Hjortø, Skarø, Thurø, and Tåsinge off Funen's southeastern shores in south-central Denmark.

The main town and the site of its municipal council is the city of Nyborg. - Faaborg or Fåborg is an old port town located on Faaborg Fjord in Faaborg-Midtfyn municipality on the island of Funen in Denmark. By road, Faaborg is located southwest of Odense, north-northwest of Svendborg, and roughly southeast of Middelfart, depending upon the route. It has a population of 7,178 (1 January 2014). With its busy port, narrow streets and attractive old houses, the town is popular with tourists, particularly in the summer months. Faaborg was formerly the seat of Faaborg municipality. The seat of the new municipality is Ringe. Both municipalities use(d) Faaborg's medieval coat of arms. - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry. - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark.

He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. - Aarhus (officially spelled Århus from 1948 until 31 December 2010) is the second-largest city in Denmark and the seat of Aarhus municipality. It is located on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, northwest of Copenhagen and north of Hamburg, Germany. The inner urban area contains 264,716 inhabitants and the municipal population is 330,639. Aarhus is the central city in the East Jutland metropolitan area, which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Nyborg is a city in central Denmark, located in Nyborg Municipality on the island of Funen and with a population of 16,528 (as of 1 January 2014). Nyborg is one of the 14 large municipalities created on 1 January 2007. This change boosted the population of Nyborg Municipality from around 18,000 to 31,009. - Jutland , also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula , is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east. - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties: - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Glorup is a manor house located between Nyborg and Svendborg in the south - east of the Danish island Funen . Rebuilt to the design of Nicolas - Henri Jardin and his pupil Christian Josef Zuber in 1763 -- 65 , it is considered one of the finest Baroque complexes in Denmark and was included in the 2006 Danish Culture Canon . - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Svendborg is a town on the island of Funen in south-central Denmark, and the seat of Svendborg Municipality.

Back in the United States, Morgan Keay and a friend who had also studied inMongoliastarted an organization. They named it Itgel the Mongolian word for \\"hope\\". The Itgel Foundation has helped bring foreign scientists to Mongoliato research and treat reindeer diseases. They also helped Tsaatan workers build a community and visitor center. The building includes guest rooms for tourists. The Tsaatan not only work as guides, they now provide services for travelers. The community works in partnership with international tour operators, who had formerly been in control of the services. People in the community designed the center, which they also own and manage. Before the visitor center was built, families earned an average of 100 dollars a year. Now Morgan Keay says the average is 3 to 4 times that. Money also goes into a community account. Four years ago the Tsaatan had fewer than 500 reindeer. Now the herd has already reached 900. Morgan Keay says the Tsaatan are becoming economically independent for the first time.

Mishcon de Reya, lawyers acting for a group of business people and academics, said it would be unlawful for a prime minister to trigger Article 50 without a full debate and vote in Parliament. It comes after the UK voted to leave the EU in the 23 June referendum. Number 10 said Parliament should \\"have a role\\" in deciding the way forward. Following the referendum, David Cameron announced he would stand down as prime minister by October and would leave his replacement to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Once the legal process is triggered there is a two-year time limit to negotiate an exit deal from the EU. Brexit: What happens now? Does the UK have to trigger Article 50? Article 50 - the simplest explanation you'll find Mishcon de Reya's clients argue that under the UK constitution the decision to trigger Article 50 rests with Parliament. The firm has been in correspondence with government officials to seek assurances over the process. The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said Mishcon de Reya believed that any prime minister using executive powers to start the process would be acting unlawfully because they would be overriding the 1972 European Communities Act that enshrines UK membership of the EU. The law firm says that constitutionally only legislation can override legislation and an act of Parliament is required to give the prime minister legal authority. The passage of such an act could in theory provide the majority of MPs who favoured Remain the chance to block the UK leaving, our correspondent said, but he added that this seemed \\"constitutionally inconceivable\\". Kasra Nouroozi, a Mishcon de Reya partner, said: \\"We must ensure that the government follows the correct process to have legal certainty and protect the UK Constitution and the sovereignty of Parliament in these unprecedented circumstances. \\"The result of the referendum is not in doubt, but we need a process that follows UK law to enact it. \\"The outcome of the referendum itself is not legally binding and for the current or future prime minister to invoke Article 50 without the approval of Parliament is unlawful. \\"We must make sure this is done properly for the benefit of all UK citizens. Article 50 simply cannot be invoked without a full debate and vote in Parliament.\\" By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent It has come as a shock to many that the referendum result itself is not legally binding in UK law and it alone does not trigger the UK's departure from the EU. That has to be done under the withdrawal process laid down in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. It's argued that a prime minister acting alone under prerogative powers lacks the constitutional authority to trigger Article 50 and an act of Parliament would need to be passed giving him or her that authority. The passage of that act would of course provide the opportunity for MPs (a majority of whom favour Remain) to express their views on Brexit and in theory vote according to their consciences. However, it seems constitutionally inconceivable that Parliament would fly in the face of the Leave vote secured through a national referendum and refuse to pass an act that gave the prime minister authority to begin the \\"divorce\\" process. In other words, the referendum has changed nothing legally but everything politically. Can the law stop Brexit? European leaders have said the UK should not delay leaving the EU, with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker saying the UK does not have \\"months to meditate\\" on activating Article 50, The two-year negotiation period under Article 50 can be extended only with the unanimous agreement of the remaining 27 member states. If there is no extension, the UK ceases to be a member of the EU on the conclusion of an agreement within the two years, but in any event two years after notice has been given. David Cameron's spokeswoman said triggering Article 50 was \\"a matter for the next prime minister\\". A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \\"As the prime minister said in the Commons, we have now got to look at all the detailed arrangements, and Parliament will clearly have a role in making sure that we find the best way forward. \\"It will be important to ensure in moving ahead that the interests of all parts of the United Kingdom are protected and advanced.\\" Ex-defence secretary Liam Fox, who is bidding to become the next Tory leader, said any MP that voted against the referendum result \\"does not deserve to have a place in the House of Commons\\".

Please answer this question: 'Carve her name with pride' is a book (and film) about which World War II heroine?","completion":"\\"Carve Her Name with Pride\\" is a book and film about the extraordinary World War II heroine Violette Szabo. The book, written by R. J. Minney, was first published in 1956 and later adapted into a movie in 1958, directed by Lewis Gilbert. Violette Reine Elizabeth Szabo was a British spy and secret agent, born in France on June 26, 1921, to an English mother and a French father. Szabo was an agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), an undercover organization created by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the Second World War. The SOE was responsible for training and deploying secret agents to work with resistance movements in occupied Europe, aiming to sabotage enemy military operations, gather intelligence, and support the local resistance fighters. Violette Szabo's story is remarkable, not just because of her heroic actions during World War II but also because of her personal life. She was married to Etienne Szabo, a French Foreign Legion officer, who was killed in North Africa in 1942. Violette was only 21 years old and had a young daughter when she decided to join the SOE to honor her husband's memory. She was trained in various skills required to survive as a secret agent, such as weapons handling, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of explosives. After completing her training, Szabo was assigned the codename \\"Louise\\" and was sent on her first mission to France in April 1944. Her primary objective was to gather intelligence and organize the local Maquis (the French resistance) fighters to help with the upcoming D-Day landings and the liberation of France. Szabo's second mission, in June 1944, was to sabotage German communication lines in the Limoges area of France. Tragically, she was captured by the Nazis after an ambush on June 10, 1944. Despite being subjected to brutal interrogations and torture by the Gestapo, Szabo refused to give any information about her fellow agents or SOE operations. She was then transferred to Ravensbrück concentration camp, where she was executed on February 5, 1945, just three months before the end of the war. Violette Szabo's brave actions and unrelenting determination to protect her comrades and the resistance resulted in her posthumous awards, including George Cross–the highest civilian decoration in the United Kingdom for gallantry and the Croix de Guerre by the French government. \\"Carve Her Name with Pride\\" not only recounts Violette Szabo's heroic actions during World War II but also celebrates the spirit of resistance, courage, and determination shown by all who fought against tyranny. Her life and brave actions continue to inspire generations, and the book and film help remember and honor the sacrifices of this remarkable woman."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The first step in the process is preheating the oven to the desired baking temperature. Preheating is a crucial step in baking as it sets the ideal environment for the cake to bake properly. The required temperature may vary depending on the specific type of cake you're baking. Some cakes might need a relatively low temperature, around 325 degrees Fahrenheit (about 165 degrees Celsius), while others might require a hot oven, around 375 degrees Fahrenheit (about 190 degrees Celsius), for example. Preheating the oven before placing the cake inside ensures a consistent temperature throughout the baking process. When you place your cake in the oven before it's fully preheated, it starts baking in a lukewarm environment that gradually gets hotter. This uneven temperature can result in an undercooked or unevenly baked cake. To preheat your oven, you can turn it on and set it to the desired temperature. Typically, it takes about 10 to 15 minutes for the oven to reach the required temperature, but it could take longer depending on the oven. Some ovens are equipped with an indicator light or a sound that signals when preheating is complete. If yours doesn't have that feature, you can use an oven thermometer to check if it's reached the correct temperature. Once the oven is preheated, you can continue with the next steps in the recipe, such as preparing the cake batter. It's generally a good idea to start preheating your oven before you begin mixing ingredients so that it's ready by the time your cake batter is. Therefore, preheating the oven to the desired baking temperature is the first step you need to take in the process of baking a cake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When the iron is exposed to oxygen, a chemical reaction called oxidation begins to take place on the surface of the metal. 4. The iron starts to oxidize. During the chemical reaction, iron atoms lose electrons and bond with oxygen atoms, which by itself is a process known as oxidation. 5. The iron starts to rust.

I've seen Irreversible and can understand the comparisons. However, I cannot begin to understand the people who've trashed this film. I can see how the end may have come off extreme but I'd be lying if I didn't say I wished that every guy who's ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what Jared got. Conversely, it didn't solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn't pretend to is what made me appreciate it. The comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with. I certainly did and intently. I'm 24 years old. The way the film drags made it realistic to me. People have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film, not only do they lose interest, they demolish whatever has been built, and call it rubbish. When in actuality it's their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as Talia Lugacy's. Rosario Dawson displayed the numbness of self-destruction flawlessly. I think she portrayed Maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act I rarely ever see done well. Often times, much like the films \\"aimed at teens\\" mentioned in the prior comment, the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to: drone-like existence in the waking hours, working some dead end job to survive (and distract) and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings. I thought this film told the truth and I appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape.

Again you say, \\"Of course.\\"But that's not quite true. Nobody else has ever heard your voice--the way you hear it. When you talk, you set up sound waves . The air outside your head carries the sound waves to your outer ears. But, of course, the sound of your voice begins inside your head. The bones of your head pick up the sound waves, too. They carry the sound waves straight to your inner ears. You get the sound from the outside and the inside too. Other people get just the sound waves from the outside. That's why they don't hear your voice the way you do. When you talk, other people hear your voice _ . A) through the bones of your head B) from the outside C) from the inside D) all of the above The answer is:","completion":"B) from the outside The phenomenon of hearing one's own voice differently is fascinating and somewhat perplexing. It stems from the way that sound waves travel both through the air and through the bones of our head. When we speak, we create sound waves that propagate through our vocal cords, larynx, and mouth, which then reverberate and radiate through the surrounding environment. These sound waves can travel in multiple directions and media, which ultimately affect how we perceive our own voice compared to how others perceive it. As you mentioned, when we speak, we set up sound waves within our head that are then picked up by the bones and carried to our inner ears. This occurs through a process called bone conduction, which is essentially the conduction of sound to the inner ear through the bones of the skull. Simultaneously, the air outside our head carries the sound waves to our outer ears through a process known as air conduction. The fusion of both air conduction and bone conduction allows us to perceive our own voice differently than those around us. Other people, however, only experience the sound waves from the outside. When they listen to your voice, they receive the sound waves solely through air conduction, as the sound waves travel through the air from your mouth to the listener's outer ear. The unique blend of sound waves transmitted directly through the bones of your head is something that only you can experience. Consequently, your voice may appear different to others than what you perceive it to be. As a result, the correct answer to the question, \\"When you talk, other people hear your voice _,\\" is B) from the outside. This is because the sound waves traveling through the bones of your head are not detected by others, and only the external sound waves produced by your voice are perceived by their outer ears through air conduction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-arising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan and the Greco-Indian Kingdom (180 BC - 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). The first figural portrayals of the Buddha, previously avoided by Buddhists, appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth. The Yavanajataka and Paulisa Siddhanta texts in particular show Greek influence. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way. A long, long time ago, there were some very interesting kingdoms in places that are now called Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Tajikistan. These kingdoms had a mix of Greek and Indian culture, which means they took some ideas and arts from both places and made something special and new that we now call Greco-Buddhism. The people in these kingdoms talked about their beliefs and sent messengers to other countries like China and Sri Lanka. They made beautiful artwork that had never been seen before and began showing pictures of an important figure called the Buddha. These new ideas and ways of showing the Buddha even started to look like other important gods from Greek stories! Some of the big heroes from ancient Greece and the practices they followed, like the ceremony of burning incense, giving flowers and food, began to mix with the beliefs and practices of Buddhism. One of the kings from that time, Menander I, liked these new ideas so much that he decided to follow this new Buddhism and become a part of their stories! These mixtures of Greek and Indian culture also helped to share new and exciting discoveries about the world, like how the Earth is round and the stars move around! These ideas traveled and helped make new ideas in India too! So, you see, these Greco-Buddhist kingdoms were very important because they spread ideas, art, and knowledge to many different places in the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can do this either using a Sharpie for a simple circuit or a printed out version from a computer program. Only one of these is needed, so select according to your preference. The schematic should contain a detailed description of all parts, as well as easy to follow connections. If no simulation program is used, assemble and test one or more prototypes of the circuit on a breadboard. Breadboards are very easy to use, and allow one to view the results of a circuit in real time without the need for solder or permanent etches. Circuit boards are about a dollar apiece, and are simply a layer of copper over an insulator. The typical size is usually 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) by 5 inches (12.7 cm). Drawing is simple; all that is required is an indelible marker, such as a Sharpie. A ruler is also helpful. (Skip this step if you aren’t using the computer program and are using the Sharpie method.) Print the design out from the software's print menu. Make sure the print is on a glossy paper (like those in magazines or separate glossy paper). Turn on the electric iron (the same one used for clothes). Carefully cut out the design and position it on the circuit board. Put the hot iron directly on top of the circuit board for about 45 seconds. Take the circuit board (careful it's hot). Wash the paper out such that the black ink is stuck to the copper circuit board. Draw out your circuit on your board with the Sharpie. Note that it's really difficult to draw out a circuit design in real life, unless it's as simple as a led and a battery. Keep in mind that copper cannot be between components, for example, if connecting an LED, there must be a gap in the copper between the positive and negative points of connectivity. Without a gap, the electricity would flow around the LED, as opposed to through it. Remember laws of electricity, all circuits must end at either a negative or ground, or no current will flow. Use thin lines, but lay the ink on thick, it is important that the copper is dissolved before the ink, and that there are no thin patches in the ink exposing copper.","completion":"This article provides a guide on how to create a simple circuit using either a Sharpie or a computer program, detailing the process of drawing and assembling the circuit on a breadboard or copper circuit board for testing and functionality."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Missing U.S. Marine Chopper Found Crashed Near China Border The wreckage of a U.S. marine chopper on an aid mission in Nepal that was reported missing hours after the Himalayan nation was hit by a 7.3 magnitude temblor on Tuesday has been found near the country’s border with China, the U.S. military’s Pacific Command said on Friday. The wreckage of the UH-1Y Huey helicopter, which was carrying six U.S. marines and two Nepalese soldiers when it was declared missing, was found just before 2 P.M. local time in an area approximately 8 miles north of Charikot, in Nepal’s northeastern Dolakha district. “An assessment of the site is ongoing and a thorough investigation will be conducted,” U.S. Pacific Command spokesman Major David Eastburn said in an emailed statement. Earlier, Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a spokesman for Nepal’s home ministry told TIME that the chopper had been found in Dolakha’s Kalinchok village. “It crashed in a slope near Kalinchok [Hindu] temple,” Dhakal said. Reuters, meanwhile, quoted Iswori Prasad Paudyal, the top civil servant in Nepal’s defense ministry, as saying that three bodies had been found in the wreckage of the chopper. “The search for others is continuing. As the helicopter has broken into pieces and totally crashed there is no chance of any survivors,” he told the news agency. The helicopter was on a mission to deliver aid to earthquake victims around 85 miles east of Nepal’s capital Kathmandu when it was declared missing. The U.S. marines were part of a joint task force set up in the aftermath of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on April 25 that killed over 8,000 people. The quake, which was centered in a mountainous region to the northwest of Kathmandu, was followed by a series of smaller aftershocks — and then on May 12, by violent tremors triggered by a large 7.3 magnitude rupture with an epicenter to the capital’s northeast, between Kathmandu and Mount Everest. Dolakaha was among the districts hardest hit by the second quake on Tuesday, with the tremors knocking down buildings and killing more than 100 people in the already devastated South Asian nation. As news of the missing U.S. chopper emerged shortly after Tuesday’s quake, American and Nepalese air and ground forces fanned out across the region in a massive search effort. Indian forces also assisted in the search, according U.S. Pacific Command.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.

Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. Ellington was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1965 but no prize was ultimately awarded that year. Then 66 years old, he joked: \\"Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn't want me to be famous too young.\\" In 1999 he was posthumously awarded a special Pulitzer Prize \\"commemorating the centennial year of his birth, in recognition of his musical genius, which evoked aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and culture.\\" In September 1965, he premiered the first of his Sacred Concerts. He created a jazz Christian liturgy. Although the work received mixed reviews, Ellington was proud of the composition and performed it dozens of times. This concert was followed by two others of the same type in 1968 and 1973, known as the Second and Third Sacred Concerts. These generated controversy in what was already a tumultuous time in the United States. Many saw the Sacred Music suites as an attempt to reinforce commercial support for organized religion, though Ellington simply said it was \\"the most important thing I've done\\". The Steinway piano upon which the Sacred Concerts were composed is part of the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Like Haydn and Mozart, Ellington conducted his orchestra from the piano - he always played the keyboard parts when the Sacred Concerts were performed. Despite his advancing age (he turned 65 in the spring of 1964), Ellington showed no sign of slowing down as he continued to make vital and innovative recordings, including The Far East Suite (1966), New Orleans Suite (1970), Latin American Suite (1972) and The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse (1971), much of it inspired by his world tours. It was during this time that he recorded his only album with Frank Sinatra, entitled Francis A. & Edward K. (1967). Although he made two more stage appearances before his death, Ellington performed what is considered his final full concert in a ballroom at Northern Illinois University on March 20, 1974.

Step 1: Analyze the problem To better understand the issue, we should first examine the issue of wiki spam. Wiki spam can be defined as unwanted content or links that are added to wikis by spammers, typically for promotional purposes or to harm the site. This can harm the overall quality and credibility of the wiki, making it difficult for genuine users to find accurate information. Step 2: Consider the limitations of existing solutions The blog post mentions that implementing a posting throttle could be inefficient, as, particularly in wikis that are not frequently updated, spam can accumulate over time. This would make it harder for users to find valuable content after a period of absence. Step 3: Introduce FOAFKey as a solution The FOAFKey proposal could be a more effective solution to the problem of wiki spam. FOAFKey is a system that uses distributed social whitelists as a means to authorize users based on their relationships and connections with other known users. Step 4: Explain how FOAFKey works With a FOAFKey-enabled wiki/weblog, only users who are on a whitelist may post to the wiki. Users would simply need to enter their email address or the SHA1 hash of their email address for confirmation. This would help prevent spam from unauthorized users, as only those with a confirmed email address within the whitelist would be permitted to post content. Step 5: Discuss potential fallback option In situations where a user is not part of the initial whitelist, an alternative user authentication method can be implemented. For instance, the wiki could allow users to upload a document or image to prove their identity. This would serve as a fallback option for the rare instances when a genuine user is not recognized by the FOAFKey system. Step 6: Highlight the benefits of implementing FOAFKey Implementing a FOAFKey-enabled wiki/weblog would significantly reduce the amount of spam by filtering out unauthorized users more effectively than simply using a posting throttle. This would lead to a cleaner and more informative wiki, making it a more valuable resource for its users."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, her colleagues had started to notice that her work lacked the usual enthusiasm and dedication she once displayed. Projects were taking longer to complete, deadlines were missed, and phone calls went unanswered. Rachel, Samantha's supervisor, had tried talking to Samantha about her slipping work performance, but their conversations had never amounted to any real change. Rachel grew increasingly concerned about the company's reputation and its ability to meet client expectations, so she decided that a written warning was necessary. She hoped that it would serve as a wake-up call to Samantha, and perhaps motivate her to seek help in managing her personal circumstances so that they wouldn't negatively impact her work anymore. The written warning addressed several specific aspects of Samantha's work performance: 1. Consistent tardiness over the past few weeks, which had resulted in a breakdown of communication and teamwork among her colleagues. 2. Failure to meet important deadlines, causing strain on the rest of the team and negative feedback from clients. 3. A noticeable decline in the quality of her work, including poorly-written emails, sloppy presentations, and incomplete research. Rachel also mentioned in the written warning that this was not a personal attack on Samantha but rather a measure to ensure the overall success and productivity of the company. She added that she understood the challenges that Samantha was facing in her personal life and encouraged her to seek support or time off if necessary. Upon receiving the written warning, Samantha's initial reaction was a mix of embarrassment, anxiety, and resentment. However, after taking some time to reflect, she realized that Rachel was just doing her job and had the company's best interests in mind. Determined to turn things around, Samantha decided to have an open and honest conversation with Rachel about her struggles. She explained the toll that her father's illness and her family's situation had taken on her mental and emotional well-being. Rachel listened empathetically and together, they came up with a plan to help Samantha get back on track and to prevent her personal life from affecting her work performance. This plan involved: 1. A temporary reduction in Samantha's workload so that she could focus on her family and mental health. 2. A referral to the company's Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which offered free counseling sessions and resources to help Samantha cope with her father's illness and the stress that came with it. 3. Regular check-ins and communication between Samantha and Rachel to monitor her progress, make necessary adjustments, and ensure that she was receiving the support she needed. As Samantha began to take the necessary steps to address her personal struggles and improve her work performance, she felt a renewed sense of motivation and dedication. She also developed a deep sense of gratitude towards Rachel, who had not only been understanding but had taken the time to help her find the resources and support she needed. Over time, Samantha's performance at work improved, her relationships with her colleagues strengthened, and she began to feel at peace about the fact that she could not control everything that happened in her life. The written warning, initially perceived as a setback, had ultimately served as a catalyst for Samantha's transformation and growth, both personally and professionally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity.

Article: The centenary of the birth of William Faulkner, one of the great modern novelists, was celebrated in September 1997. Faulkner wrote about the southern states of the United States of America where he grew up, and where his family had an important part to play in the history of that region. His work became a touchstone for insights into the troubled issues of southern American identity, race relations, and the family interrelationships of the old time southern gentry . Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi on September 25, 1897. Despite his interest in writing, he left Oxford High School, Mississippi, without graduating. After World War I, he entered the University of Mississippi as a special student, a right to study which was granted to retired soldiers, although Faulkner had only finished training with the Air Force in Canada, and not entered combat . Faulkner began to write poems, a verse play, short stories and finished his first novel Sartoris in 1928. His fiction was centered for 14 of the 19 novels published during his lifetime in a fictional region called Yoknapatawpha County. The name is said to come from the Indian Chickasaw word meaning split land. In December 1950, Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. When he accepted it in Stockholm, his speech emphasized that he wished to continue writing, but in a positive way that affirmed the power of humanity to prevail over adverse circumstances. As he said in his speech, he still felt that, despite the threat of nuclear war then hanging over the world, the central concern of the writer should be \\"the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself\\". He wanted the tensions and problems that he had cast the spotlight on in the southern states of America to be resolved by the life-affirming attitudes and action of his characters. Like playwright Tennessee Williams, Faulkner was a major voice who spoke for the troubled heart of the southern states of America. His achievement is all the more remarkable because, as a schoolboy, he was... Question: Which of the following statements about Tennessee William is true?

A paraphrase is a restatement or rewording of a sentence or text to express the same meaning using different words. In this case, the two sentences are not reworded but are actually very identical, with only a slight difference in punctuation that does not significantly alter the meaning. Both sentences state that L'Estany is a municipality in Catalonia, a province of Spain, and that it is part of the autonomous community of Barcelona. The primary, and nearly imperceptible, difference between the two is in punctuation. The first sentence uses normal spaces after commas, while the second sentence has a space before and after the semicolon. However, it's important to note that the use of the semicolon in the second sentence seems unusual and can be seen as a typographical error as it does not follow the standard English or Spanish practice of punctuation. The semicolon does not provide any new or contrasting information that could differentiate it from the first sentence. Overall, these two sentences can be considered paraphrases as they convey the same meaning, despite the slight anomaly in punctuation.

Please answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE/BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children who have been detained apart from their parents. \\"We have a plan to do that,\\" the secretary told reporters at an event in Washington Thursday morning. Shortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units. David Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \\"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\\" he told VOA. The administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \\"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts – that should be the end of the policy,\\" Bier added. The moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties. Nielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act. \\"I want to be very clear on this.

Some consider its conclusion to be marked by the Roman conquest of the Greek heartlands in 146 BC after the Achean War, while others point to the final defeat of the Ptolemaic Kingdom at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Ultimately, the move of the Roman Empire's capital to Constantinople in 330 AD signifies a further shift of power and influence towards the Eastern Mediterranean, and the adoption and adaptation of Greek culture into the wider Roman world.

From first impressions, the app presents a clean, minimalistic interface that is highly accessible to users. The intuitive layout makes navigating through the galleries a breeze, even for the most technologically-challenged individuals. This is a massive relief, as I have encountered many apps that suffer from overcrowded design and complex navigation. One of the greatest strengths of the com.simplemobiletools.gallery app is its customization options. By catering to individual preferences, the app ensures every user feels right at home. You can easily group your media according to folders or albums and sort them by date, name, or size. Additionally, the app allows for changing views, enabling users to switch between grid and list-style layouts as they see fit. Another noteworthy feature is the extensive selection of editing tools. Users can make basic adjustments such as cropping, rotating, and resizing, as well as apply multiple filters to enhance their photos. While it is no substitute for a powerful photo editing software, it is certainly a welcome addition to any gallery app. However, it is worth noting that there are some minor drawbacks to the app. For example, the video playback feature seems to be lacking in optimization, resulting in occasional stuttering and control response issues. This might cause some frustration for those keen on watching videos within the app itself rather than utilizing a separate video player. Additionally, though the app is regularly updated for bug fixes and improvements, some users may still experience sporadic crashes or slow loading times. Overall, the com.simplemobiletools.gallery app is a commendable addition to the world of mobile gallery apps. Its user-friendly interface, excellent customization options, and basic editing tools make it an ideal choice for the majority of users.

This figure shows three relatively complex virions: the bacteriophage T4, with its DNA-containing head group and tail fibers that attach to host cells; adenovirus, which uses spikes from its capsid to bind to the host cells; and HIV, which uses glycoproteins embedded in its envelope to do so. Notice that HIV has proteins called matrix proteins, internal to the envelope, which help stabilize virion shape. HIV is a retrovirus, which means it reverse transcribes its RNA genome into DNA, which is then spliced into the host’s DNA. (credit “bacteriophage, adenovirus”: modification of work by NCBI, NIH; credit “HIV retrovirus”: modification of work by NIAID, NIH).

Question 2: Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will first provide individual responses, and then analyze whether the answers are the same. Question 1: If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, what is value? Step 1: Understanding the concept of beauty being subjective If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it means that aesthetic perception varies from person to person. Different individuals have their unique tastes and preferences, leading to varying opinions on what is beautiful. Step 2: Defining value Value generally refers to the importance, worth, or usefulness of something. Step 3: Relating beauty to value Since beauty is subjective, value can also be subjective. People assign different value to different things based on their personal preferences, beliefs, and emotional connections. Answer to Question 1: If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then value can also be considered as an individual's subjective assessment of the importance, worth, or usefulness of an object or concept. Question 2: Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Step 1: Understanding the concept of subjectivity The phrase \\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\" implies that beauty is a subjective experience, which depends on the individual. Step 2: Evaluating the diversity of opinions and preferences Various cultures, societal norms, personal experiences, and individual preferences greatly influence our concept of beauty. People may disagree on what they find beautiful, suggesting that beauty is not an objective standard. Answer to Question 2: Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder as it depends on an individual's personal experiences, preferences, and cultural background. Comparing the answers to the two questions: While both answers deal with the subjectivity of personal perceptions (beauty and value), the questions address different concepts. Question 1 is focused on understanding the concept of value and its potential subjectivity, whereas Question 2 aims to confirm whether beauty is indeed a subjective experience. So, although the answers may share a similar theme of subjectivity, they are not the same as they address different aspects of personal perceptions and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

Do you pick Bill Belichick or Pete Carroll in the totally unlikable Super Bowl? Be honest, unless you’re a fan of either team, you don’t want either the New England Patriots or Seattle Seahawks to win Super Bowl XLIX. They’re two of the most arrogant teams in football, an attitude that stems from their respective head coaches, Bill Belichick and Pete Carroll. When you have two unlikable teams and coaches battling in the biggest game of the year, how do you possibly decide for whom to root? Luckily, FTW is here to break it down for you and let you know which coach will be the least worst to see holding the Lombardi trophy on Sunday. You may not have one, but everybody knows someone with the uncle who’s always having money trouble, the occasional brush with the law and a new girlfriend every year with a name like Brandy, Brielle or Genesis. He wears a Paul Simon 1986 Graceland tour T-shirt to Thanksgiving dinner and you always have the perfunctory 30-second conversation with him during which he asks “how’s school” and you reply “I graduated six years ago?” That’s the football Bill Belichick. He dresses like a slob, as if to show he’s his own man and no one can tell him what to do. It’s like when a high schooler gets her upper ear pierced against her mother’s wishes. But, okay, creepy may be too harsh. Let’s just say if there was an open seat next to him on the subway, you’d opt to stand instead. The deflated footballs are a fantastic story but, ultimately, there’s not enough there there to turn it into anything more than great media fodder and some minor offseason sanctions. It will fill the radio and TV airwaves during Super Bowl week and then will be forgotten exactly at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday when the game kicks off. This will barely be a blip on Belichick’s football obituary. But Spygate? Oh my. If Spygate happened today — hoo boy. A team illegally taping other practices? Reports that it happened before a Super Bowl? A half-million dollar fine? A half-hearted Belichick apology — so much more oily than those mind games he played this week? Destroyed tapes? TMZ would have had its hands on those in no time, or at least the iPhone video of some stadium worker who saw it happening. With all his creepy (there’s that word again) videotaping fixations, Belichick is like his own episode of Law & Order: SVU. Logan Mankins could have been one of the guys loading a truck at the beginning of the show while getting questioned by police. “Videotapes of the Jets. No, never heard anything about that. Sorry, gotta run, we have a shipment that’s already running late.” But back to Deflategate. Did that seriously happen during a game everyone was watching? Not that Belichick did it himself, but I’ve seen better cheating in my high-school math class … when I would lean over the goodie-goodie in front of me and ask my friend out loud what she got for No. 7. Marcel Marceau thinks Belichick should talk more. He gives one word answers at press conferences, messes around with injury reports and views the media as a nuisance, not as the way to hype the sport that pays him millions of dollars. Then again, this strategy it seems to be working just fine for him. Adam Vinatieri: Belichick savior. (USA TODAY Sports Images) Three Super Bowl wins: Two thanks to Adam Vinatieri’s right foot and one thanks, in large part, to Donovan McNabb’s gastrointestinal fortitude, or lack thereof. This isn’t to mention the Tuck Rule and Vinatieri’s miracle kick during that snowstorm in the 2001 divisional playoff against the Raiders. Belichick’s defenses are always great and he’s a magician at squeezing the best out of mediocre talent. (Remember when wide receiver Troy Brown used to play cornerback?) But when his teams win big games, it tends to be because of Tom Brady, a quarterback with whom Belichick has limited contact with during the week and games. We’re not privy to the inside workings of the Pats, but watch the coach on Sunday: He’ll sometimes be talking to the defense and have his back turned when the offense is on the field. So give me the two coaches who also have three Super Bowl wins, like Belichick. Joe Gibbs won three Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks (an underrated feat) and had full control of his offense. I’ll also take Bill Walsh who created his own offense. What did Belichick do? He watched Adam Vinatieri win him three Super Bowls. That’s not to say Belichick plays no role in the Pats’ and Brady’s greatness. He and the revolving door of offensive coordinators who have come through Foxborough set up the game plan every week. Belichick is very hands on, though Josh McDaniels or Charlie Weis or Bill O’Brien work with the offense and deserve more credit. But defense is still Belichick’s main focus. And those defenses lost fourth-quarter leaders in the last two Super Bowl losses to the New York Giants. Even Rich Kotite lasted longer. In case you forgot, Belichick was involved in that bizarre 1997 incident in which he was named a one-year coach of the Jets, keeping the seat warm for his mentor, Bill Parcells, who was barred by the New England Patriots from coaching that season. Eventually, Paul Tagliabue negotiated a settlement (a commissioner who makes decisive decisions — imagine that!) and Parcells got to coach New York. Belichick served as his assistant until the Pats hired him in 2000. This is Pete Carroll almost 20 years ago. (AP Photo/Jim Rogash) Carroll is the second-oldest coach in the NFL, behind Tom Coughlin, who looks old enough to have voted for Roosevelt (either one). Was Carroll the real-life inspiration for Twilight? Does he get the ol’ Hollywood treatments? Did he do what Ponce de Leon couldn’t? (Or are you a truther about the existence of the fountain of youth? And, no, we’re not even getting into that lunacy.) Look at it this way: Carroll, 63, is the same age as Star Wars hero Mark Hamill. The same age, I said. Carroll is always praising the Seahawks too-famous fans, but earlier this season he told them to “suck it up” after the team’s slow start. They would, but it’s too hard to concentrate with all that noise piping into CenturyLink Field. Five months before USC was slammed with sanctions stemming from a scandal involving Reggie Bush, the coach bolted for Seattle. That’s his prerogative — there were always whispers he wanted back in the NFL one day. But he didn’t just leave USC hanging, he sat there and watched as they were thrown off the building. He was John McClane and USC was Hans Gruber. But here’s the best part: Carroll says he never would have left had he known the NCAA sanctions were coming. Hell, *I* knew the NCAA sanctions were coming. Anyone with access to ESPN or a transistor radio knew the sanctions were coming. They were harsher than expected, but no one’s buying the fact that Carroll thinks USC was getting off with a strongly-worded letter. Still, Carroll told the Los Angeles Times he “would never have been able to leave under those circumstances,” referring to the major sanctions. Yeah, and all that noise at CenturyLink Field is natural. When those penalties were announced, Carroll said in a video statement that he was “absolutely shocked and disappointed in the findings of the N.C.A.A.” Yeah, the NCAA should have sucked it up, right?. (Also, who makes a video statement. You’re not Fidel Castro, bro.) Again, I harbor no ill-will for Carroll bailing. He’d have been an idiot to stay at USC with both penalties and an NFL offer pending. But don’t martyr yourself after the fact. Own your well-timed exit. No one likes that guy. Before he escaped from L.A., Carroll was criticized for going for a touchdown while up 21-7 with 54 seconds left. That didn’t bother some (myself included), because the opposing coach, Rick Neuheisel, had just called a timeout after USC’s Matt Barkley took a knee to end the game. If one team’s going to keep playing, the other is entitled to do the same. But what’s galling about this incident is that Carroll had just ripped Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh for doing the exact same thing a few weeks before. What’s good for the goose isn’t good for the arrogant, gray-haired gander. Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart played until they were seniors while Carroll was at USC, so when Mark Sanchez announced he was leaving after his junior season, Carroll was surprised but supported his player’s dream of playing in the NFL. Oh, no, my bad, he dumped all over the decision and acted like a petulant baby, even refusing to sit next to Sanchez at the press conference. There, he said through gritted teeth: “We’ve talked at great depth and great length. We’ve covered this from A to Z … going until late last night. We don’t see this decision the same. [But] I’m thrilled for Mark. For any of our kids to live the dream and do what they want to do with their football career, this is a great place to do this. […] In happier times, when Carroll played Sanchez and the Eagles. (US ATODAY Sports Images) And then a few minutes later: “We have compelling information working against the choice going this way.” It’s one thing to advise a player privately to stay in school. It’s fine to sit at the press conference and act as if this isn’t a time to celebrate. But it’s an another thing to bash said player while he’s sitting six feet away. The coaches in 2005. (Getty Images) Ugh, this is so hard. It’s like going to a restaurant where the only items on the menu are haggis and Arby’s, then following it up with a movie at a theater only showing an Adam Sandler movie or something starring Johnny Depp in a fake mustache. I’d rather listen to a three-hour Kanye West rant about fame, media, police, Autotune, haters and unfair demonization than choose between Bill Belichick or Pete Carroll. But I have to choose one. I owe that to you, the reader. So, since both guys have done some sleazy things, at least Bill Belichick doesn’t defend them with half-truths and an attempt at self-martyrdom. He doesn’t care what you think.

The use of the phrase \\"relic from a bygone era\\" suggests that the reviewer perceives the movie as being outdated, implying that it hasn't aged well or that it fails to resonate with contemporary audiences. The term \\"convolutions\\" in the sentence suggests that the reviewer finds the movie's plot or structure to be unnecessarily complex or difficult to follow.

By stating that the film's convolutions feel silly, the reviewer is essentially saying that the movie is not credible or relatable within its narrative.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What two groups made up the typical ballet audience? ? At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element\\".

News article: Aston Magna opens with Bach family affair The son got top billing, but there was never a real question who the family superstar was at the Aston Magna Music Festival opener. “C.P.E. Bach 300th Birthday Celebration and J.S. Bach’s ‘A Musical Offering’,” performed Thursday at Brandeis University, featured three works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-88) and one by his father, Johann Sebastian (1685-1750). That last one brought the audience to laughter and cheers. The concert kicked off the 42d summer season of the country’s longest-running festival performed on period instruments. Peter Sykes was on fortepiano throughout the night, teasing out a remarkable range of dynamics and color from the 18th-century version of the modern-day powerhouse. After providing two of the four voices in C.P.E. Bach’s Quartet in D major for Flute, Viola and Keyboard (the fourth is often played by cello), Sykes was joined by Aston Magna artistic director Daniel Stepner in the Fantasia for Harpsichord and Violin in F-sharp minor. Here was role reversal: Rather than the usual violinist-as-soloist to keyboard support, the fortepiano was the clear lead. The two played in tight synch navigating the darting musical interjections and meandering style Carl Philipp explored as he pulled away from his father’s sternly structured Baroque aesthetic toward a looser, more Romantic one. After C.P.E.’s Sonata in F major for Bass Recorder, Viola, and Continuo — a serving of rich sonorities between low instrumental voices — and intermission, it was time for Papa Bach’s “Musikalisches Opfer” (“Musical Offering”), based on a theme handed to him by Frederick II of Prussia. The stage filled with viola de gamba, Baroque flute, and two violins/viola, which attacked the parade of canons, fugue, and chromatic intrigue. This was organic, bare-knuckle playing, with pulsing tempos and intonation that has little in common with today’s digitally mastered uniformity. The audience responded with chuckles at impish movement endings, and gasps at virtuosic flourishes. The patriarch ruled. Four 2014 Aston Magna festival programs remain, each to be performed at Brandeis and two other venues: Winds of Romanticism, June 26-28; Music From a Turbulent 17th Century England, July 3-5; Vice Squad: Baroque Skirmishes with Alcohol, Tobacco, Coffee and Love, July 10-12; and Italian Trio Sonatas and a New Work, “Aston Magna,” by Nico Muhly, July 17-19.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.

Carson has forgiven the men and Aubrey's mom, which shows that he has let go of any resentment or anger he may have felt. 2. The reason for Carson's forgiveness is the fact that they talked about his personal life. While this may have upset Carson, his decision to forgive indicates a level of maturity and understanding. 3. The possible answers provided are: be a good guy, get revenge, or move on. 4. Given Carson's decision to forgive, it is unlikely that he would seek revenge, as forgiveness suggests Carson has chosen to not hold a grudge against the men and Aubrey's mom. 5. Considering Carson's ability to forgive, it is reasonable to assume that he would want to either \\"be a good guy\\" or \\"move on\\" from the situation. 6. Forgiving someone is often associated with being a good person, as it takes understanding and empathy. Moving on can also be seen as a positive action, as it shows emotional growth and self-awareness. 7.

In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas. - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty .

Gerry and Joe leave the injured man a blanket, a canteen and a gun before driving off, supposedly to seek medical aid. As the hours go by and Carson realizes the truth of his predicament, he vows to live long enough to exact revenge against his wife and her accomplice. Carson is reported missing to police lieutenant Mike Platt and to Dave Emory, who is Carson's lawyer and business manager. Gerry doesn't mention the broken leg and claims her husband wandered off. Emory isn't yet too concerned because Carson is a temperamental alcoholic who has acted irresponsibly more than once. The lovers fly to Carson's mansion in Los Angeles knowing that Carson is a good 60 miles from where they told the police to look. They expect him to succumb to the desert heat or to shoot himself with the gun. Far more resourceful than they anticipated, Carson manages to make a splint, then crawl his way to an abandoned mine, where he uses timber for a makeshift crutch. He finds sustenance from the meat of a cactus and attempts in vain to shoot a rabbit with the gun. When it rains, after Carson has been gone a week, Gerry and Joe are relieved because it has permanently covered any tracks they left. Carson is presumed dead by the law. Joe flies a plane over the region, just in case, and spots a fire Carson has made. Knowing now he's alive, Joe finds it necessary to drive back into the desert and finish off Carson once and for all.

George Tzavellas, also rendered Giorgos Tzavellas, Yiorgos Tzavellas, or Yorgos Javellas (Greek: Γιώργος Τζαβέλλας , 1916, Athens – October 18, 1976), was a Greek film director, screenwriter, and playwright. His filmmaking was particularly influential, with critic Georges Sadoul considering him \\"one of the three major postwar Greek directors\\" (along with Michael Cacoyannis and Nikos Koundouros). Can we infer the following? Georges Sadoul did not consider Nikos Koundouros to be a major director.","completion":"No, we cannot infer that Georges Sadoul did not consider Nikos Koundouros to be a major director. On the contrary, the information given indicates that Sadoul identified Koundouros as one of the three major postwar Greek directors, alongside George Tzavellas and Michael Cacoyannis. Hence, Sadoul must have held Koundouros in high esteem within the filmmaking industry. Georges Sadoul was a renowned French film historian and film critic who had a highly influential voice in international cinema. His assessment indicates that he considered Tzavellas, Cacoyannis, and Koundouros to be the three key figures in Greek cinema in the postwar era. Thus, Koundouros must have had a significant impact on Greek film direction and screenwriting, leading to be mentioned as one of the three major directors by Sadoul. Nikos Koundouros's inclusion in this distinguished trio suggests that he was considered a major player in the shaping of Greek cinema's unique style and aesthetic. His works, in tandem with those of Tzavellas and Cacoyannis, embodied a particular vision of modern Greek cinema that evidently left a indelible mark on film spectators and critics like Sadoul. In summary, the original statement is a reflection on their influence in Greek cinema industry during the postwar era. Koundouros, as well as Tzavellas and Cacoyannis, were major contributors in this sphere, as assessed by Georges Sadoul. The statement doesn't imply that Sadoul didn't consider Koundouros as a major director. Instead, Koundouros was deemed notable enough to be spotlighted as one of the three major postwar Greek directors."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. The sentence that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence, whereas the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an execution. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes or capital offences, and they commonly include offences such as murder, treason, espionage, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.

What is the answer: Which British city has cathedrals dedicated to St Philip and St Chad?","completion":"The British city with cathedrals dedicated to St Philip and St Chad is Birmingham. Birmingham, a major city in England's West Midlands region, possesses two cathedrals, each dedicated to a different saint, namely St Philip and St Chad. St Philip's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral that serves as the seat of the bishop of the Diocese of Birmingham. It was originally built as a parish church, and it was only later designated as a cathedral in 1905 upon the creation of the new diocese. The church of St Philip was founded by the prominent local landowner Thomas Archer and designed by Thomas Archer and the construction started in 1711 and was completed in 1715. The church was built in the Baroque style, with a prominent tower and a copper-clad dome, featuring ornate stone carvings and impressive stained glass windows designed by Edward Burne-Jones later in the 19th century. St Chad's Cathedral, which is dedicated to St Chad, is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in nearby proximity to St Philip’s. It was designed by Augustus Pugin, an early pioneer of the British Gothic Revival architectural style. The construction of the cathedral began in 1839, and it was completed in 1841. It became the first Catholic cathedral built in Britain after the Reformation. The Gothic style is clearly visible in the cathedral's design, with an elongated nave surrounded by narrow aisles, pointed arches, and tall slender columns. The cathedral features a square tower, adorned with a highly decorated interior and splendid windows. Both cathedrals are celebrated for their unique architectural styles and rich histories. Together, they contribute greatly to the cultural and historical landscape of the city of Birmingham, attracting tourists and history enthusiasts from around the world.

Mosquitofish: surprisingly violent. Credit: Shutterstock Despite what you might think, evolution rarely happens because something is good for a species. Instead, natural selection favours genetic variants that are good for the individuals that possess them. This leads to a much more complicated and messy world, with different selective forces pushing in many directions, even within a single species. One prominent consequence of this is \\"sexual conflict\\". This is the term evolutionary biologists use when one sex evolves a feature that gives benefits to the sex carrying it, but disadvantages the other sex, which in turn develops its own adaptations to counter this. Sexual conflict seems to explain some of the most bizarre manifestations of reproductive biology that we know of. The enormous, curly penises of some duck species or the tendency of male bed bugs to punch holes in their partners' abdominal walls to inseminate them are good examples of this. Now a new study has suggested that, in some species, this conflict between the sexes can have some surprising results. Specifically, avoiding conflict with males can cause females to evolve bigger brains. To understand the effects of sexual conflict, sometimes it can help to think about evolution in other antagonistic systems. In 2010, Japanese researcher Michio Kondoh showed that brain size evolution can depend on predator-prey conflicts. Both avoiding predators and catching prey demand brain power. By studying several hundred species of fish, Kondoh showed that prey eaten by large-brained predators tend to have larger brains themselves. It seems that both predator and prey tend to evolve towards higher cognitive functioning to give themselves an edge in their competition. Recently, a team of Swedish and Australian researchers led by Séverine Buechel from Stockholm University, noticed that predator-prey conflict is, in some ways, like sexual conflict. This is because it features two antagonistic partners constantly evolving to better outwit the other. The researchers wondered if, like predator-prey conflict, sexual conflict might also affect the evolution of brain size. To test this idea, they carried out a laboratory evolution experiment using a fish called the eastern mosquitofish, a relative of the guppy originally found in the Southern US. Male mosquitofish are particularly unpleasant. Unlike many fish, these animals reproduce by fertilising eggs inside the female's body. But instead of wooing a female and trying to impress her with his prowess, the male mosquitofish simply sneaks up on her and tries to force her to mate. The male fertilises the female's eggs using a tubular structure called a gonopodium, a modified anal fin that the male attempts to insert into the unwilling female. Not to put too fine a point on it, it's basically rape. Unsurprisingly, this is not good for the females, who are continually being harassed and have little control over the parenthood of their own offspring. Beuchel and her colleagues bred lines of fish where the males either had especially long gonopodia or especially short ones, as well as control lines where they didn't select for gonopodia size. Those with longer gonopodia would have an advantage in their attempts at coercive mating and so experience greater levels of sexual conflict. After nine generations of evolution in the laboratory, the researchers measured the sizes of the brains of the male and female fish from all their selection lines and from unselected control lines. They found that in the lines where males were selected to have longer gonopodia, the females had evolved larger brains that were around 6% heavier than the brains of females from the other lines. Bigger brains, better reproduction What seems to be happening is that, when sexual conflict is most intense, females who can use their brains to avoid coercive mating are actually the most successful at reproducing. This could be because these clever females are harassed less and can get on with things like feeding, or because they are better able to select the best quality males to father their offspring. These results suggest that conflict between the sexes can, at least in this case, cause the evolution of larger brains. But how general might this process be? Species where the males are this boorish and aggressive towards females are, thankfully, infrequent, and there are plenty other important evolutionary factors which can also lead to the evolution of bigger brains. For example, living in large, complicated social groups seems to require bigger brains (the so-called \\"social brain hypothesis\\"). In particular, trying to understand human intelligence in terms of sexual conflict would be premature and could lead to some very unwelcome misunderstandings. Having said that, low-level sexual conflict is not rare in the animal kingdom. So we might well have to look more closely at the battle of the sexes if we want a full understanding of the evolution of big brains.

Artificial selection on male genitalia length alters female brain size, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences (2016). DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2016.1796 ||||| Male mosquitofish with bigger genitals are typically best at coercing females into the \\"sack,\\" but now researchers have found that females that are not interested in such pushy lovers grow bigger brains to fight back. Having more brain power may give the females the smarts they need to find clever ways of avoiding male assaults, researchers said. This is just one example of the arms race that takes place between the sexes. The conflict arises in the animal kingdom because of the different strategies that males and females often take when it comes to continuing their genetic legacies. Females of most species are typically seen as choosy about their mates, because they often have to pay a high biological price for bearing offspring. On the other hand, sex usually exacts a low biological toll on males, so an approach that they frequently pursue is to mate as often as possible. [The 7 Weirdest Animal Penises] To learn more about the consequences of sexual conflict, researchers investigated the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a tiny fish that is native to the eastern and southern United States. Unlike most of the rest of the animal kingdom, in this species, males do not generally court females. Instead, male eastern mosquitofish usually try to force themselves upon females, making up to 1,000 attempts per day. Previous research has found that male eastern mosquitofish with larger gonopodiums (a modified fin that's the fish equivalent of a penis) are better at coercing females into sex than their less-endowed counterparts. Prior work that was published in 2010 in the journal Functional Ecology has also revealed that prey species often have relatively larger brains than their predators — likely in order to escape their hunters. Perhaps, in order to avoid such coercion from males with oversized genitals (the \\"predators\\" in this scenario), female eastern mosquitofish would develop larger brains, the researchers surmised. The researchers bred two different groups of male eastern mosquitofish: one was chosen for large genitals, and the other for small genitals. Females that were born in each group only mated with males of their group. [See Photos of a Weird 'Penis Head' Fish] After eight generations of breeding, the large-genital males had private parts that averaged about 6.4 millimeters long, while those of the small-genital males averaged only about 5.8 mm long. (In comparison, the average body size of both groups of males was 22.18 mm.) The researchers then paired each of the 30 to 40 small- and large-genital males with two virgin females (upping the chances the males would sire offspring). The female offspring from each group were then raised (10 females for one male) with a male from their group, so offspring with big-genital fathers would be raised with other big-genital males from the same genetic line. The scientists found that females in the group bred for larger male genitals had brains that were on average 4.6 percent heavier than their wild counterparts, and 6.5 percent heavier than females in the group that was bred for smaller male genitals. The brains of the males did not undergo such changes in either group. \\"We did not expect to find that female, but not male, brain size increased in lines selected for a longer gonopodium,\\" said study lead author Séverine Buechel, an evolutionary biologist at Stockholm University. \\"We expected both evading a male and pursuing a female to be cognitively demanding, and we therefore expected male coercion to select for larger brains in both sexes.\\" All in all, \\"the mating system adopted by a species is an important factor shaping male and female brain anatomy,\\" Buechel told Live Science. \\"We hope that this study provides a prospect for future research on brain evolution in relation to different mating strategies.\\" Buechel and her colleaguesdetailed their findings online Nov. 23 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

In ancient India, literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted. Early genres included drama, fables, sutras and epic poetry. Sanskrit literature begins with the Vedas, dating back to 1500–1000 BCE, and continues with the Sanskrit Epics of Iron Age India. The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts. The Samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500–1000 BCE, and the \\"circum-Vedic\\" texts, as well as the redaction of the Samhitas, date to c. 1000-500 BCE, resulting in a Vedic period, spanning the mid 2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE, or the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age.

The correct answer is option 4, which discusses the preferred way to strap pads for butterfly goalies, focusing on the pads' position and the ease of creating a \\"wall\\" of padding. Option 1 is incorrect because it discusses mountain top pads and zip/crawl bandages, which are not related to ice hockey or making a butterfly save.

As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.

Image copyright MicroCHIPS Image caption The chip would need replacing every 16 years (chip pictured is not the one described in the article) A contraceptive computer chip that can be controlled by remote control has been developed in Massachusetts. The chip is implanted under a woman's skin, releasing a small dose of levonorgestrel, a hormone. This will happen every day for 16 years, but can be stopped at any time by using a wireless remote control. The project has been backed by Bill Gates, and will be submitted for pre-clinical testing in the US next year - and possibly go on sale by 2018. The device measures 20mm x 20mm x 7mm and will be \\"competitively priced\\", its creators said. Convenience factor Tiny reservoirs of the hormone are stored on a 1.5cm-wide microchip within the device. A small electric charge melts an ultra-thin seal around the levonorgestrel, releasing the 30 microgram dose into the body. There are other types of contraceptive implant available, the researchers noted, but all require a trip to a clinic and an outpatient procedure in order to be deactivated. Someone across the room cannot re-programme your implant Dr Robert Farra \\"The ability to turn the device on and off provides a certain convenience factor for those who are planning their family,\\" said Dr Robert Farra from MIT. The next challenge for the team is to ensure the absolute security of the device to prevent activation or deactivation by another person without the woman's knowledge. \\"Communication with the implant has to occur at skin contact level distance,\\" said Dr Farra. \\"Someone across the room cannot re-programme your implant. \\"Then we have secure encryption. That prevents someone from trying to interpret or intervene between the communications.\\" Huge range The same technology could be used to administer other drugs. Simon Karger, head of the surgical and interventional business at Cambridge Consultants, said that implanted technology like this faces a range of challenges and risks. But he added that overall \\"the value to the patient of these types of implant can be huge and we foresee a future in which a huge range of conditions are treated through smart implanted systems\\". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Implanted devices could help people who forget to take medication at the correct time The innovation comes at a time when governments and organisations around the world have agreed to try to bring family planning to around 120 million more women by 2020. This challenge opens the door to this kind of implant technology being used in areas where access to traditional contraceptives is limited - a bigger priority, argued Gavin Corley, a biomedical engineer. \\"That's a humanitarian application as opposed to satisfying a first-world need,\\" he told the BBC. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC ||||| Women in ancient times are known to use acacia leaves, lint and honey to block sperm as a method of birth control but this rudimentary method of preventing pregnancy has gone a long way with the advent of new and more effective means of contraception available today including the use of pills, patches and intrauterine device (IUD). Yet it appears that there are still more room for improvement when it comes to contraceptives. A startup based in Lexington, Massachusetts is developing a new method of birth control that is too futuristic when compared with using leaves, lint and honey. The company is developing a contraceptive implant that is made up of a fertility chip that can be controlled using a remote control. MicroCHIPS, which specializes in long-term implantable drug delivery technology, has come up with a birth control chip that is implanted under the skin of the upper arm, abdomen or buttocks, and can be turned on and off using a wireless remote control. \\"Microchips' technology is based on proprietary reservoir arrays that are used to store and protect potent drugs within the body for long periods of time,\\" MicroCHIPs explained its technology on its website. \\"Individual device reservoirs can be opened on demand or on a predetermined schedule to precisely control drug release or sensor activation.\\" The device, which measures, 20 x 20 x 7 millimeters, dispenses 30 micrograms of the hormone levonorgestrel, which is also used in other contraceptive products, per day. The dosage, however, can be adjusted remotely by doctors. Unlike with women using other birth control implants such as IUD who need to see their doctor to have the device removed when they feel ready to conceive, women with the implanted fertility chip could simply turn it off using the remote control should they feel ready to have a baby. They can turn it on again if they do not wish to get pregnant. MicroCHIPS' fertility chip is also designed for long term use. While there are currently no hormonal birth control that lasts longer than five years, the device is designed to last up to 16 years after which it could be removed. Although the high tech contraceptive device is still under development, it is being readied for preclinical testing next year with the objective of making it available for public use by 2018. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the development of the device under its Family Planning program.

Rafferty, however, had different ideals and priorities when it came to love and marriage. Step 1: Understand the context and characters in the text The text mentions Rafferty's auntie Claire, who had been focused on her children's futures and happiness after being persuaded by his uncle's passionate courting. Rafferty, the protagonist, was grateful that marrying one of Claire's daughters wasn't in her plans. Rafferty's mother also had strong ambitions for her children, which may include appropriate marriages. Step 2: Determine the direction that needs to be developed in the narration Rafferty's unease comes from his conflict with his mother over her expectations regarding love and marriage. This conflict should be elaborated upon while maintaining the relationships established in the original text. Step 3: Develop the text by adding details to the characters and their relationships In order to provide more depth to the story, additional information should be included about Rafferty's relationship with his mother, how he handles her expectations, and what his own views and values are when it comes to love and marriage. Continuing the text: Rafferty found himself walking a tightrope between respecting his mother's desires and staying true to his own beliefs about relationships. He had never been one to follow the traditional path in life, preferring to forge his own way and seek out experiences that brought him happiness and fulfillment. The prospect of entering into a marriage out of familial obligation did not sit well with him, and he hoped that his mother would eventually come to understand and accept his viewpoint. As time wore on, Rafferty continued pursuing his passions and navigating the complex world of relationships on his own terms. He found solace in knowing that his auntie Claire had come around to the idea of her children forging their own paths, and he hoped that his mother would ultimately see the wisdom in this approach as well. Rafferty yearned for a love that was genuine, a partnership built on trust and mutual respect, rather than a union born from the ambitions of another. Despite the pressure he felt from his family, Rafferty knew that he owed it to himself to follow his heart and remain steadfast in his convictions. Only then, he believed, would he find the lasting and meaningful connection he sought. And perhaps, in the end, his mother would come to understand that her son's happiness was the ultimate ambition worth pursuing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the most sensical answer between \\"icy rain\\" and \\"slight wind\\"? Answer:","completion":"To determine the most sensical answer between \\"icy rain\\" and \\"slight wind,\\" let's analyze the two options: A) More resistance This option suggests that the firefly has more difficulty flying through the icy rain as compared to the slight wind. Icy rain implies the presence of heavier water particles, which can dampen the firefly's wings and bog it down, making it hard for the firefly to fly. In this case, more resistance would be logical when comparing the icy rain to the slight wind. B) Less resistance This option suggests that the firefly has an easier time flying through the slight wind. A slight wind is generally a milder and less obstructive force than icy rain. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that a firefly would experience less resistance when gliding through a slight wind compared to attempting to fly through icy rain conditions. Considering both options, the most sensical answer between \\"icy rain\\" and \\"slight wind\\" is the slight wind because it has less resistance compared to the icy rain.

In Green Mythology which god gave Perseus his winged sandals? What is the answer?","completion":"In Greek mythology, the god who provided Perseus with his winged sandals was Hermes. Hermes, also known as the messenger of the gods, was the son of Zeus and Maia and the deity associated with travel, communication, commerce, and cunning. He was known for his agility and speed, which was symbolized by his winged sandals, called Talaria. Perseus, a demigod and the son of Zeus and Danae, was given a challenging task to complete. He was ordered to bring the head of Medusa, one of the Gorgons, back to King Polydectes. The Gorgons were three monstrous sisters - Medusa, Stheno, and Euryale. Among them, Medusa was the only mortal and had the terrifying ability to turn anyone who directly gazed into her eyes into stone. It was a daunting mission that would test Perseus's courage and resourcefulness. To aid him in his quest, the gods supported Perseus by providing him with tools and advice. Each god bestowed upon him an essential item. From Athena, the goddess of wisdom and warfare, Perseus received a mirrored shield, through which he could indirectly observe Medusa without being turned to stone. Meanwhile, Hermes contributed the winged sandals, which granted Perseus the ability to fly and navigate through the heavens. Additionally, he was given a magical helm of invisibility by Hades, the god of the underworld, and a sharp, adamantine sickle provided by Hephaestus, the god of fire and craftsmanship. Using these divine gifts, Perseus managed to evade the dangers he encountered on his journey, eventually reaching the lair of the Gorgons. With his winged sandals, he was able to hover above the ground, avoiding the Gorgons' snake-like hair and gaze. Perseus ultimately succeeded in his mission, beheading Medusa by using Athena's mirrored shield to guide his strike. In conclusion, it was Hermes who granted Perseus the winged sandals to support him in his quest to defeat Medusa. These sandals permitted Perseus to fly and maneuver swiftly, an ability that was essential for his success.

Jordanes in Getica recounts \`\` For this Attila was the son of Mundzucus , whose brothers were Octar and Ruas , who were supposed to have been kings before Attila , although not altogether of the same ( territories ) as he '' . - De origine actibusque Getarum (\\"\\"The Origin and Deeds of the Getae/Goths\\"\\"), or the Getica, written in Late Latin by Jordanes (or \\"Iordanes/Jornandes\\") in or shortly after 551 AD, claims to be a summary of a voluminous account by Cassiodorus of the origin and history of the Gothic people, which is now lost. However, the extent to which Jordanes actually used the work of Cassiodorus is unknown. It is significant as the only remaining contemporaneous resource that gives the full story of the origin and history of the Goths. Another aspect of this work is its information about the early history and the customs of Slavs. - Attila (or ; fl. circa 406453), frequently referred to as Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the Huns from 434 until his death in March 453. Attila was a leader of the Hunnic Empire, a tribal confederation consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others, on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe. - The Huns were a nomadic people who lived in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia between the 1st century AD and the 7th century AD. As per European tradition, they were first reported living east of the Volga River, in an area that was part of Scythia at the time; the Huns' arrival is associated with the migration westward of a Scythian people, the Alans. In 91 AD, the Huns were said to be living near the Caspian Sea and by about 150 had migrated southeast into the Caucasus. By 370, the Huns had established a vast, if short-lived, dominion in Europe. - Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator (c. 485 c. 585), commonly known as Cassiodorus, was a Roman statesman and writer serving in the administration of Theoderic the Great, king of the Ostrogoths. \\"Senator\\" was part of his surname, not his rank. - Uldin, also spelled Huldin (died before 412), was one of the primary Hunnic rulers mentioned by name. - Rugila or Ruga (also Ruas; died second half of the 430s AD), was a ruler who was a major factor in the Huns early victories over the Roman Empire. He served as an important forerunner with brother Octar, with whom initially ruled in dual kingship, possibly a geographical division where Rugila ruled over Eastern Huns while Octar over Western Huns, during the 5th century AD.

Summarize this article: Update: On Nov. 9, Apple released a new update – iOS 11.1.1 – which fixes the autocorrect error. If you're still having this issue, be sure to update your phone by tapping Settings > General > Software Update. If you're anything like me, when you first realized that your iPhone was autocorrecting the letter \\"i\\" to the letter \\"a\\" and a question mark in a box, you spent a solid three minutes laughing hysterically and texting it to friends. After those 10 minutes, though, a deeper existential dread began to set in: was it possible that I did something so irrevocably dumb that my iPhone was going to be messed up forever? And how the hell did I even begin to Google the problem that I was having when I didn't really understand it myself? A quick scan of social media only made matters worse; some people seemed to be wholly unaware that they were sending symbol-laden gibberish into the void, and those who were aware of the bug were at a complete loss for how to fix it. Was this our new normal? Did we miss a memo on just what it is that the letter \\"i\\" now came to represent? Thankfully, the good people of Apple came through with an anguish-zapping fix that magically changes our iPhones back to normal. And even better, it couldn't possibly be easier. ADVERTISEMENT Here's what you've got to do to return your \\"i\\" back to its normal state of existence, according to Apple Support's suggested method of \\"Try setting up Text Replacement for the letter 'i'\\": 1. Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement. 2. Tap +. 3. For Phrase, type an upper-case \\"I\\". For Shortcut, type a lower-case \\"i.\\" Once you've completed these three easy steps, you will quickly find that the anxiety brought on by a sentient autocorrect has dissipated. And if you want an extra boost for your mood, I highly recommend getting rid of the worst autocorrect that ever existed — \\"OMW/On my way!\\" — while you're already in your settings. I promise you won't regret it, and your friends will likely thank you for it later. ||||| Apple Messages is one of the iPhone's killer apps, streamlining text messages and making the iPhone almost impossible to abandon — but texting is infuriating if all the letters don't actually work. SEE ALSO: How to clean up your iPhone storage in iOS 11 We became privy to a new iPhone keyboard glitch after a few Mashable staffers recently started having issues with their iPhone keyboards, specifically with vowels. The issue started when iOS 11's predictive text feature began to display an odd character in the place of the letter \\"I,\\" offering up \\"A[?] instead and autocorrecting within the message field. The people were running iOS 11.0.3 and 11.1, using iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. Image: Emily DeCicco/screenshot The bug was also covered by MacRumors, but it appears that my colleagues have even more issues than just the letter \\"I.\\" One reported that they were also seeing the glitch with the letters \\"U\\" and \\"O\\" as well, making the problem strictly restricted to vowels. They also said the letters showed up oddly in iMessage on Mac devices, and shared some more screenshots of what the glitch looks like when they went through with sending a message. Image: emily decicco/screenshot The glitch wasn't just limited to iMessage, however. My colleagues shared screenshots of their increasingly futile attempts to type out messages on Facebook Messenger... Image: emily decicco/screenshot ... and Twitter. Image: emily decicco/screenshot MacRumors reported that the glitch can be bypassed by using third-party keyboards or turning off the predictive text feature in the iPhone's keyboard settings, but we didn't get the same result when we tested the solutions here at Mashable HQ. The glitch persists. We reached out to Apple to get to the bottom of the keyboard issues, but haven't heard back. Until the bug is patched, my colleagues and all of their friends will have to communicate without vowels. ||||| Glitch in predictive text system making messages illegible for some iPhone, iPad and Mac users, while Apple Watch bug crashes when asking for the weather A bizarre predictive text error has left some iPhone users unable to type the word “I”. Instead, every time they attempt to use the English first-person pronoun, it gets replaced by the letter A and an unprintable unicode character, typically rendered as a question mark in a box, but occasionally five horizontal bars instead. The error first surfaced almost a week ago, as scattered reports of the problem hit social media and the specialist press. It appears to affect users of iOS 10 and iOS 11, and has also been reported as happening to users of Apple’s Mac computers too. The bug seems to be related to Apple’s cloud-based synchronisation for predictive text – a relatively recent feature that allows users’ dictionaries to be shared using its iCloud service. When the phone learns a novel autocorrection, such as the name of a new contact, it will be shared with other devices owned by the same person. Apple also uses machine learning to identify new words that are being used by its customers – for example, the name “Harambe”, which entered common usage after the shooting of a gorilla in Cincinnati Zoo – and syncs those words to iOS and macOS devices. As well as the autocorrect, a number of other related problems seem to be hitting iOS devices. Some users have reported that a lower-case “i” character is appearing in the emoji picker, while others are seeing the strange unicode character where a normal “I” is written. Apple declined to comment, referring the Guardian to a support article offering a temporary workaround using the iOS text replacement settings to replace all uses of a lowercase i with a capital. It may be grammatically incorrect, but at least it will be legible. Daylight savings crash Users of Apple’s watchOS have avoided the predictive text bug, by virtue of not having a keyboard, but have fallen prey to their own odd error over the last few weeks: a hard crash of the device when asked for the weather. Through trial and error, some worked out the likely culprit of the reset: daylight savings time. When an Apple watch running watchOS 4 is asked for the current weather in a location where the clocks are going back in the next 24 hours, it crashes. Daylight savings is always tricky for developers, and Apple has a long history of minor errors caused by the clocks changing. In 2010, iPhone alarms failed to update after the clocks changed, resulting in a lot of flustered people arriving late to work. In 2011, some US iPhones managed to update the time, but in the wrong direction, falling back when they should have sprung forward. In between those two, iPhone alarms also failed completely on New Year’s Day 2011. ||||| Helpful? Yes No Thanks - please tell us how to help you better.

As Ennis's musical talents begin to attract attention from local music scouts, he becomes consumed by the prospect of a meaningful career. But instead of letting music heal him, Ennis's newfound success only highlights the void in his life, pushing him to desperately seek a way to bridge the emotional distance between him and Lureen. Ennis takes it upon himself to find Lureen, using information gleaned from their conversations. Tracing her to an isolated cabin in the mountains, a tense yet emotional reunion occurs. The connection between them is just as palpable in person, and they learn of each other's secrets and heartbreak firsthand.

Given the following context: Handel's earliest opera compositions, in the German style, date from his Hamburg years, 1704–06, under the influence of Johann Mattheson. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 Carnevale season. answer the following question: What is the name of the person that traveled to Italy in 1706?

The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers.

Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a rule Scripture establishes: faith, competency or practice?\\" is competency. The passage mentions \\"salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice,\\" suggesting that faith and practice are rules established by Scripture. However, it refers to \\"soul competency (liberty),\\" without linking it directly to Scripture, indicating that it might not be a rule established by Scripture.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: You can't always know when there'll be a heavy rain or when to take an umbrella with you. But designer Mikhail Belyaev doesn't think that forgetting to check the weather report before going out should cause you to get wet in the rain. That's why he created the Lampbrella--a lamp post with its own \\"umbrella\\". The designer says he came up with the idea after watching people get wet on streets in Russia. \\"Once, I was driving on a central Saint Petersburg street and saw people trying to hide from the rain under the street lamps. I thought it would be a good idea to have a Lampbrella built into a street lamp.\\" he said. The Lampbrella is a street lamp fitted with an umbrella canopy . It has an inside electric motor which can open or close the umbrella freely. The Lampbrella will offer people cover whenever it starts raining. After three minutes of not being used the canopy is closed. According to the designer, the Lampbrella would move at a very low speed in order not to cause harm to people. What's more, it would be grounded to protect from a possible lightning hit. Each Lampbrella would offer enough cover for several people. Being 2 meters off the ground, it would only be a danger for the tallest man. While there are no plans to take the Lampbrella into production , Belyaev says he recently introduced his creation to one Moscow company, and insists his creation could be on any street where a lot of people walk but there are no canopies to provide cover.

Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"Warm, sheltered, south-facing pockets of land enable species which are less cold-tolerant to survive. In many regions across the globe, particularly those with seasonal variations in temperature and weather patterns, certain landscape features promote the survival of species that are less cold-tolerant. These areas are typically warm, sheltered, and south-facing pockets of land that benefit from the unique environmental conditions that result from their positioning, topography, and surrounding structures. One of the primary factors contributing to these unique conditions is the south-facing aspect of the lands. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes and areas receive more sunlight throughout the day compared to north-facing ones. This increased sun exposure results in higher soil temperatures, creating a more favorable microclimate for species sensitive to cold. Moreover, the sheltered nature of these pockets further enhances the habitability of these areas for less cold-tolerant species. Sheltered locations are often characterized by natural land formations such as valleys, hills, or forests that can provide protection from cold winds or insulate the area from fluctuating temperatures. In addition to natural features, human-made structures like greenhouses, walls, and buildings can also contribute to the sheltering effect. Another factor that contributes to making these pockets of land warm and habitable for less cold-tolerant species is the presence of microclimates. A microclimate is a small, localized area where the climate is different from its surrounding regions due to differences in sun exposure, topography, and other factors. These microclimates offer a more stable, warmer, and less variable environment, allowing less cold-tolerant species to survive and even thrive. Some examples of species that benefit from these warm, sheltered, south-facing pockets of land are various types of plants and flowers, which often bloom earlier in the season compared to their counterparts in less optimal environments. This increased growth and productivity can be particularly beneficial for agricultural practices or the creation of horticultural displays. Similarly, these habitats can also support insect and animal species that require consistent warmth, such as butterflies, reptiles, and amphibians. Moreover, this ability to harbor less cold-tolerant species can be beneficial for biodiversity and conservation efforts. The preservation of these warm, sheltered, south-facing pockets of land can contribute to providing vital ecological niches that sustain specific populations of plants and animals and maintain overall ecosystem health. In conclusion, warm, sheltered, south-facing pockets of land are essential for the survival of many less cold-tolerant species. The combination of increased sun exposure, sheltered conditions, and the presence of microclimates creates environments that support an array of diverse plant and animal life. By understanding the importance of these landscape features, we can better appreciate their role in supporting ecosystems and take the necessary steps to protect and preserve them for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: While applying to college may seem easy, getting in can be tough! When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee. . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college. Question: To make a list of colleges, you _ . Options: A: needn't consider about your ability B: had better take your academy into account C: are supposed to choose merely one most fit D: are required to pick out more than 30 colleges Answer:","completion":"B: had better take your academy into account"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: When the evidence is consistent, the analyst still cannot confirm the pattern. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as it presents a contrast in the criteria for confirming a pattern. Let's break down the two sentences and analyze their content to understand the difference between them. Sentence 1: When the evidence is more consistent than not, the analyst confirms the pattern and looks for others related to it. This sentence conveys that if evidence supports a specific pattern even marginally more than it contradicts it, an analyst can confirm the pattern and then search for other patterns that could be related to the confirmed one. The key here is that the evidence, although potentially having some inconsistencies, has a greater weight on the side of consistency. Sentence 2: When the evidence is consistent, the analyst still cannot confirm the pattern. In this sentence, the key point is that even when the evidence is consistent, which one would assume be sufficient for pattern confirmation, the analyst is still not able to confirm the pattern. This implies that there are other factors, apart from the consistency of evidence, that must be taken into account in order to confirm the pattern. From the information given in these two sentences, we can ascertain that they do not necessarily entail each other. The first sentence outlines criteria for pattern confirmation based on the evidence being more consistent than not, while the second sentence introduces an element of doubt by stating that even with consistent evidence, the analyst cannot confirm the pattern. This contrast suggests that the two sentences might refer to different types of patterns or varying levels of evidence required to confirm them. Alternatively, it could be indicating that factors other than consistency, such as relevance or context, play a crucial role in confirming a pattern. In either case, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as the relationship between evidence consistency and pattern confirmation is presented differently in each."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She had a tighter bond with the","completion":"cat since she had been the one to adopt it, nursing it back to health after it had suffered injuries from an accident, while he had always been more of a dog person, finding comfort and companionship in the loyal and protective presence of their canine companion. Over the years, their respective relationships with the pets had grown and evolved in unique and meaningful ways, reflecting their distinct personalities and the different ways they connected with their furry family members. From the very beginning, Lynn demonstrated a genuine love and concern for the vulnerable little kitten she had stumbled upon while volunteering at the local animal shelter. She had immediately felt a strong bond with the frightened, injured creature and knew she had to bring it home with her. Over the following weeks, she invested countless hours into the kitten's care, diligently administering medication, cleaning its wounds, and providing it with the warmth and nurturing it desperately needed. As the cat slowly regained its strength, its trust in Lynn grew, and an unbreakable bond was formed. On the other hand, Lynn's husband had always been drawn to dogs for their boundless energy, unwavering loyalty, and the sense of protection they offered. From the early days of their relationship, he had expressed a desire to adopt a dog to join their family, ultimately choosing a lovable and rambunctious breed that would suit their active lifestyle. Over time, the dog proved to be his perfect companion, always eager to accompany him on hikes, joining him for friendly games of fetch, and offering a faithful presence by his side during life's ups and downs. Considering the unique connection each of them shared with their respective pets, it was only natural that this division would come up during the divorce proceedings. Acknowledging their individual attachments, they both agreed that Lynn should be granted custody of the cat while her husband would take responsibility for the dog. This arrangement would not only provide the most stable and loving environments for the pets going forward, but also give each of them comfort and companionship in what would be an emotionally challenging time. Moreover, they were both committed to maintaining a healthy, civil relationship for the sake of their pets, understanding the significance of avoiding any unnecessary stress and upheaval. They respected the deep bonds that had formed between each of them and their cherished pets, recognizing that while their marriage was ending, the love and attachment they had developed with their beloved cat and dog could continue to be a source of solace and support in their separate lives. In the end, the proposal concerning the pets' custody in the divorce would serve as a testament to their mutual love, care, and understanding for the well-being of the pets, and perhaps, a small reminder of the shared compassion that had once formed the foundation of their life together."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sources say he was not prepared to be dictated to by the teams, so he did not present that option when the decision to change was put to a vote of the F1 Commission, which includes all teams, the FIA, F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone and representatives of the circuits, sponsors and tyre suppliers. Instead, Todt offered the choice of a slightly amended elimination format - with the first two sessions slightly extended and only the third session running as 2015 - or to stick with the new rules. McLaren, Red Bull, Toro Rosso and Force India all voted against the tweaks because it was not what had been agreed by the teams in Australia. Insiders say by doing so they hoped to force Todt to run a second vote with the option of reverting to 2015's format but this did not happen. Several drivers made the point that the fiasco underlined their reasons for writing an open letter last week pleading for F1's governance to be changed to stop decisions being made on the sport's future. Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, said he hoped the letter would lead to a \\"re-think of what is currently happening\\". He added: \\"Obviously it is clear if you write the letter it doesn't change tomorrow, we didn't give any proposals, we just made clear something is not right and something has to change. our intention was to really question our current situation and decision-making and hopefully improve that in the future.\\" Hamilton is one of a handful of drivers who are not members of the GPDA but he said the drivers were unanimously behind the letter.

Blood hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by the blood confined within blood vessels or heart chambers. Even more specifically, the pressure exerted by blood against the wall of a capillary is called capillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP), and is the same as capillary blood pressure. CHP is the force that drives fluid out of capillaries and into the tissues. As fluid exits a capillary and moves into tissues, the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid correspondingly rises. This opposing hydrostatic pressure is called the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (IFHP). Generally, the CHP originating from the arterial pathways is considerably higher than the IFHP, because lymphatic vessels are continually absorbing excess fluid from the tissues. Thus, fluid generally moves out of the capillary and into the interstitial fluid. This process is called filtration.

A:","completion":"The four types of light receptors in the human eye include three types of cone cells and one type of rod cells. Here is a detailed explanation of each type: 1. Cone Cells: Cone cells are responsible for detecting color and function best in well-lit conditions. There are three types of cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light, corresponding to red, green, and blue colors. a. L-cones: Long-wavelength cones, also known as red cones, are sensitive to longer wavelengths in the red end of the spectrum, around 564-580 nm. b. M-cones: Medium-wavelength cones, also known as green cones, are sensitive to medium wavelengths in the green part of the spectrum, around 534-545 nm. c. S-cones: Short-wavelength cones, also known as blue cones, are sensitive to shorter wavelengths in the blue part of the spectrum, around 420-440 nm. 2. Rod Cells: Rod cells are highly sensitive to low light levels and are responsible for vision in dimly lit conditions. They are not used for color perception but help detect the presence or absence of light, motion, and the outlines of objects. Rod cells are most sensitive to a wavelength of around 498 nm, which is in the green portion of the spectrum.

Answer a question about this article: Enlightenment era religious commentary was a response to the preceding century of religious conflict in Europe, especially the Thirty Years' War. Theologians of the Enlightenment wanted to reform their faith to its generally non-confrontational roots and to limit the capacity for religious controversy to spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining a true faith in God. For moderate Christians, this meant a return to simple Scripture. John Locke abandoned the corpus of theological commentary in favor of an \\"unprejudiced examination\\" of the Word of God alone. He determined the essence of Christianity to be a belief in Christ the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed debate. Thomas Jefferson in the Jefferson Bible went further; he dropped any passages dealing with miracles, visitations of angels, and the resurrection of Jesus after his death. He tried to extract the practical Christian moral code of the New Testament. Did John Locke want to foster or avoid increased detailed debate on the essence of Christianity?","completion":"John Locke wanted to avoid increased detailed debate on the essence of Christianity. His approach to religious interpretation during the Enlightenment era was to focus on an \\"unprejudiced examination\\" of the Word of God alone, essentially advocating for a return to simple Scripture. This was in response to the religious conflicts and controversies that had plagued Europe, particularly during the Thirty Years' War. Locke was interested in the reformation of Christian faith to its non-confrontational roots, attempting to limit religious disputes and their subsequent influence on politics and warfare. He believed that delving into detailed debates would only exacerbate existing tensions and controversies, ultimately detracting from the core values of Christianity. By determining the essence of Christianity to be a belief in Christ the redeemer, Locke emphasized the importance of a central, unifying belief for Christians. He discouraged further detailed debate, in hopes of maintaining harmony within the religious community while still enabling individuals to maintain their faith in God. In summary, John Locke sought to avoid increased detailed debate on the essence of Christianity to promote unity, prevent conflicts, and return the focus of religious practice to simple Scripture and core beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Broncos kicked off the 2015 season against the Baltimore Ravens, the Broncos' fifth-consecutive Week 1 home opener. Two first-quarter field goals by placekicker Brandon McManus &#8212; from 57 and 56 yards out &#8212; gave the Broncos the early 6-point advantage. In the second quarter, a 44-yard field goal by placekicker Justin Tucker got the Ravens on the scoreboard. McManus later countered with a 43-yard field goal just before halftime to put the lead back to 6. Three plays into the Broncos' initial possession of the second half, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Ravens' cornerback Jimmy Smith for a 24-yard touchdown, in what was the Ravens' only touchdown of the game. After forcing a Broncos' punt, the Ravens increased their lead, with a 44-yard field goal by Tucker. The Broncos were forced to punt on their next two third-quarter offensive possessions. With 10 seconds remaining in the third quarter, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with cornerback Aqib Talib returning an interception off Ravens' quarterback Joe Flacco 51 yards for a touchdown, in what was the Broncos' only touchdown of the game. The Broncos' defense forced the Ravens' to punt on their next possession early in the fourth quarter, and beginning at the 13:51 mark, the Broncos began a 17-play, 81-yard drive that devoured 10:51 off the clock, but had to settle for a 33-yard field goal by McManus to increase to a 19-13 lead. With 2:55 remaining in the game, the Ravens advanced to as far as the Broncos' 16-yard line, hoping for a game-winning touchdown. On the 14th play of the drive, a pass from Flacco to wide receiver Steve Smith, Sr. that was almost a touchdown was deflected by Broncos' cornerback Bradley Roby near the goal line, falling incomplete. On the next play, with 36 seconds remaining, a pass from Flacco intended for tight end Crockett Gilmore was intercepted by safety Darian Stewart in the end zone, sealing the Broncos' fourth consecutive Week 1 victory. NotesThis marked the first time since September 17, 2006, that the Broncos won a game without scoring an offensive touchdown.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Under normal conditions, in which organism the chemical reactions would be more plausible, organism A or organism B? Hint: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . The answer is:","completion":"Organism A. Under normal conditions, the chemical reactions in organism A would be more plausible compared to organism B. This is because organism A has enzymes, which are biological catalysts that help to speed up chemical reactions. As mentioned in the hint, most chemical reactions within organisms are too slow under the normal conditions within a cell. The body temperature, for instance, might be too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to support life processes. Additionally, the reactants in the cell may be present in such low concentrations that they rarely meet and collide, making the reaction rate very slow. Enzymes play a crucial role in addressing these challenges. They lower the activation energy needed for a reaction to occur, effectively enhancing the rate of the reaction. Enzymes work by binding to the reactants, known as substrates, and providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy. As a result, chemical reactions can proceed at a sufficient rate to support essential life processes, even in organisms with relatively low internal temperatures or low reactant concentrations. In contrast, organism B lacks enzymes, which means that it does not have the biological catalysts needed to accelerate its chemical reactions to an adequate rate. Consequently, the chemical reactions in organism B would be less plausible and less effective as compared to those in organism A, which has the necessary enzymes to speed up the reactions and sustain the organism's life processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years.

However, despite this significant milestone, no deal has yet been reached over the formation of a new government. The swearing-in ceremony, attended by various key political figures and members of the international community, highlighted the progress East Timor has made in recent years, especially in terms of democratic development. The event also underscored the challenges that lie ahead for the nation, particularly in terms of political stability, given the current lack of consensus on the formation of a government. The struggle to reach an agreement on government stems from the inconclusive results of the recent parliamentary elections, which did not give any one party a clear majority. Consequently, the various stakeholders have been engaged in negotiations to form a coalition government since the elections took place. However, despite several attempts to forge alliances and come to a consensus, no deal has been finalized yet. The continued political stalemate not only raises concerns about the stability of East Timor's fledgling democratic institutions but also has significant implications for its economic and social development. The lack of a functioning government could delay much-needed policy decisions and hamper efforts to address pressing issues such as poverty, unemployment, and underdevelopment. Nevertheless, the swearing-in of the Parliament is an important stepping stone for the people of East Timor. The nation's leaders now face the critical task of resolving their differences and forming a united government that can work together for the betterment of the country. It is imperative that these negotiations are carried out diligently and in good faith, with the well-being of the people of East Timor as their utmost priority. In conclusion, while the swearing-in of the East Timor Parliament is a momentous occasion, it also serves as a reminder of the challenges that lie ahead in terms of government formation.

Q: The young man who killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school Friday suffered from a condition where he could literally feel no pain, according to a faculty member at his old high school. Richard Novia, the advisor for the tech club at Newton High, said that if Adam Lanza cut or hurt himself, \\"he would not know it or feel it.\\" Novia's words are the latest from a series of former acquaintances of Lanza's to paint him as bright but obviously troubled. \\"Adam Lanza has been a weird kid since we were five years old,\\" wrote a neighbor and former classmate Timothy Dalton on Twitter. \\"As horrible as this was, I can't say I am surprised.\\" \\"[Adam] was not connected with the other kids,\\" said family friend Barbara Frey. A relative told ABC News that Adam was \\"obviously not well.\\" Mark Tambascio, another family friend, said he believed Lanza's mother, Nancy, had become increasingly concerned in the last few months about Lanza's emotional and behavioral issues. Lanza's parents divorced three years ago and his mother was left to deal Lanza alone. \\"It was getting a little harder for her as time went on,\\" he said. Divorce records obtained by ABC News revealed that Nancy was to \\"make all decisions\\" with respect to her son, but only after consulting with Lanza's father. The settlement awarded Nancy approximately a quarter million dollars a year in alimony but the documents do not mention any behavioral or mental health problems related to Adam Lanza. Kyle Kromberg, another former classmate, said that Lanza could not keep eye contact with anyone. \\"He hated looking at your eyes for more than a couple seconds,\\" Kromberg said. \\"He'd always look down at his papers or whatever he was doing.\\" A former babysitter, Ryan Kraft, said Nancy told him never to leave Adam alone -- \\"Never even to the bathroom or turn your back on him at any time.\\" On Friday morning, Lanza shot Nancy in the face at the home they shared in Newtown, and then drove her car to Sandy Hook Elementary School. Dressed in black combat gear, the 20-year-old broke a window at the school, which had recently had a new security system installed, and within minutes had shot and killed six adults and 20 schoolchildren between the ages of five and 10. Police said Lanza used a Bushmaster semiautomatic assault-style rifle to kill the children before using a handgun to take his own life. Officials said the guns were likely legally purchased by Nancy. Officials told ABC News that computers removed from Lanza's family home over the weekend provide important clues into Lanza's twisted thinking.

He participated when called on by the teacher in his evening course on introductory German, according to Dot Stasny, who was one of about a dozen other students in the class in the spring of 2009. She said she and a classmate once invited him out to a bar but he declined, saying he was only 17. \\"We attributed him being quiet to him being so much younger than the rest of us,\\" said Stasny, 30. \\"I assumed he was this super smart kid who was just doing extra course work.\\" Stasny said she saw him later when he came in as a customer at a video game store where she was working.

Lanza shot himself in the head when he heard police approaching the classroom where he was gunning down helpless children. He had multiple, high-capacity clips each capable of holding 30 bullets, and the chief medical examiner said the ammunition was the type designed to break up inside a victim's body and inflict the maximum amount of damage, tearing apart bone and tissue. The gunman shot his mother four times in the head before going to the school and gunning down 26 victims there. THE VICTIMS: All the victims at the school were shot multiple times with a high-power rifle, some of them up close. All six adults were women. Of the 20 children, eight were boys and 12 were girls. All the children were 6 or 7 years old. Among the dead were popular principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, who rushed toward Lanza in an attempt to stop him and paid with their lives; Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher who died while trying to hide her pupils; 30-year-old Lauren Rousseau, a teacher thrilled to have been hired this year, and Ana Marquez-Greene, a 6-year-old girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada. THE GUNMAN: Lanza was described as a bright but painfully awkward student who seemed to have no close friends. In high school, he was active in the technology club. The club adviser remembered that he had \\"some disabilities\\" and seemed not to feel pain like the other students. That meant Lanza required special supervision when using soldering tools, for instance. He also had an occasional \\"episode\\" in which he seemed to withdraw completely from his surroundings, the adviser said. Authorities said Lanza had no criminal history, and it was unclear whether he had a job. THE SCENE: Families sought to comfort each other during Sunday church services and vigils devoted to impossible questions like that of a 6-year-old girl who asked her mother: \\"The little children, are they with the angels?\\" Many of Newtown's 27,000 people wondered whether life could ever return to normal, and, as the workweek was set to begin, parents pondered whether to send their children back to school. Signs around town read, \\"Hug a teacher today,\\" \\"Please pray for Newtown\\" and \\"Love will get us through.\\" THE PARENTS: One of the parents who lost a child in the attack spoke publicly about his loss. Robbie Parker fought back tears and struggled to catch his breath as he described his 6-year-old daughter, Emilie, as a little girl who loved to draw. He also reserved surprisingly kind words for the gunman, saying he was not mad and offering sympathy for the gunman's family. To the man's family, he said, \\"I can't imagine how hard this experience must be for you.\\" THE GUNS: Federal authorities visited local gun ranges but found no evidence that the gunman trained for the attack or was an active member of the recreational gun community. Investigators also have interviewed gun dealers trying to determine whether there was any training or other behavior that precipitated the attack. THE HISTORY: The Newtown massacre is the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history and one of the deadliest mass shootings around the world. A gunman at Virginia Tech University killed 33, including himself, in 2007. Only Virginia Tech and the mass killings of 77 in Norway last year had greater death tolls across the world over the past 20 years. ||||| Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old who killed 20 children and six adults in a rampage at a Connecticut elementary school, and his mother both spent time at an area gun range, ABC News has learned. A Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokesperson told ABC News investigators have determined Lanza did visit a gun range, but they have not determined whether he shot there. Investigators have also learned his mother, Nancy Lanza, visited a gun range on multiple occasions, but they have not determined whether her son was with her during those visits, the spokesperson said. ATF agents have been canvassing area gun ranges and gun dealers to learn whether Adam Lanza had been a customer or a visitor. CLICK HERE for full coverage of the tragedy at the elementary school. Law enforcement sources tell ABC News that reports that the shooter recently attempted to purchase a gun at a local sporting goods store have not been substantiated at this time. Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle at close range to kill children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on Friday. Two handguns were also found at the scene, but law enforcement officials described the Bushmaster as the primary weapon. A fourth weapon was found nearby. The weapons discovered at the school apparently belonged to a family member, possibly his mother, according to authorities. Lanza, 20, forced his way into Sandy Hook on Friday morning and killed 20 children and six adults before committing suicide. He drove to the school after shooting his mother in the face at their home. The weapons that police recovered from the scene included a Glock 9-mm handgun, a Sig Sauer 9-mm handgun and a Bushmaster rifle. Police also found .223 shell casings. Lanza was wearing a bullet-proof vest. The shooter's mother, 52-year-old Nancy Lanza, had five weapons registered to her, including a Glock, a Sig Sauer, and a Bushmaster rifle. Police said the Glock, the Sig Sauer and the Bushmaster at the school appeared to be registered to a family member. Authorities are currently completing their checks to see which weapons were used in the slayings, to whom they were registered and how they were obtained. Lanza, who was described by neighbors and former classmates as being very bright, took six classes at Western Connecticut State University in 2008 and 2009, beginning when he was just 16, and had a grade point average of 3.26. According to Paul Steinmetz, Director of University of Relations at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Lanza started at the school in the summer of 2008, took a couple classes that fall and then in the spring and summer of 2009. A 16-year-old attending classes is rare, not unique, Steinmetz said. He said that some high school students sign up for classes at the college if they are particularly good in some subject. He said the school has probably a few 16-year-olds every semester. Lanza took courses in computer science, such as website design, the computer language called BASIC, and data modeling, as well as in philosophy, American history and economics. Steinmetz said he had not heard from anybody on the staff who has any knowledge of Lanza at all, but it would be unusual for a professor to remember a student in a class from four years ago. He said that in the classes Lanza took there would likely be 20 to 25 students. Long before Lanza's spree residents of Newtown had noticed that tall, pale boy was different, and believed he had some kind of unspecified personality disorder. \\"Adam Lanza has been a weird kid since we were five years old,\\" wrote a neighbor and former classmate Timothy Dalton on Twitter. \\"As horrible as this was, I can't say I am surprised.\\" In school, Lanza carried a black briefcase and spoke little. Every day, he wore a sort of uniform: khakis and a shirt buttoned up to the neck, with pens lined up in his shirt pocket. A former classmate in his 10th grade honors English class, Olivia DeVivo, says he \\"was always very nervous and socially awkward.\\" She told ABC News that \\"he didn't really want to be spoken to\\" and that when teachers would call on him \\"it appeared physically difficult for him to speak.\\" Lanza avoided public attention and had few, if any, friends, though he was a member of the high-school tech club. He liked to sit near the door of the classroom to make a quick exit. ||||| A:","completion":"Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old who killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school, reportedly suffered from a condition that made him unable to feel pain. Former acquaintances described him as bright but troubled, and socially awkward, often avoiding eye contact and lacking connections with other kids. Lanza's mother, Nancy, was increasingly concerned about his emotional and behavioral issues, particularly after her divorce from his father. On the day of the shooting, Lanza shot his mother in the face before driving to Sandy Hook Elementary School and killing 26 people including children aged between five and ten."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Bats fly through an area - The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - The sound waves travel away from the bat - The sound waves hit objects - The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from - The bat doesn't hurt itself by hitting the objects. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bat makes sound waves towards objects happens, how will it affect \\"the bat wont hit any objects\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests the introduction of an alteration or disturbance to the existing process, in this case, the bat's echolocation process. If we assume that a bat makes sound waves towards objects as a part of the perturbation hypothesis, it can affect the echolocation process, potentially making it difficult for the bat to avoid hitting objects. The possible results of the perturbation are: 1. Reduced accuracy in echolocation: If the sound waves produced by the bat are altered or disturbed, the quality of the echo received back may be compromised. This could make it challenging for the bat to accurately determine the location, distance, and size of the objects, increasing the chances of colliding with them. 2. Delayed or disrupted signals: If the sound waves are disturbed in any way, there might be a delay in the echo received by the bat or no echo at all. This delay or lack of information could result in the bat not having enough time to adjust its flight path and might cause it to hit the objects. 3. Confusing signals from multiple sources: The perturbation could alter the echoes' consistency by introducing other sounds or reflections from various objects. In such cases, the bat might have difficulties differentiating between different echoes, which could lead to a miscalculation and an increased likelihood of hitting objects. 4. Adaptation and learning: Bats learn and adapt their echolocation techniques based on different environments and conditions. If the perturbation is consistent or repetitive, the bats might develop strategies to overcome the challenges and continue to avoid hitting objects. In conclusion, the introduction of the perturbation hypothesis, where the bat makes sound waves towards objects, could directly or indirectly affect the bat's ability to avoid hitting objects. Depending on the nature and extent of the disturbance, the effect could range from minor disruptions in echolocation accuracy to the bats being more prone to collisions. However, there is also the potential for adaptation and learning, which could mitigate the effects of these perturbations over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: How did Ottoman culture change over time? A:","completion":"Ottoman culture changed over time as a result of their efforts to build a large collection of libraries, complete with translations of books from other cultures and original manuscripts. The Ottomans fostered a desire for local and foreign manuscripts, which became particularly prominent in the 15th century. They invited scholars from various backgrounds and disciplines to contribute to their educational institutions, and as a result, the knowledge from these different cultures and fields of study influenced Ottoman society. An example of this influence can be seen in the actions of Sultan Mehmet II, who ordered Greek scholar Georgios Amiroutzes to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy. This highlights the Ottomans' dedication to embracing knowledge and learning from other cultures to advance their own intellectual and cultural growth. Another example is the impact of Ali Qushji, an astronomer, mathematician, and physicist originally from Samarkand. He became a professor in two madrasas, and although he spent only two or three years before his death in Istanbul, his writings and the activities of his students significantly influenced Ottoman circles. These examples demonstrate how Ottoman culture evolved over time as a result of the empire's deliberate efforts to incorporate and assimilate knowledge from other cultures and individuals. This active engagement with diverse ideas and intellectual traditions enriched Ottoman society and played a key role in the advancement of their educational institutions and overall cultural development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: new york city says fewer officers firing guns Text:","completion":"Title: New York City Reports Decrease in Police Officers Firing Guns In an encouraging turn of events, New York City has recently reported a decrease in the number of police officers involved in firearm incidents. This highlights a significant step forward in the city's commitment to community safety and police reform. The steady decline in incidents involving the use of guns by law enforcement in the city is attributed to various factors, including improved police training, greater emphasis on de-escalation strategies, and the strengthening of community relations. The New York Police Department (NYPD) has always been under scrutiny regarding its use of force policies, specifically in relation to gun use. Over the years, numerous reports have documented incidents involving disproportionate use of force by NYPD officers. The decline in firearm incidents signals a positive shift towards the goal of implementing a more equitable policing system, which is essential to ensuring public confidence and fostering trust between citizens and the police. One of the primary ways the NYPD has managed to achieve this has been through the implementation of comprehensive training programs that focus on enhancing officers' skills in handling potentially violent situations. These training sessions are designed to teach officers how to respond efficiently and effectively while minimizing the use of force, particularly when it comes to discharging weapons. This has contributed to the reduction in the number of officers involved in firearm incidents, as they are now better equipped to de-escalate situations without resorting to lethal force. Another contributing factor is the increased emphasis on community engagement and collaboration with local organizations, which has been key in fostering stronger relationships between the NYPD and the community it serves. By actively working to bridge the gap between citizens and the police, the department has managed to create a safer environment for everyone. Through community engagement initiatives, the NYPD has gained unique insights into the issues faced by different neighborhoods and has been able to devise more effective strategies to address those concerns, without necessarily relying on the use of guns. Furthermore, the use of body cameras by NYPD officers has contributed significantly to the decline in firearm incidents. Besides providing objective evidence of police interactions, the devices also serve as a deterrent to potential misuse of force, as officers are increasingly held accountable for their actions when captured on video. With the knowledge that their actions are recorded, officers are more likely to resort to alternative methods of conflict resolution before resorting to the use of firearms. Lastly, the introduction of the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) program has resulted in more effective responses to individuals experiencing mental health crises. The CIT program trains officers in de-escalating situations when dealing with those suffering from mental health problems or emotional distress, thereby reducing the likelihood of officers resorting to the use of firearms. In conclusion, the decrease in the number of officers involved in firearm incidents in New York City represents a significant step in the right direction. The NYPD's efforts in implementing comprehensive training programs, promoting community engagement, utilizing body cameras, and adopting the CIT program have all contributed to the decline in firearm incidents. It is important to continue these efforts in order to further the momentum towards a more equitable and trust-based relationship between the police department and the communities they serve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: \\"Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta\\" (\\"Do you not long for our little cottage\\"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more beautiful than her own: \\"Qual'occhio al mondo\\" (\\"What eyes in the world\\").

Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are decreases or increases ): More particles inside the container means more collisions, and more collisions mean a higher pressure. What happens to the pressure inside of Jim's beaker if he decreases the amount of collisions between particles inside of it decreases or increases?","completion":"Based on the passage, the correlation between the number of particles (and by extension, the number of collisions) and the pressure inside the container is positive. This means that as the number of particles or collisions increases, the pressure inside the container also increases. Conversely, if the number of particles or collisions decreases, the pressure inside the container would also decrease. Hence, if Jim decreases the amount of collisions between particles inside his beaker, the pressure inside of it would decrease. The reasoning behind this is grounded in the kinetic molecular theory of gases, according to which, gases are made up of a large number of small particles that are in constant, random motion. These particles frequently collide with each other and with the walls of their container. Each collision exerts a force on the wall, and the collective force of all these collisions is what we perceive as pressure. Therefore, the more collisions there are, the greater the force on the wall, which in turn causes the pressure to increase. Conversely, if there are fewer collisions, the collective force on the wall is reduced, leading to a decrease in pressure. So, in Jim's case, reducing the number of collisions would lead to a reduction in pressure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which location the Geiger counter would click, location A or location C? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's examine the information given in the paragraph step-by-step: 1. Keith is learning how the Geiger counter works. 2. He tests the Geiger counter in 3 different locations (A, B, and C) with varying degrees of radiation. 3. Location A has very high radiation. 4. Location B has low radiation. 5. Location C doesn't have any radiation. Now, let's analyze the information. A Geiger counter is a device used to detect and measure ionizing radiation, such as alpha, beta, and gamma particles. The counter clicks to indicate the presence of radiation. Given that Location A has very high radiation, it means that the Geiger counter will detect the radiation and click as it registers the particles. On the other hand, Location C doesn't have any radiation, so the Geiger counter should not click in this location. Therefore, the answer is Location A, as the Geiger counter would click in this location due to the high radiation present."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer based on context: Back from Arakan, Tabinshwehti looked east to Siam, which had occupied what he considered his territory. His response to \\"Siamese incursions\\" would launch the centuries-long Burmese-Siamese Wars between Burma and Siam. Siamese sources deny that Siam began the hostilities; rather, it was Burma's attempt to expand its territory eastwards taking advantage of a political crisis in Ayutthaya that started the hostilities. The Burmese king sent a sizeable force led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein of Martaban to drive out the Siamese forces from Ye and Tavoy in late 1547. Saw Lagun Ein's forces defeated Siamese forces led by the governor of Kanchanaburi, and retook down to Tavoy. Tabinshwehti was not satisfied, and planned an invasion of Siam itself. Next year, near the end of the rainy season on 14 October 1548, , 12,000 strong Toungoo forces led by Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung invaded Siam via the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces overcame Siamese defences, and advanced to the capital city of Ayutthaya. But they could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, in January 1549, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. On retreat, the Burmese tried to take Kamphaeng Phet, but it too was well defended by Portuguese mercenaries. Fortunately for the Burmese, they caught two important Siamese nobles in some open fighting, and negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the nobles in February 1549.

Title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind.

Article:There were about 30 of them, according to the caretaker in the apartment block where he lived. Abul Kalam Azad says they were in plain clothes but had an air of confident authority. Some carried pistols. Gen Azmi hid in an empty flat on the fifth floor. He is the son of Ghulam Azam, a former leader of one of Bangladesh's main opposition parties, Jamaat-e-Islami, and would have known that the sons of two other senior Bangladeshi politicians had been kidnapped earlier in the month. The United Nations and human rights groups including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have been warning for years that forced disappearances and extra-judicial killings are common in Bangladesh. But this year, there has been an alarming rise in the number of cases. The men who came for Gen Azmi did not produce any identification documents. They demanded to know where the control room for the CCTV cameras was, and took the discs from the system. When Mr Azad, the caretaker, told them he did not know where the former brigadier general was, they dragged him into a side room off the garage and beat him. He kept silent, so they began searching flat by flat, working their way slowly up through the building. The Bangladeshi human rights organisations Odhikar and Ain-o-Salish Kendra keep a running tally of the number of people who have been taken. They believe some 60 people have gone missing in similar circumstances this year alone, and about 300 over the seven years since the government has been in power. Bangladesh-based journalist David Bergman has been tracking what happens to the disappeared. According to his figures, about half of those taken this year eventually reappeared. The lucky ones - a small minority - were simply released, with threats of dire consequences if they ever talked about what had happened to them. Another 30 or so turned up in police custody or in court charged with some offence. This is what happened to two men who were at a Dhaka cafe when it was attacked by Islamist militants on 1 July. They went missing after the commando raid that ended the siege, only to be formally arrested a month later. The fate of the other secret detainees is even more sinister. Fifteen are dead, most killed in alleged shootouts with law enforcement agencies. Nineteen people remain missing. The human rights groups allege the Bangladeshi government is using the security forces to target rival politicians and activists, a claim it denies. \\"We can safely say there haven't been incidents of disappearances or kidnap with law enforcement agencies in the last two or three years,\\" Bangladesh's Law Minister Anisul Huq tells me. \\"Whenever there is even one complaint that is found to be true, then we investigate.\\" Mr Huq says the disappearance claims are part of a plot by opposition parties to discredit the government. \\"There are many frivolous complaints, and they are trying to get mileage from that by complaining to the human rights activists or to journalists so that it can be fanned up,\\" he says. \\"If they have a list I would like to look into it, and I am saying I will look into it.\\" But the UN Working Group on Enforced Disappearances says it has repeatedly asked Bangladesh to investigate the role of law enforcement agencies in disappearances and killings over the past five years. And, like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, it says it has requested information on named individuals. Yet despite reminders, the UN says, it has received no response from the government. The men did eventually find Gen Azmi. They smashed down the door of the flat in which he was hiding and dragged him out into the hallway. Mr Azad saw what happened next. \\"They tied a blindfold around his eyes,\\" he says, \\"and took him downstairs and pushed him into a mini-van. \\"Then, they drove away.\\" \\"We haven't heard anything since,\\" the former brigadier general's 83-year-old mother, Syeda Afifa Azam, tells me. \\"We don't who took him or what has happened to him,\\" she says, breaking down in tears. Meenakshi Ganguly, of Human Rights Watch, says the impact of forced disappearances on families is terrible. \\"In all the human rights work I do, this is the worst abuse because people just never know what has happened, they just keep waiting for people to come back home,\\" he says. \\"At least with extra-judicial killings, there is some sort of closure. \\"With disappearances, families just keep waiting.\\" Gen Azmi's family say they asked the police to investigate, but the police told the BBC they had no knowledge of the case. \\"How can a mother suffer this?\\" asks Mrs Azam.

Maria, on the other hand, enjoyed basking in the warmth and never seemed to mind the heat. They were best friends and roommates who had adopted a Golden Retriever together. They named him Max, and he added excitement and laughter to their lives. Still, the responsibilities of taking care of Max had to be divided according to their preferences and comfort levels. Whenever the weather forecast showed a particularly scorching day ahead, Maria would be the one to take up the role of walking Max. She didn't need persuading because she genuinely loved the sun, the way it radiated energy to everything around it. She appreciated how the warmth complemented her caramel complexion, giving her skin a radiant glow. Plus, the heat made her feel alive and allowed her to spend more time outdoors, helping her maintain her already healthy living style. While Maria was busy enjoying the warmth of the sun, Sarah would make herself comfortable indoors. She enjoyed the air conditioning and would immerse herself in her hobbies like reading, painting, or watching her favorite TV shows. The blistering heat was never her friend, as it would make her sweat profusely and gave her heat rashes. Sarah's fair skin was also at risk for sunburn, making it even more crucial for her to avoid extended sun exposure. Maria would take Max for long strolls through the neighborhood, allowing him to sniff and explore his surroundings. She would bring along sandals to change into when the scorching pavement heated her shoes, whereas Max's thick paw pads were better suited for handling the hot surfaces. Occasionally, they would take a break at a nearby park to hydrate and interact with other pet owners and their furry companions, making the most of the warm day. Max enjoyed the summer heat as much as Maria did. His thick, golden fur would gleam in the sunlight, giving him an almost majestic appearance. Though Sarah couldn't partake in the summertime dog-walking, she made up for it by being the one to handle Max's baths, grooming sessions, and indoor playtime.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Now, I have a new situation: Croatia and Italy were two countries of similar size and population located on opposite shores of the same sea. Croatia based its economy on tourism and fishing, while Italy based its economy on conventional agriculture. Both countries had thriving economies, but they both polluted the sea in different ways. Answer this question please: Which country caused the formation of fewer dead zones? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background information and the economic focus of each country, it is likely that Croatia caused the formation of fewer dead zones. Croatia primarily relies on tourism and fishing, which are industries that could have a comparatively lower impact on the release of oxygen-depleting chemicals into the ocean. Tourism, in particular, may not have a direct impact on marine pollution, and the fishing industry might have stricter environmental regulations in order to maintain a healthy ecosystem for aquatic life. On the other hand, Italy focuses on conventional agriculture, which has a higher potential for contributing to marine pollution through the runoff of fertilizers, livestock waste, and human waste. This runoff may lead to a higher concentration of oxygen-depleting chemicals entering the ocean and consequently causing the formation of dead zones. In summary, based on the economic activities of each country, Croatia likely caused fewer dead zones compared to Italy. However, it is important to note that the actual impact of each country on marine pollution would depend on various factors such as pollution control measures, environmental regulations, and the specific practices within each industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I bought a jasmine plant for my office. When I bought it, I was told it would bloom and the sweet smell would fill my office. I had the plant for two months, and every day I looked at it, but there weren't any flowers or pleasant smell. I was not happy, so I gave the plant to my friend Linda. One day, another friend Mary called and invited me to her office. When I walked in, her jasmine flowers surprised me. I reached out to touch the flowers. Mary cut some and gave them to me. I couldn't help smelling them. Surrounded by the sweet smell of only a handful of these flowers, I suddenly understood something. Mary bought her plant the same time I did. It took a year for her jasmine to bloom. I was so impatient for mine to bloom; regretfully, I gave it away. In a way my life is like the jasmine plant. I need to be patient and let things happen. Last Sunday Linda told me that she was going abroad the next week. Before she left, she returned the plant to me. This time I am going to wait.

Join her on Facebook and follow her on Twitter @drpeggydrexler. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- After a day spent being trailed by a photographer who taunted him, mocked his clothes and hurled insults about his family, actor Jonah Hill had had enough. \\"Suck my d***, you f****t,\\" he said to the guy, very likely giving the paparazzo exactly what he wanted: a reaction and a profanity-and-slur laced one at that. The entire episode was caught on tape and eventually aired by gossip site TMZ. Hill soon after made the rounds with an apology for using the anti-gay term, telling radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday that he is heartbroken he used such a \\"disgusting and hurtful\\" term. On \\"The Tonight Show,\\" he told host Jimmy Fallon that \\"the word I chose was grotesque.\\" But while Hill is left apologizing -- and surely, there is reason for him to do so -- the responsibility was not his alone. After all, the entire episode was a set up, encouraged by a culture obsessed with celebrities and even more obsessed with celebrities behaving badly and a gossip media that rewards those who capture it. The paparazzi have been trained to push buttons, and they've gotten quite good at it. Unlike some stars who, it might be suspected, exhibit bad behavior to court certain attention -- Alec Baldwin could be one -- Hill's response seemed genuinely reactionary, born out of pure emotion and frustration. As such, it is not likely to reflect what he really believes. Hill has been outspoken supporter of gay rights. Last year, he told E! News that \\"I have tons of gay friends, gay family members.\\" Before the Winter Olympics in Russia, he spoke out against Moscow's anti-gay laws. So why, then, was his breaking point reaction a slur? It probably had far less to do with genuine homophobic beliefs than with power and a feeling of loss of it so profound that it inspired a response rooted in the same crude immaturity as that exhibited by his provoker. The photographer, as seen in the video, was antagonistic, his behavior akin to the taunts of a playground bully, and in a way few adults exhibit, or experience, after childhood. And so, in finally responding after refusing to engage, Hill used language the man would understand and words that he, and indeed many, might never say as an adult, especially an adult in 2014. He had a temper tantrum-like reaction, calling on words he might have used at a time he was most inclined to have such outbursts and tantrums, when such words were not OK but you were less aware of what they meant. It's key to remember that celebrities are forced to endure harassment all the time now and bear the burden of the consequences, too. In 2009, Jude Law allegedly hit a female celebrity photographer after her camera flash went off in his face, although he claims it was untrue. Hugh Grant once threw a tub of baked beans at a cameraman. Nicole Richie had restraining orders issued against two photographers who sat outside her house all day, but not until after she doused them with water for trailing her. While celebrities certainly are not perfect, the ones caught on camera, and the ones largely condemned, are inevitably not the ones holding it. To make Hill's comments reflective of how he feels about gays and lesbians unfairly turns the responsibility entirely on him when the real blame is in the culture that rewards those who provoke this behavior and choose to interpret it in the worst way possible. By suggesting these comments indicate that Hill is homophobic, aren't we, in effect, saying that we believe that's what he meant because what else would he mean? In the end, Hill has behaved after his outburst in the most appropriate way possible, expressing believable remorse, explaining the motivations for the attack but also noting there was no excuse for what he said. \\"If someone says something that hurt you or angers you, use me as an example of what not to do,\\" he told Fallon. \\"Don't respond with hatred or anger, because you are just adding more ugliness to the world.\\" Perhaps the celebrity media would be wise to do the same.

Movie title: Enduring Love Movie plot: One fine spring afternoon, Joe (Daniel Craig) and his girlfriend Claire (Samantha Morton) get away for a romantic picnic in the countryside near Oxford. Joe pauses before he surprises Claire by producing a bottle of Dom Perignon. The moment appears portentous, but before Joe can pop the cork and say whatever is on his mind, a huge red hot-air balloon drifts onto the field.A young boy cowers in the basket of the balloon which is being dragged along the ground quickly while an older man, his grandfather, trails behind, pulling on one of the ropes and urging the frightened boy to jump out. Joe races to assist, and he is joined by several other men coming from all directions. It looks like they've got the situation under control, but before the boy can climb out of the basket, the wind picks up, setting the balloon suddenly aloft; the men hang on reflexively. As the balloon rises higher and higher, four men let go one by one, tumbling safely to the ground. They recover from their panic only to realise that one man never let go and is now dangling from the end of a rope hundreds of feet in the air, the balloon still rising and floating away from the field. The group watch in helpless horror as the man finally loses his grip and falls to his death in the distance.While the onlookers all gape in shock, Joe, rational and practical to a fault, decides to walk over to where the man fell and see if anything can be done. One of the men from the group (Rhys Ifans) follows behind him. A grisly sight awaits Joe and the other man, and it is immediately obvious that the man who fell is quite beyond assistance. The man who tagged along suggests that Joe pray with him. Joe resists, grumbling that prayers won't help, but the other man pleads with him until he finally kneels down. Eventually the authorities arrive and everyone leaves the tragic scene.Shortly afterwards, Joe and Claire are dining at the home of their married friends Robin (Bill Nighy) and Rachel (Susan Lynch), retelling the story of what happened on that fateful...

Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B. Would zone B see less or more organisms than zone A? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, zone B, which is near a national park and not declared as a dead zone, would likely see more organisms than zone A, which has been declared as a dead zone. Step 1: Understand the environmental factors in zone A and zone B Zone A: Agricultural lands nearby, declared as a dead zone Zone B: Near a national park, not declared as a dead zone Step 2: Consider the impact of dissolved fertilizer carried by runoff Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away from agricultural lands and towards bodies of water, including lakes. Nitrogen in the fertilizer can lead to an increase in algae growth. Step 3: Assess the consequences of increased algae growth When algae grow out of control, they use up carbon dioxide in the water, and when they die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. This process consumes the oxygen in the water, creating a dead zone where nothing grows due to the lack of oxygen. Step 4: Compare the conditions of zone A and zone B Since zone A is a dead zone with low oxygen levels due to the presence of agricultural lands nearby, it is likely to have fewer organisms. In contrast, zone B is not declared as a dead zone and is situated near a national park, which may not have the same level of fertilizer pollution, and therefore would likely have better water quality and more organisms.

As dog owners, it's essential to understand how physiotherapy techniques can help alleviate the pain caused by arthritis in our pets. In this article, we will explore what physiotherapy entails and how to incorporate massage, passive mobilization, heat application, and transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) to help ease the pain caused by arthritis in your dog. Understanding Physiotherapy for Dogs Physiotherapy is a branch of health care that focuses on the preservation, restoration, and improvement of movement and function through physical methods like massage, heat treatment, and exercises. For dogs suffering from arthritis, physiotherapy aims to alleviate pain, improve joint mobility, and restore muscle strength. Massage Techniques to Relieve Arthritic Pain A gentle massage can help relax your dog's muscles, improve circulation, and release endorphins, which are natural pain relievers. Here are some specific massage techniques to try: 1. Effleurage: This is a gentle stroking technique using the palm of your hand. Begin at the head and move towards the tail, focusing on the large muscle groups. Effleurage helps warm up the tissues and promotes relaxation. 2. Petrissage: This involves a deeper kneading and rolling motion to stimulate the muscles and increase blood flow. Concentrate on areas where your dog appears to be stiff or sore. 3. Passive Range of Motion (PROM): Gently move each of your dog's limbs, one at a time, through a full range of motion. Hold each stretch for a few seconds, and then release. Trying Passive Mobilization Passive mobilization is another physiotherapy technique that involves moving your dog's joints gently and slowly without using their muscle power. The goal is to help maintain or improve joint mobility and flexibility. To practice passive mobilization, hold your dog's affected limb and move the joint through its entire range of motion, carefully and gently. Applying Heat to Arthritic Limbs Heat application can provide pain relief for dogs with arthritis by promoting blood flow and relaxation of the muscles around the joints. You can use a warm, damp towel or a pet-safe heating pad to apply heat to your dog's arthritic limbs. Be cautious with the temperature, ensuring it is warm but not uncomfortably hot. Apply heat for 10-15 minutes at a time, and monitor your dog's reaction closely. Discussing Transcutaneous Nerve Stimulation (TNS) with Your Vet TNS is a non-invasive therapy that uses a low-voltage electrical current to stimulate the nerves and interrupt pain signals, providing relief for your dog. Talk to your veterinarian about whether your dog is a suitable candidate for TNS therapy. If so, your vet will provide you with guidance on how to use the TNS device, as well as the appropriate frequency and duration of the treatment sessions. Conclusion As a responsible dog owner, it is essential to understand and implement physiotherapy techniques to help your arthritic dog. Incorporating massage, passive mobilization, heat application, and discussing TNS with your veterinarian can improve your dog's quality of life, alleviate pain, and strengthen their bond with you. Always consult with your veterinarian before trying any new therapies or treatments to ensure the well-being of your beloved pet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? . Turn off your television and your cell phone, and eliminate other external distractions. Use a space in which you feel comfortable and free from the need to complete tasks and other stressors. Set aside designated time to meditate, preferably between twenty minutes and a couple hours, depending on your abilities and preferences. Wear comfortable clothes that are suitable for your space’s temperature. You’ll want to avoid being distracted by stiff clothing or by being too hot or too cold. Don’t allow birds chirping, cars driving by, and other unavoidable external sounds to interrupt your meditation. Being aware of the world and its interconnections can actually be beneficial to meditation. However, if you live in a location, such as by a subway stop or train track, where noise is dominating your thoughts, you should consider putting on music or a mantra recording, both of which are available on Youtube and other services. To eliminate stiffness and tension in your body as you sit still to meditate, you should stretch yourself out before beginning. Take a few minutes before meditating to stretch your legs, hips, back, shoulders, and neck. While sitting, hold your legs out straight in front of you and reach for your toes to stretch your calves and hamstrings. Bend your knees while seated and bring the soles of your feet together to stretch your hips and quadriceps. Typically, one sits in a seated, cross-legged position when they meditate. Do so only if it’s comfortable for you to sit cross-legged for an extended period of time, and hold your back upright, unbowed but not unnaturally straight. However, consider sitting in a chair or with your back braced by a wall or other object if you are unable to sit cross-legged without discomfort. Remember it's important to wear comfortable clothes that allow you to sit still for a while. You will want to avoid distractions from tension or stiffness in your body. Especially if you are just beginning to practice meditation, it is most important to find a distraction-free, comfortable body position. Sit on a yoga mat, a cushion, or on folded blankets or towels for more comfort. Begin your meditation with controlled breathing techniques. Be conscious of your breathing and use each breath you take to focus your intention. Breathe in slowly as you count to four, hold for four, and exhale for four. Let your awareness on your breath help you clear your mind and focus your concentration. As you inhale, consider light flowing through your essence, as life rises through your vertebrae and fills you. Imagine the energy-filled center at the point where your in-breath fuses with your out-breath. As you exhale and your breath is out completely, visualize a universal pause in which your particular self vanishes and focus on your interconnectedness with everything around you.

What do Tom Sawyer and Jumping Frogs have in common? Stories about both of them were created by one man: Mark Twain. Twain was four years old when his family moved to Hannibal, Missouri, located on the west bank of the Mississippi. Twain grew up there and was fascinated with (......) life along the river----the steamboats, the giant lumber rafts, and the people who worked on them. The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County is one of Twain's best loved short stories, and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is one of his most famous novels. Both these works are celebrated by events held during National Tom Sawyer Days, which originated in the late 1950s and became national in the 1960s. Children enter their frogs in the jumping contest during National Tom Sawyer Days. There's also a fence painting contest to see who can paint the fastest. The idea for this contest comes from a scene in Tom Sawyer, in which Tom has been told to paint the fence in front of the house he lives in. It's a beautiful day, and he would rather be doing anything else. As his friends walk by, he makes them believe that it's fun to paint, and they join in the \\"fun\\". By the end of the day, the fence has three coats of paint! Although the story of Tom Sawyer is a fiction, it's based on facts.

That slowed down, however, after Russia's finance ministry took emergency measures to try to stem the currency's precipitous plunge. Meanwhile, Russian consumers frantically flocked to stores to buy up big-ticket items, as they looked to forestall massive price hikes following the ruble’s fall in past days. But many also dropped thousands of dollars worth of rubles on everything from booze to breakfast cereal, prompting social media users to joke that they were \\"investing\\" their money in the items. “Good that my husband invested in vodka. We’ll get drunk out of sorrow when our 20 bucks is gone,” tweeted one user. Хорошо, что муж в водку вложился.

Several car dealerships suspended sales, as they were unsure how far the ruble would fall, The Wall Street Journal reported. But with consumers' confidence in banks low, dealerships that remained open saw a wave of customers looking to buy automobiles, especially luxury vehicles. Customers order at a food stall near a currency exchange in Moscow on Tuesday, Dec. 16. Ikea, the Swedish furniture giant, notified consumers that its prices would rise on Thursday. The news brought in larger-than-normal crowds for a Wednesday. Ikea isn’t alone in hiking its prices. Apple did the same on Wednesday, after it shut down online sales in Russia on Tuesday to readjust them. As of Wednesday afternoon, the prices of iPhone 6 devices ranged from 785 dollars to nearly 1,000.

The ruble has collapsed to historic lows this week, alongside falling oil prices. A series of sanctions against Russia by the West has also had a devastating impact on the country’s economy. Faced with the possibly of a full-blown run on the banks, Russia's finance ministry sold some of its 7 billion of foreign reserves to bolster the ruble after it suffered its worst devaluation in 16 years. The struggling currency lost 17% to the U.S. dollar on Monday and Tuesday alone, adding up to a 52% loss against the dollar this year.

It has become detached from fundamentals, and does not reflect the state of the economy,” he was quoted as saying. “There is no point in introducing extremely strict regulation of this area, such as there has been in previous periods. That does not help anyone.” “Our future actions should be based on market mechanisms.\\" Financial analysts, on the other hand, didn’t hold back. Timothy Ash, an analyst at Standard Bank, called the ministry of finance’s move “unbelievable stuff.” “Why, if the central bank has 413 billion in reserves, is the ministry of finance being called on to put its hand in its pocket for some small change — they are, like, checking the back of the sofas at this stage,” Ash told The Financial Times. \\"I don’t think I have ever seen any currency go through such extreme gyrations in all my time in the industry.\\" \\"The ruble is fast becoming untradable — maybe that is what the central bank wants,” he added. The Central Bank of Russia gave no indication on Wednesday that it would intervene. Even if the bank did, it is unclear how much that would have helped. Its sale of foreign cash to the tune of 1.96 billion on Monday did not manage to slow the ruble’s fall. The ruble's rout poses a threat to Russian President Vladimir Putin's grip on power. He has offered relative prosperity and economic stability to the country's middle class during his 15 years in office in exchange for passive political participation. Should the ruble's slide cause Russia to default, like it did in 1998, it could lead to civil unrest, critics say. Additional reporting by The Associated Press Have something to add to this story?

Given the question: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Question: What is beginning work likely to lead to a day of? Options: A. sleeping B. momentum C. stress D. excitement E. working The answer is:","completion":"B. momentum Starting work is most likely to lead to a day of momentum. When a person begins working on a task or activity, they often find it easier to continue that work throughout the day. By engaging in work, they often build a sense of forward motion and progress, which makes it more likely that they will keep working. Momentum is a term used to describe the ongoing energy and motivation generated by engaging in a particular task or series of tasks. It is a crucial element in productivity, as it helps individuals stay focused and maintain a forward direction in their work. The more momentum a person generates, the more likely they are to finish the task they started and perhaps even move on to other tasks. By starting work at the beginning of the day, an individual is setting themselves up for a productive day. This early momentum can be maintained throughout the day, leading to a higher likelihood of completing the tasks at hand. Additionally, this momentum can spill over to other areas of life, making it easier to stay focused and engaged in personal and professional activities. Option A. sleeping is not in line with common sense because starting work at the beginning of the day will likely lead to more work being done, rather than a day spent sleeping. Option C. stress may be a possibility for some, but it is not the most reasonable response to starting work. It is important to note that there are strategies to manage stress effectively even when beginning a workday. Option D. excitement may be experienced by some individuals when starting a new project or task, but the most common response to beginning work would be momentum, as it fuels their energy and focus. Option E. working, while accurate to some extent, is not the most descriptive answer to the question, as working does not necessarily imply an ongoing momentum and motivation to continue the work throughout the day. In conclusion, the option most in line with common sense to answer the question about what is beginning work likely to lead to a day of is option B. momentum.

If I tell you that All insects have wings that are part of the exoskeleton, and ask you the question \\"what have wings that are part of the exoskeleton?\\", is the correct answer \\"animals\\"? The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"animals.\\" The accurate answer to the question \\"What have wings that are part of the exoskeleton?\\" would be \\"insects.\\" Let's break this down further to provide more clarity and detail. Insects belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which includes a vast group of animals with exoskeletons, jointed limbs, and segmented bodies. Insects form the largest class within this phylum, called Insecta or Hexapoda, which have three pairs of legs and typically an external pair of wings. The wings are, as you pointed out, part of the insects' exoskeleton. An exoskeleton is a hard, protective outer covering that provides structural support for an organism. In insects, a tough substance called chitin forms the exoskeleton. This coating has evolved to perform various functions, including providing physical barriers against predators, conserving water, and serving as a base for the attachment of muscles to enable movement. Insects such as butterflies, moths, beetles, and dragonflies have wings that are part of their exoskeleton. These wings are flexible extensions of the exoskeleton, varying in size, shape, and function among different species. They play a crucial role in the insects' ability to fly, escape predators, court mates, and disperse to new habitats. It's essential to note that it is not accurate to categorize all animals within this context, as not all animals have an exoskeleton or wings. The animal kingdom is vast and diverse, encompassing various species and taxonomic groupings, many of which do not possess the specific characteristics described in your original statement. For example, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish do not have an exoskeleton or wings derived from it. In conclusion, the precise answer to your question is \\"insects,\\" as they have wings that are part of their exoskeleton.

Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility. A:","completion":"Patient B, who has Turner syndrome, would likely be shorter than Patient D, who does not have any of these illnesses. One of the characteristic features of Turner syndrome is short stature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is known for making the annual decision on who will be the laureate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded in memory of the donor Alfred Nobel. - Roderick MacKinnon ( born 19 February 1956 ) is a professor of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics at Rockefeller University who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Peter Agre in 2003 for his work on the structure and operation of ion channels . - The Nobel Committee for Chemistry is the Nobel Committee responsible for proposing laureates for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The Nobel Committee for Chemistry is appointed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It usually consists of Swedish professors of chemistry who are members of the Academy, although the Academy in principle could appoint anyone to the Committee. - Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans. - The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM), located in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., is the academic medical teaching and research arm of Johns Hopkins University. Johns Hopkins has consistently been among the nation's top medical schools in the number of research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health. Its major teaching hospital, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, was ranked the #1 hospital in the United States for 22 years by \\"U.S. News & World Report\\". - Nanotechnology (\\"nanotech\\") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \\"nanotechnologies\\" as well as \\"nanoscale technologies\\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars. - Aquaporins also called water channels, are integral membrane proteins from a larger family of major intrinsic proteins that form pores in the membrane of biological cells. - Peter Agre (born January 30, 1949) is an American physician and molecular biologist, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute. In 2003, Agre and Roderick MacKinnon shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discoveries concerning channels in cell membranes. Agre was recognized for his discovery of aquaporin water channels. Aquaporins are water-channel proteins that move water molecules through the cell membrane. In 2009, Agre was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and became active in science diplomacy. - Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles, practices and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics and chemical equilibrium. - Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, Jr. (30 August 1852 1 March 1911) was a Dutch physical chemist. A highly influential theoretical chemist of his time, van 't Hoff was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His pioneering work helped found the modern theory of chemical affinity, chemical equilibrium, chemical kinetics, and chemical thermodynamics. In his 1874 pamphlet Van't Hoff formulated the theory of the tetrahedral carbon atom and laid the foundations of stereochemistry. In 1875 he predicted the correct structures of allenes and cumulenes as well as their axial chirality. He is also widely considered one of the founders of physical chemistry as the discipline is known today. - The Lasker Awards have been awarded annually since 1945 to living persons who have made major contributions to medical science or who have performed public service on behalf of medicine. They are administered by the Lasker Foundation, founded by Albert Lasker and his wife Mary Woodard Lasker (later a medical research activist). The awards are sometimes referred to as \\"America's Nobels\\". Lasker Award has gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize. Eighty-six Lasker laureates have received the Nobel Prize, including 32 in the last two decades. Claire Pomeroy is the current President of the Foundation. - The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) is part of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. As the first independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States, the Bloomberg School is a leading international authority on the improvement of health and prevention of disease and disability. The school's mission is to protect populations from illness and injury by pioneering new research, deploying its knowledge and expertise in the field, and educating scientists and practitioners in the global defense of human life. The school is ranked first in public health in the \\"U.S. News and World Report\\" rankings and has held that ranking since 1994. - Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of water across a semipermeable membrane. It is also defined as the measure of the tendency of a solution to take in water by osmosis. Potential osmotic pressure is the maximum osmotic pressure that could develop in a solution if it were separated from distilled water by a selectively permeable membrane. The phenomenon of osmosis arises from the propensity of a pure solvent to move through a semi-permeable membrane and into a solution containing a solute to which the membrane is impermeable. This process is of vital importance in biology as the cell's membrane is semipermeable. - The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or \\"Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien\\" is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. It is an independent, non-governmental scientific organisation which takes special responsibility for the natural sciences and mathematics, but endeavours to promote the exchange of ideas between various disciplines. - The National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formerly the Institute of Medicine) is an American nonprofit, non-governmental organization. The National Academy of Medicine is a part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Research Council (NRC). - Biophysics or biological physics is an interdisciplinary science that applies the approaches and methods of physics to study biological systems. Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, physical chemistry, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics and systems biology. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea.

A childhood accident leaves Leo mute and his devout Amish mother refuses surgery. As an adult in 2035, he works as a bartender at a Berlin strip club owned by Maksim and dates cocktail waitress Naadirah. She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses. An anonymous text message leads Leo to a black-market bazaar run by Stuart. Bill and Josie are there, and Bill takes Josie away as Stuart confronts Leo. Suddenly remembering that Naadirah wrote an address on his notepad a while back, Leo leaves the bazaar after using charcoal to read the imprint. Naadirah's address leads Leo to Oswald. When Leo expresses interest in a picture of Naadirah, Oswald assumes Leo works for Maksim's underling Nicky Simsek, who is skimming money from Maksim's prostitutes.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who was given into marriage when she was 15?, using the article: Barbara Holper was the daughter of Hieronymus Holper, under whom Albrecht the Elder served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith. The two men became friends, and when she came of age Holper gave his daughter into marriage when Dürer senior was 40 and she was 15. The couple were compatible, well-matched and fond of each other. Yet their son's writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks; three of their 18 children survived into adulthood – 17 of whom had been born by the time of this portrait. After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son. After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote \\"This my pious Mother ... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. Also she died hard ... I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it.\\" Barbara is shown wearing a red dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, indicating her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, the bridge of her nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been \\"comely and of erect bearing\\". However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the imprimatura.

Answer choices: - As many times as it likes - massive damage - No times - An infinite number of times - heat produced - during the day - Temperature changing - A set number of times A:","completion":"Cells are programmed to split into parts a set number of times. This answer choice is based on a concept known as the Hayflick limit, which is a theory in biology. The Hayflick limit refers to the finite number of times that a normal cell population can divide before they stop proliferating and enter a state known as cellular senescence. This finite number of cell divisions is strongly influenced by various factors, including the species, cell type, and their genetic makeup. For most human cells, the Hayflick limit is estimated to be around 50 to 70 cell divisions. Once the cells reach their limit, they no longer have the ability to divide and contribute to tissue repair or respond to injury; hence, they might undergo apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, or might persist in a dormant state called cellular senescence. In addition to biological factors, environmental conditions, and various external influences, such as exposure to toxins, radiation, or stress, can also alter the number of times a cell can divide. However, it is important to remember that the Hayflick limit applies mainly to somatic (non-sex) cells, and the number of cell divisions may be different for other specialized cells, such as germ cells or stem cells. Some exceptions to the Hayflick limit include immortalized cell lines, such as cancer cells, which have acquired mutations that allow them to bypass the normal aging process and continue dividing indefinitely. Additionally, certain types of stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells, have enhanced regenerative capabilities and can divide for more extended periods compared to their somatic counterparts. In conclusion, the number of times that cells can split into parts is not infinite nor can they do so as many times as they like. Instead, it is limited by the Hayflick limit, which dictates a set number of times that cells can divide before they lose their capacity to proliferate. This limit is influenced by an array of biological and environmental factors that can impact the division capabilities of cells."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Dawn of Victory is the third album studio released by Rhapsody in 2000 . Like the previous albums , it centers on the story of Algalord and The Emerald Sword Saga . It has been produced and engineered by Sascha Paeth and Miro . It is also the first album to feature current drummer Alex Holzwarth . - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material.

Yes are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968 by singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford. The band have undergone numerous formations throughout their history; nineteen musicians have been full-time members. Since June 2015, it has consisted of guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, keyboardist Geoff Downes, singer Jon Davison, and bassist Billy Sherwood, with no remaining founding members. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years, and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers. In 2001, Yes released their nineteenth studio album Magnification. Recorded without a keyboardist, the album features a 60-piece orchestra conducted by Larry Groupe; the first time the band used an orchestra since Time and a Word in 1970. The record was not a chart success; it peaked at number 71 in the UK and number 186 in the US. The Yes Symphonic Tour ran from July to December 2001 and had the band performing on stage with an orchestra and American keyboardist Tom Brislin. Their two shows in Amsterdam were recorded for their 2002 DVD and 2009 CD release Symphonic Live. The band invited Wakeman to play with them for the filming, but he was on a solo tour at the time. Following Wakeman's announcement of his return in April 2002, Yes embarked on their Full Circle Tour in 2002-2003 that included their first performances in Australia since 1973. The triple compilation album The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection was released in July 2003, reaching number 10 in the UK charts, their highest-charting album since 1991, and number 131 in the US. On 26 January 2004, the film Yesspeak premiered in a number of select theatres, followed by a closed-circuit live acoustic performance of the group that was released as Yes Acoustic: Guaranteed No Hiss later on. A 35th anniversary tour followed in 2004 which was documented on the live DVD Songs from Tsongas. In 2004, Squire, Howe, and White reunited for one night only with former members Trevor Horn, Trevor Rabin and Geoff Downes during a show celebrating Horn's career, performing three Yes songs. The show video was released in DVD in 2008 under the name Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to the Rhythm. On 18 March 2003 minor planet (7707) Yes was named in honour of the band.","completion":"This text is about an English progressive rock band called Yes.

Many of songs tell about the lives of famers . They talk about love, crops or death. The life of the countryside can be hard, so the words in country music are often sad. At first, people played the music only at family parties. But it became more popular later. In the 1920s,people played country songs on the radio, and they made them into records. When people in the countryside moved to towns and cities to look for work, they took their music with them. Country music continued to change and became popular across America.

Our equation looks like this: 2120*k - 2179*k + 1593 = 0. We want to find the value of k that makes this equation true. Let's do some rearranging! First, let's deal with the terms that have k in them. We have 2120*k and -2179*k. We need to subtract 2179*k from 2120*k. So, it becomes: -59*k + 1593 = 0 Now, we want to isolate k, which means we want k to be alone on one side of the equation. Let's move 1593 to the other side to make it simpler. To do that, we'll subtract 1593 from both sides: -59*k = -1593 Now, we'll get k alone by dividing both sides by -59: k = -1593 / -59 If we do that division, we find out that: k = 27 So, the value of k that makes the equation true is 27.

Here are possible answers to this question: - mobile phone - wristwatch - briefcase - office - desktop I believe the correct choice is \\"wristwatch\\", here's why:","completion":"The correct answer is indeed \\"wristwatch,\\" and the reason behind this choice is rooted in the historical context and advancement of technology. During the 1970s and 1980s, when the digital watch industry was becoming popular, watch manufacturers were in a race to create new and innovative timepieces that would appeal to customers. In this era, calculators were emerging as indispensable tools, with their applications ranging from academic environments to engineering and finance. The idea of having immediate access to a calculator at one's fingertips was enticing, and the merging of these two useful technologies into a single device was seen as the epitome of modern and futuristic design. The development of calculator watches emerged from this context, and several prominent watch manufacturers (like Casio and Hewlett-Packard) released their versions of these cutting-edge timepieces. These watches typically featured an LCD screen, a number pad for inputting digits and basic mathematical functions, and the capacity to perform arithmetic calculations. The combination of these features allowed users to enjoy both the functionality of a wristwatch and a handy calculator. While it may seem archaic or quaint by today's standards, the calculator wristwatch was a marvel of its time. Owning one was considered impressive, as it signaled that the wearer was technologically savvy and up-to-date with the latest trends. It also provided a certain level of convenience that was unprecedented at the time, allowing users to perform calculations on-the-go without having to carry around a bulky, separate calculator. In contrast, the other options provided (mobile phone, briefcase, office, and desktop) do not fit the context of the question as well. While mobile phones have become the epitome of convenience and multifunctionality in recent decades, their widespread use and adoption did not occur until the late 1990s and early 2000s, well after the advent of calculator wristwatches. Briefcases, offices, and desktops are all locations or objects where a person might place a calculator, but they do not represent a specific technological advancement as a calculator wristwatch does. Today, smartwatches, smartphones, and other portable electronics have replaced the need for a standalone calculator device or a calculator wristwatch. However, the cultural impact and historical significance of the calculator wristwatch as a cutting-edge technological innovation should not be underestimated. It served as a fascinating milestone in the evolution of personal electronics and wearable technology, paving the way for the myriad advanced timepieces and devices we enjoy today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

Summarize: Deadly clashes erupted in Mosul on 6 June, when militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), an al-Qaeda breakaway, launched an assault on the northern city with allied Sunni Arab tribesmen. On Monday, the governor of Nineveh province urged residents to \\"stand firm\\". But within hours, Atheel al-Nujaifi was forced to flee before the provincial government's headquarters was overrun by hundreds of men armed with rocket-propelled grenades, sniper rifles and machine-guns. By Tuesday, tens of thousands of residents had left for the nearby Kurdish-controlled region as the militants seized Mosul's airport, army operations centre and other installations. They also set fire to police stations and freed hundreds of detainees. Police and soldiers dropped their weapons and abandoned their posts as the assault became a rout. Convoys of militants moved southwards on Wednesday, first attacking the town of Baiji and then reportedly overrunning Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, the administrative capital of Salahuddin province. In pictures: Iraqis flee Mosul Profile: Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) Mosul is the second city to fall to ISIS this year, after Falluja. However, its loss is much more serious for the government, as it is the main city of northern Iraq and a major political and economic centre, with a population of 1.8 million. It is also a gateway to Syria and Turkey. After the US-led invasion in 2003, Mosul became a bastion of resistance to the occupation, which its Sunni Arab majority opposed and Kurdish minority supported. Years of bombings and shootings by militants linked to al-Qaeda led to an exodus of thousands of people. It was not until 2009 that a semblance of normality returned to Mosul, but jihadists maintained a firm hold. Sectarian violence increased after US troops withdrew in 2011. It has surged since early 2013 when Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's government launched an offensive against ISIS while also moving against Sunni opposition figures and protesters. Analysis: How to recover Iraq's second city Paragliding in Mosul, a way to shake off recent past The prime minister has pressed parliament to declare a 30-day state of emergency that would give security forces the \\"necessary powers\\" to regain control. A vote will be held on Thursday. Mr Maliki also said citizens would be armed to fight the militants. The sudden collapse of the security forces in Mosul alarmed the US. It called on the Iraqi government to \\"step up to the plate\\", warning that ISIS was \\"a threat to the entire region\\". It pledged to help Baghdad \\"push back this aggression\\". The Iraqi government is believed to have about 930,000 security personnel under its command, so on paper they ought to be able to easily overcome the hundreds of militants who attacked Mosul. However, the same might have been said in late December after ISIS militants and allied tribesmen seized parts of Ramadi, the capital of the western province of Anbar, and most of the nearby city of Falluja amid clashes triggered by the clearance of two protest camps. Mr Maliki has vowed to crush the militants, but they are still in control six months on, holding off troops. The UN says the fighting in Anbar has displaced some 480,000 people. Soldiers have become disillusioned by the conflict against ISIS and brutal attacks by the group - including beheadings and crucifixions - leading many to desert. Commanders told the New York Times they were losing as many as 300 soldiers a day to desertions, deaths and injuries. Analysis: Anbar violence goes beyond sectarian conflict Violence in Iraq sparks new sectarian displacement Quick guide: Sunnis and Shias In 2009, then CIA Director Michael Hayden said al-Qaeda was \\"on the verge of a strategic defeat in Iraq\\". Today, its successor controls territories stretching for hundreds of miles through Nineveh, Anbar and into Syria, where it hopes to establish an Islamic state. ISIS has gained strength and momentum from the situation in Syria, from where it has transferred recruits, sophisticated weapons and resources to fight in Iraq since 2012. It has also skilfully exploited the political stand-off between the central government and the minority Sunni Arab community, which complains that Mr Maliki is monopolising power and targeting them by pursuing policies like the mass arrests in the name of fighting terrorism.

They continued to advance toward the towns of Baiji and Tikrit. The prime minister has asked parliament to declare a 30-day state of emergency to strengthen security forces.

But long after everyone has forgotten who won the statues, it will be remembered as one of film's most stylish and electrifying wake-up calls. 4. A blistering, thought-provoking modern masterpiece. 5. With Traffic, his most ambitious and complex film to date, Soderbergh again proves himself one of our most inventive filmmakers. 6.

When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons. Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king for pardoning her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to \\"free\\" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer.

Bowen stalks another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) to its cave, however the confrontation ends in a stalemate. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen calls the dragon Draco, after the constellation.

Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

Harry makes a modest living chartering his fishing boat to tourists, along with his unofficial mate Eddie.

At his hotel home, hotel owner Gérard (known as \\"Frenchy\\" to English speakers) urges Harry to help the French Resistance by smuggling some people off the island. Harry steadfastly refuses, choosing to keep aloof from the current political situation. Also at the hotel, he meets Marie Browning, a young American wanderer who has recently arrived in Martinique.

It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them.

Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van.

A preliminary hearing is set for July 13.District Attorney Tom Hogan said at a news conference on Sunday morning that Desper surrendered around 2 a.m.Desper's red pickup truck, which was seen on surveillance video, was located in Glen Mills. Only Action News was there at West Goshen Township police headquarters when the truck was hauled in.Detectives also recovered the 40-caliber semi-automatic handgun they believe was used to shoot Roberson in the head. It was found in Desper's bedroom, authorities say.Hogan said Desper has a permit to carry the weapon.The shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday where Route 100 and Route 202 merge in West Goshen Twp., Chester County. Desper and Roberson were trying to merge into the same lane.\\"This is the story of a savage and senseless murder. Someone didn't want her to merge into a lane of traffic,\\" Hogan said.Highway cameras reveal Roberson and the pickup driver had some sort of altercation minutes before the shooting.\\"As Bianca was merging from two lanes to one, there was a man in a red pick up truck also merging down and they jockeyed for position and he wasn't happy,\\" Hogan said. \\"So he pulled out a gun and shot Bianca in the head, killing her instantly.\\"Cameras showed the driver of the red pickup, identified as Desper, fleeing toward Paoli Pike.\\"They were jostling for a position or whatever. And unfortunately this gentleman took it to a degree that was just unconscionable,\\" said West Goshen Police Chief Joe Gleason in a news conference earlier this week.After the shooting, Roberson's car went off the highway and struck a tree.Multiple photos and videos of the red pickup truck were released to the media in the days since the shooting. Authorities say those images led to numerous tips from the public.Hogan said that there was no indication that race was a factor in the slaying.\\"This appears to be a savage, senseless and brutal act from one human being to another human being,\\" he said.Family and neighbors reacted with tears and shock Sunday after the announcement of the arrest of David Desper.Neighbor Gerry Szper said, \\"I didn't interact with him much...just surprising that things like this happen.Bianca's brother spoke to Action News with mix feelings hearing his baby sister's alleged killer was caught.\\"I feel that I would feel relief or excited and happy. I was happy, but I felt down, thinking about that's the truck alongside my sister, her last moments of life,\\" Dontae Alburg said.Roberson was a recent graduate of Bayard Rustin High School in West Chester and was set to attend Jacksonville University in the fall. Her brother told Action News she was \\"headed for greatness.\\"This is just the latest tragedy for Roberson's family. Four years ago, they lost Bianca's older brother.Family members say when Wednesday's crash happened, Roberson had just left an area mall. She was shopping for college clothes with her mother and grandmother.\\"I hope it's not Bianca.\\" That's what the teen's grandmother said to herself as she passed the crash site Wednesday, intending to meet up with her granddaughter at home.She had no idea the traffic backup she was sitting in was caused by the crash involving her granddaughter.\\"Not one bit,\\" added Aunt Mari Hatton-Hayes. \\"And then when she saw the police she said she had this crazy feeling.\\"Police were already at the house to notify Roberson's family that she had died at the scene.\\"She's so young. And to go through something like that by herself.... She had to have been pretty scared,\\" said Dontae Alburg, Bianca's brother.The community is responding to the death of the college bound teen, as dozens came to a vigil in her honor Friday. On Saturday, members of a local brewing company who have never met Bianca felt compelled to help.They collected donations and were donating proceeds from their best selling beer for Bianca's family.Joel Sprick of Levante Brewing Company of West Goshen Township said, \\"We wanted to give back to the community and show our support.---------- ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A 28-year-old man, David Desper, has been charged with the road rage shooting of 18-year-old Bianca Roberson in West Goshen Township, Pennsylvania.

The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group. In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy. Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups.","completion":"The full name of the person that changes their song last minute is Edna Buxton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is forced to explain the nature of death? Movie title: The Iron Giant Movie plot: In 1957, a large alien robot crashes from orbit near the coast of Rockwell, Maine with no memory. Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate. Once Mansley and Rogard are gone, Hogarth plays with the Giant using a toy gun, but inadvertently causes the Giant to activate a defence mechanism.

Do not look for the Danteum in the Eternal City. In true Dantean form, politics stood in the way of its construction in 1938. Ironically this literature-inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form. Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music. Did Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song? Certainly a cold-poem seems artistically repulsive. Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too. While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non-literary work. The Danteum would not be a stage set, rather Terragni generated his design from the Comedy's structure, not its finishes.

He rushed into the classical music scene at the age of 12 after Itzhak Perlman, the famed violinist, heard him play. But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent. And that's typical, Ellen Winner, a professor says. \\"People are fascinated by these children because they don't understand where their talent came from. You will see parents who say, 'I wasn't like this, and my husband wasn't like this.' It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue,\\" Winner says. It's not clear whether a prodigy's brain is any different from the brains of other children, in part because there have been no study comparing the brains of prodigies to those of average people. \\"But I believe that anything that shows up so early, without training, has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis,\\" Winner says. \\"If a child suddenly at the age of 3 goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully, that has to be because that child has a different brain.\\" Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different, too, Winner says. \\"They feel like they can't find other kids like themselves, so they feel strange, maybe even like a freak, and feel like they don't have anybody to connect with.

Please answer the following question: Different wavelength electromagnetic radiations have different uses. John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C. Which wavelengths would be longer, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In order to address this question, let us first understand the electromagnetic spectrum and the wavelengths associated with microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation and is arranged from the lowest frequency (longest wavelength) to the highest frequency (shortest wavelength). The main categories of electromagnetic radiation, ordered from low frequency to high frequency, are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays. Now let us discuss the three cases John has selected for his experiments: Case A: Microwaves Microwaves fall in the range of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than infrared light but shorter than radio waves. Their wavelengths range from 1 millimeter (mm) to 1 meter (m). Microwaves are commonly used in technology such as radar, satellite communication, and, of course, microwave ovens. Microwaves can penetrate through materials like glass, plastic, and ceramics, making them suitable for heating food and liquids. Case B: Infrared Light Infrared light is located between microwaves and visible light in the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelengths of infrared light range from about 750 nanometers (nm) to 1 millimeter (mm), placing them between microwaves and visible light. Infrared light is used in a variety of applications, including thermal imaging, remote control devices, night-vision equipment, and fiber-optic communication systems. Infrared radiation is also emitted by warm objects like humans and other animals, making it an effective tool for detecting heat signatures and temperature differences in various environments. Case C: Visible Light Visible light occupies a small section of the electromagnetic spectrum between infrared light and ultraviolet light, with wavelengths ranging from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nanometers (nm). This range of wavelengths is called the visible spectrum because it is the part of the spectrum that human eyes can detect, allowing us to see color. Visible light has many applications in our daily life, including illumination, communication, and information processing. Now, to answer your question of which case would have a longer wavelength, comparing Case A (Microwaves) and Case B (Infrared Light): Microwaves (Case A) have wavelengths ranging from 1 mm to 1 m while infrared light (Case B) has wavelengths ranging from 750 nm to 1 mm. Since 1 mm to 1 m is a longer range when compared to 750 nm to 1 mm, the wavelengths for microwaves (Case A) are longer than those of infrared light (Case B)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bio: pope peter iii of alexandria also known as mongus -lrb- from the greek μογγός \`\` mongos '' , \`\` stammerer '' -rrb- was the 27th pope of alexandria & patriarch of the see of st. mark . A:","completion":"From the given bio, we can gather several details about Pope Peter III of Alexandria, also known as Mongus. 1. Name and nickname: His name is Peter III, and he is also referred to as Mongus due to his nickname. The Greek word \\"μογγός\\" which translates to \\"mongos\\" means \\"stammerer.\\" This nickname suggests that he might have had a speech impediment, specifically a stammer or stutter. 2. Title and position: He held the title of Pope of Alexandria and was the 27th person to hold this position. Being the Pope of Alexandria means he was the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church and held significant religious authority in Egypt and beyond. This position makes him an essential figure in the history of the Coptic Church. 3. Connection to the See of St. Mark: Pope Peter III was not only the Pope of Alexandria, but he was also the Patriarch of the See of St. Mark. This indicates his role as the spiritual leader of the Alexandrian Church, which was founded by St. Mark, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ. As the Patriarch of the See of St. Mark, his role extended beyond Egypt, encompassing the spiritual leadership and responsibility for the members of the Alexandrian Church throughout Africa and the Middle East. 4. Historical context of his papacy: By mentioning that Peter III was the 27th Pope of Alexandria, we can place his leadership within the context of the Coptic Church's historical timeline. It demonstrates that there were 26 popes before him, each of whom had contributed in some way to the development and growth of the Church. 5. Influence on the Alexandrian Church: As the Pope and Patriarch of the See of St. Mark, Pope Peter III would have had significant influence on the governance, direction, and doctrine of the Alexandrian Church at his time. He likely played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Church's teachings were preserved and passed down to future generations, and in setting the Church's policies and practices in line with its religious principles. Overall, the bio of Pope Peter III of Alexandria (Mongus) offers details about his name and nickname, his religious title and position, the spiritual community he led, the historical context of his leadership, and the impact he had on the Alexandrian Church."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Faber was born on a farm near Cascade, Iowa, on September 6, 1888. He was of Luxembourgish ancestry. While Faber was a child, his father managed a tavern and later ran the Hotel Faber in Cascade. His father became one of the wealthiest citizens in Cascade. Faber enjoyed the greatest success of his career in the early 1920s. The live-ball era was beginning, but he was among the pitchers who made the most successful transition. The spitball was phased out after the 1920 season, with Faber one of the 17 pitchers permitted to use it for the remainder of their careers. He took advantage of Comiskey Park's spacious dimensions, surrendering only 91 home runs--barely one homer per month--from 1920 to 1931. He was one of only six pitchers to win 100 or more games in both the \\"dead ball\\" (through 1920) and live ball eras. Faber finished the 1920 season with 23 wins and led the league in games started. During the summer of 1921, Faber and several other players had to leave a road trip in Washington after receiving subpoenas for the Black Sox trial in Chicago. Faber made the trip but was not asked to testify and he returned to the White Sox without missing a start. In 1921 and 1922, he posted win totals of 25 and 21, respectively, leading the league in ERA (1921-1922), innings (1922) and complete games (1921-1922). He was also among the league leaders in strikeouts each year, while pitching at least 25 complete games and over 300 innings. In the wake of the Black Sox scandal, winning on a consistent basis became increasingly difficult. After being one of the top teams in the league with a powerful offense in the late 1910s, the White Sox had only two winning seasons in his last 13 years, never finishing above fifth place. In the 1921 season, he earned a 25-15 win-loss record for the post-scandal team that limped to a 62-92 finish; from 1921 to 1929 his record was 126-103. In 1927, Ty Cobb had a 21-game hitting streak which was broken when he faced Faber. Despite the widespread hitting of the era, he did not post an ERA over 3.88 until he was 41. Perhaps his last great performance was a one-hitter at age 40 in 1929.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Operation Dragoon preceded the Allied Lorraine Campaign in Northern France in August 1944, after failing to be executed in conjunction with which famous Allied military operation in Normandy? A:","completion":"Operation Dragoon, originally known as Operation Anvil, was the code name for the Allied invasion of Southern France during World War II. This operation took place on August 15, 1944, and was significant in liberating France from the Axis powers and advancing towards Germany. The Allied Lorraine Campaign, also known as Operation Lorraine, was launched on September 1, 1944, with the aim of driving the Germans from the remaining portions of northern France and securing the strategic Moselle River crossings. Operation Dragoon was initially intended to be executed in conjunction with the famous Allied military operation in Normandy, known as Operation Overlord. Operation Overlord, which began on June 6, 1944, was a large-scale invasion of German-occupied western Europe and marked the beginning of the final phase of the war. It involved the coordination of approximately 156,000 troops, including American, British, and Canadian forces, and eventually led to the successful establishment of a foothold in Normandy, France. Operation Dragoon was initially planned as a simultaneous operation with Overlord to divert German forces and ensure a quicker liberation of France. However, there were several reasons why it failed to be executed concurrently with Operation Overlord. 1. Limited resources and availability of troops: Logistical issues played a significant role in delaying Operation Dragoon, as there were limited troops and landing craft available for both operations. The priority was given to Operation Overlord due to its strategic importance, and resources were redirected accordingly. 2. Strategic debates among the Allied leadership: There was disagreement among the Allied leaders on the necessity and timing of Operation Dragoon. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was skeptical about the invasion of Southern France, advocating instead for an increased focus on the Italian Campaign and the Balkans. On the other hand, American military leaders, such as General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, favored a two-pronged attack on France through both Normandy and the Mediterranean. 3. The need to maintain surprise: The simultaneous launching of two major operations might have alerted the German High Command and increased their preparedness, undermining the element of surprise, which was crucial to the success of Operation Overlord. Despite the delay, the execution of Operation Dragoon in August 1944 proved to be an essential component of the Allied victory in Europe. It led to the swift liberation of southern France, forcing German forces to retreat and ultimately linking up with the Allied troops advancing from Normandy. This allowed the Allies to launch a unified campaign in northern France, including the Lorraine Campaign, which played a crucial part in securing a vital strategic location and ultimately weakening the German war effort."},{"prompt":"Title: Christy's a genius!

Water is used as the vehicle for the pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall. The word fresco is derived from the Italian adjective \\"fresco\\" meaning \\"fresh\\", and may thus be contrasted with fresco-secco or secco mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco. The fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with Italian Renaissance painting. - Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt (14 November 1668 16 November 1745) was an Austrian baroque architect and military engineer who designed stately buildings and churches and whose work had a profound influence on the architecture of the Habsburg Empire in the eighteenth century. After studying in Rome under Carlo Fontana, he constructed fortresses for Prince Eugene of Savoy during his Italian campaigns, becoming his favorite architect. In 1700 he became court engineer in Vienna, and in 1711 was named head of the court department of building. He became court architect in 1723. His designs for palaces, estates, gardens, churches, chapels, and villas were widely imitated, and his architectural principles spread throughout central and southeast Europe. Among his more important works are Palais Schwarzenberg, St. Peter's Church, and Belvedere in Vienna, Savoy Castle in Ráckeve, Schönborn Palace in Göllersdorf, and Schloss Hof. - The Würzburg Residence (German: \\"Würzburger Residenz\\") is a palace in Würzburg, Germany. Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and Maximilian von Welsch, representatives of the Austrian/South German Baroque style, were involved in the construction, as well as Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand, who were followers of the French Style. Balthasar Neumann, court architect of the Bishop of Würzburg, was the principal architect of the Residence, which was commissioned by the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn and his brother Friedrich Carl von Schönborn in 1720, and completed in 1744.

With most stores in China either closed or operating at reduced hours, sales of Apple products would be lower, the company said. Apple said that \\"while our iPhone manufacturing partner sites are located outside the Hubei province - and while all of these facilities have reopened - they are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated. \\"All of our stores in China and many of our partner stores have been closed,\\" it added. \\"Additionally, stores that are open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic. We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can.\\" Analysts have estimated that the virus may slash demand for smartphones by half in the first quarter in China, which is the world's biggest market for the devices.

He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Input: CONTEXT: Historia En 1922, una expedición del Museo Americano de Historia Natural al desierto de Gobi en Mongolia, desenterró el primer fósil de Velociraptor conocido. Un cráneo quebrado y aplastado pero completo, junto con una de las dos garras curvas de la pata. Dos años después, el presidente del museo Henry Fairfield Osborn mencionó al animal en un artículo, bajo el nombre Ovoraptor djadochtari (no se confunda con otro género de nombre parecido: Oviraptor). Pero debido a que el nombre Ovoraptor no había sido publicado en un diario científico o acompañado con una descripción formal, permaneció como un nomen nudum («nombre desnudo») y el nombre Velociraptor conservó la prioridad. Posteriormente durante ese año, Osborn designó el cráneo y la garra (la cual supuso que era de la mano) como el espécimen tipo del nuevo género Velociraptor. Su nombre se deriva del latín: velox, velocis (la última forma -el genitivo- es de la que deriva la denominación del animal) (que significa «ágil» o «rápido») y raptor (que significa «ladrón») y se refiere a la alimentación carnívora y a la naturaleza de corredor del animal. Este último rasgo resultaba contradictorio con la idea de dinosaurios lentos y poco inteligentes que solía esgrimirse en aquella época.

A marching band is a group in which instrumental musicians perform while marching, often for entertainment or competition. Instrumentation typically includes brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. Most marching bands wear a uniform, often of a military style, that includes an associated school or organization's colors, name or symbol. Most high school marching bands, and some college marching bands, are accompanied by a color guard, a group of performers who add a visual interpretation to the music through the use of props, most often flags and rifles. Traditional Style bands, also known as Show Bands, are marching bands geared primarily towards crowd entertainment and perform on football fields. Typically, they perform a routine before the game, another at halftime, and sometimes after the game as well. Competitive show bands perform only one show that is continually refined throughout a season, while bands that focus on entertainment rather than competition usually perform a unique show for each game. These shows normally consists of three to five musical pieces accompanied by formations rooted in origin from Patterns in Motion, a book penned by band director William C. \\"Bill\\" Moffit, bandmaster of Purdue University All-American Marching Band and University of Houston Spirit of Houston. A recognizable style of show band is the one fielded by historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). HBCU bands utilize the traditional \\"ankle-knee\\" high step and music selections are largely based on R&B, hip-hop, and contemporary popular music. In addition to traditional drill formations, HBCU bands feature heavily choreographed dance routines as part of their performances. Many of these bands may have a twirler line and/or a dancer line, but not necessarily flag twirlers. One of the most notable depictions of HBCU bands is the film Drumline. HBCU bands are a significant part of African-American musical culture and HBCU bands often surpass their associated football teams in popularity, a phenomenon that is uncommon among collegiate and high school marching bands. In 1989, as part of the celebrations for the bicentennial of the French Revolution, the Florida A&M University Marching 100, one of the most prolific HBCU bands in the country, was selected as the official representative of the United States in the bicentennial parade. Another style of show band is that used by many of the Big Ten Conference marching bands, a semi-military and semi-corps style. These bands perform a show that is designed to entertain the audience, but feature more traditional symphonic styles of music (marches, film scores, jazz, or older pop music) as well as some contemporary music. Big Ten style show bands have been influential in creating some of the earliest marching band innovations, and the style is used in high schools throughout much of the United States. Most show bands of either type include the traditional military band instrumentation of woodwinds, brass, and battery percussion. Some also include the front ensemble keyboard percussion, and may also incorporate the use of a color guard for flag, and rifle routines as well as a dance line.

The school principal implemented a dress code. effect:","completion":"To describe the effects of the school principal implementing a dress code, I will consider various potential impacts this could have on the school community. 1. Improved School Spirit and Unity: Implementing a dress code could increase school spirit and unity by making students feel part of one community. This could potentially result in a stronger sense of belonging and togetherness among students. 2. Diminished Socio-Economic Differences: A common dress code can equalize students in terms of visible displays of socio-economic status. If everyone wears the same clothes, differences in clothing brands and quality, which can be tied to personal wealth, are hidden, possibly leading to less division or bullying over such things. 3. Enhanced Focus on Education: By limiting choices of dress, the school may help students avoid distractions related to fashion trends or competition, which could result in increased focus on education. 4. Reduced Individual Expression: On the downside, implementing a dress code could limit students' self-expression. Schools are places where students learn and grow, and part of that growth involves expressing themselves in their attire. 5. Possible Resistance from Students or Parents: Not all students or their parents might agree with the dress code policy. This disagreement might manifest itself in a form of protest or increased dissatisfaction, possibly affecting the school climate negatively. 6. Increased Financial Burden: While a uniform could potentially level the economic playing field in one way, it might also create additional burdens for some families who struggle with the cost of uniforms. 7. Easier Identification of Non-students: With a standardized student look, it would be easier for school security to identify individuals who do not belong on campus, thus potentially increasing safety. These steps of thinking are based on different perspectives, taking into account both the potential positive and negative effects of such a policy change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: This upbringing created an \\"invincible determination\\" which saw him spend 50 years providing healthcare and education for Chinese peasants living in similar poverty. The \\"enormous legacy\\" he left behind in the far east includes hospitals, churches and schools - many of which are now major research centres serving millions of people. To mark 150 years since he founded Union Hospital in Wuhan, a committee was formed to help send an exhibition on his life to the city. About Â£20,000 is needed and more than 400 people recently attended a Chinese New Year fundraiser at the Brangwyn Hall in Swansea. About half the figure was raised and the plan is to ship the exhibits to China in September ahead of the anniversary in October. He was described as simply \\"a remarkable man\\" by retired university lecturer and chairman of the Griffith John Committee, Dr Vernon Williams. The Swansea where Mr John was born in 1831 was experiencing rapid industrial growth, with disease spread by the River Tawe leading to frequent outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever and cholera. These claimed the lives of his mother when he was eight months and his father when he was 17. At the time, 15 people would live in two-room houses and with no schools, Mr John would have been expected to follow his father to work in the copper industry. Religion, though, played a major role and he learnt to read his native Welsh by studying religious scriptures at Ebenezer Congregational Chapel. Mr John became known as \\"the boy preacher\\" as he gave readings around the Neath and Swansea valleys as a teenager. But it was after he gained a place at Brecon Memorial College in 1850 that perhaps his path towards China was set. While there, he heard an address by a missionary who had been to Madagascar, which left him determined to enter the field. He headed to Shanghai with his wife Margaret in 1855, where he spent four years preaching after learning the language in six months. \\"Griffith John was brought up in a greatly over-crowded, impoverished borough, where illness and disease, particularly cholera, and squalor were rampant,\\" said Dr Williams. \\"This most definitely, as a Christian minister, would have had a profound effect on him and seeing that again, in then the poorest part of China, seems to have motivated him into action.\\" After moving up the Yangtze River, Mr John set up his base in Hankow (now Wuhan). \\"He was a great visionary not only in his mission work but also in providing schools and hospitals when there were very few, if any, in Swansea at that time,\\" he added. Conditions were tough, but Dr Williams described Mr John as \\"short and stockily built, possessing a single-mindedness, great courage and invincible determination\\". This allowed him to survive extremely hot summers and intense humidity that claimed the lives of his first wife Margaret (in 1873) and second wife Jeanette (in 1885). By 1900, Mr John had helped set up a number of boys and girls schools and a teacher training college, meaning education in the area was thought to be 30 years ahead of the rest of China. He also built about 10 hospitals, preached daily and distributed more than six million of his religious translations. But after a number of strokes, he died \\"a frail and burned-out man\\" in London in 1912, when his body was returned home. \\"Griffith John was extremely well know in his day in Swansea with over 2,000 people attending his funeral. \\"In the 1960s, a block of flats was erected in Greenhill in the location where he was born and these and the adjacent street were named after him. \\"However, as is common place with time, memories fade somewhat,\\" Dr Williams added. While he described Mr John as \\"one of the great sons of Swansea who left an enormous legacy in central China\\", he slipped out of the wider public consciousness. But an exhibition on his life went on display at Swansea Museum in 2012 followed by a blue plaque on Ebenezer church. The Griffith John Committee his since been set up and fundraising will continue over the coming months to send the exhibits to China. With the country's influence on the Welsh economy set to grow, Cllr Robert Francis-Davies said Swansea wanted to strengthen \\"a cultural link that goes back to the 1850s\\". Local businessman Chris Foxall is another driving force and said Mr John's \\"tireless work\\" means the city has a \\"special relationship\\" with the Asian country.

A:","completion":"A: The stop-motion animated musical dark fantasy film directed by Henry Selick, and produced and conceived by Tim Burton that features Jørgen Klubien's work is \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas.\\" The film was released in 1993 and has since become a classic. Jørgen Klubien was one of the animators and character designers who contributed to the movie's unique and visually captivating style. \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" tells the story of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, who becomes enamored with Christmas and tries to bring Christmas joy to Halloween Town by kidnapping Santa Claus. The film also introduces viewers to the quirky residents of Halloween Town and Jack's love interest, Sally, a ragdoll woman made by a mad scientist. The film is renowned for its artistry, which combines elements of German Expressionism with rich and detailed imagery. Jørgen Klubien's work on the movie, along with the efforts of other animators, brought Tim Burton's vision to life. The stop-motion animation technique utilized in the production required meticulous work, with each frame of the film being carefully orchestrated to create the fluidity of movement on screen. \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" also included an original score and songs composed by Danny Elfman, who provided singing voice for Jack Skellington. The movie's popular songs, such as \\"This is Halloween,\\" \\"Jack's Lament,\\" and \\"What's This?,\\" contribute to its enduring appeal. Acclaimed for its unique storytelling, artistry, and aesthetics, \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" has since gained a cult following over the years and has become a beloved part of the holiday season for many fans, transcending the boundary between Halloween and Christmas."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Bag Tells All All through the baseball playoffs, Mike Tanier will provide the Bats blog with daily updates on less-than-important developments from around the league. Official news conference transcript with third base, Oct. 13, 2011, 9:04 p.m., Central time, Comerica Park. Question: How are you feeling? Third Base: I am doing well. The Tigers’ equipment manager rubbed some liniment oil on my front face where Cabrera’s double hit me, and it feels soft and supple again. I’m a base, you know, so I absorb hits like that all the time when guys step on me or slide into me. Question: After that play, did you interact with Cabrera or Beltre at all? Third Base: Not really. I have gotten to know Adrian over the course of the series, and he is a professional. I know there are no hard feelings. Cabrera stepped on me on the next play, the Victor Martinez triple, but he didn’t say anything, which is unusual considering all of the talking he has done throughout the series. Question: Do you feel any sort of connection with Cabrera? Third Base: I think we have a special relationship. On Wednesday night, he stood on me for an extra two seconds when he should have been tagging up on Delmon Young’s flyout. It was like an old married couple saying goodbye in an airport. I know he used to play third base. Maybe I remind him of some other base. Anyway, we are tied together by history now. Question: Have any other inanimate objects from baseball history reached out to you since the carom play? Third Base: I just got a text from George Brett’s pine tar bat. He said: “Get ready for a media circus!” The left-field foul pole at Fenway also called me. He warned me that Carlton Fisk doesn’t even acknowledge him anymore; that this can be a cruel business, and that people can be fickle. Question: Have you heard from Cooperstown? Third Base: Going in the Hall of Fame would be great, but I was just talking to home plate outside the equipment bag, and he said, “You know what, Detroit is my home.” And when home calls a place home, it really makes you think, you know? Question: Is there any truth to the rumor that you are now dating Kourtney Kardashian’s welcome mat? Third Base: This interview is over! Cruz Missiles: Nelson Cruz set a major league record with five league championship series home runs. In the process, he has officially moved into second place on the career list of baseball players named Cruz. Cruz has been flirting with Jose Cruz Jr. for second place for some time, but with 11 runs batted in in this series, there is no question that he is the more historically significant player. If the Rangers reach the World Series and Cruz stays hot, he could challenge for first place. The all-time Cruz list, as it now stands: First: Jose Cruz. A tremendous line-drive hitter with speed and some power who played his best years in the Astrodome, where you needed a boarding pass and less than 3.4 ounces of toothpaste to reach the warning track. According to some sabermetricians, if Cruz had played in a neutral park, he would have hit 11 trillion home runs. Third: Jose Cruz Jr. Much like his father, plus a smidgen of power but minus about 40 points of batting average. Best known for dropping a routine fly in the 11th inning of the 2003 N.L.C.S., then winning the Gold Glove a few days later. When it comes to the 11th inning of playoff games, it is feast or famine for guys named Cruz. Fourth: Vicente De La Cruz Padilla. A career midrotation starter with a 104-90 record. Padilla was briefly the Phillies’ staff ace in the final days of Veterans Stadium, and fans would wear sombreros and paddle imaginary canoes through uninhabited sections of the ballpark as Padilla’s Flotilla. Shaky cultural sensitivity aside, this is the cleverest thing that happened in Philadelphia in the era between Ben Franklin’s lightning experiments and Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal. Fifth: Julio Cruz. An incredibly light-hitting (career slugging percentage: .299) glove man at second base for the Mariners and the White Sox in the 1980s. Cruz stole 373 career bases. This was before baseball became a giant probabilistic modeling exercise, so you could enjoy a slap-hitting speedster without worrying about how his suboptimal econometric profile was costing your team runs. Was once traded straight up for Tony Bernazard. Sixth: Tommy de la Cruz: A Cuban-born pitcher who got a wartime call-up in 1944, Cruz was 9-9 with a 3.25 E.R.A. as a 32-year-old rookie for the Reds. He was drafted that winter, but enlisted with the Cuban military instead, then pitched in the Mexican League (then an independent minor league that played at a very high level) for several years. He is in the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame. Speaking of Cuban pitchers for the Reds, Ardolis de la Cruz Chapman could also make this list someday, but he has only six wins to Tommy de la Cruz’s nine. Seventh: Mike Stanton. The young Marlins slugger’s full name is Giancarlo Cruz Michael Stanton. So the story goes, Stanton’s name was so mangled by teachers that by fifth grade he shortened it to Mike. The real tragedy here is that Stanton, starting in kindergarten, encountered six college-educated professionals who had trouble pronouncing Giancarlo. Eighth: Delvi Cruz. Batted .302 with 10 homers for the Tigers in his best season. Was last seen playing for the Bridgeport Bluefish five years ago. Another mysterious disappearance into the Connecticut Triangle. Ninth: Heity Cruz. Jose Cruz’s brother and Jose Cruz Jr.’s uncle, Heity finished third in the rookie of the year vote in 1976 with a .228-13-71 line. The bicentennial was a horrible year for National League rookies. (Mark Fidrych, known as the Bird, won it in the American League, so it was really a bad year all around.) Various teams spent the next decade waiting for Heity to turn into his brother, or at least match the awesome power of his 13-homer rookie year. He never did. Tenth: Todd Cruz. A dribble-hitting utility infielder who made Julio Cruz look like Mel Ott. After several seasons of .200-level hitting, Todd somehow wound up the starting third baseman for Earl Weaver’s pennant-winning 1983 Orioles. He batted seventh during the World Series despite a .199 season batting average, which tells you all you need to know about the offensive prowess of the longtime Orioles catcher Rick Dempsey. In Game 2 of the World Series, Cruz singled on a sacrifice attempt, helping the Orioles score the go-ahead run in a fifth-inning rally that became the turning point of the Series. It only goes to show you that no player is too obscure or ineffective to embarrass the Phillies at some point in his career.

To secure the buckle, push the “male” side into the “female” side until you hear a snap, then tug on the closed buckle to make sure it's secure. To unbuckle the belt, simultaneously press down on the tabs at the top and bottom of the closed buckle, and pull the 2 buckle components apart at the same time. As with a standard gait belt, the buckle can cause discomfort if it's positioned directly over the center of the patient's abdomen. Slide it a little to the right or left of center, based on the patient's preference. Some excess belt strap will already be looped through and hanging free from one of the sides of the buckle—typically the “male” side. Pull on the strap until the belt is at the proper tightness around the patient's waist, with the bottom of the belt just touching the tops of the hip bones. You should be able to slide your fingers behind the belt, but not be able to pinch the fabric between your fingers. The excess belt strap can be a tripping hazard, so get it out of the way by tucking it once or more behind the fitted belt. If there is an excessive amount of strapping left, wrap it loosely around the patient's body once or twice (above the fitted belt), then tuck it in.

Background: Stewart Armstrong Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of CIA officer Miles Copeland, Jr. and Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Adie. The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. Context: After the Police disbanded, Copeland established a career composing soundtracks for movies (Airborne, Talk Radio, Wall Street, Riff Raff, Raining Stones, Surviving the Game, See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Highlander II: The Quickening, The Leopard Son, She's Having a Baby, The First Power, Fresh, Taking Care of Business, West Beirut, I am David, Good Burger), television (The Equalizer, Dead Like Me, Star Wars: Droids, the pilot for Babylon 5 (1993), Nickelodeon's The Amanda Show, The Life and Times of Juniper Lee), operas (Holy Blood and Crescent Moon, commissioned by Cleveland Opera) and ballets (Prey' Ballet Oklahoma, Casque of Amontillado, Noah's Ark/Solcheeka, commissioned by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, King Lear, commissioned by the San Francisco Ballet Company, Emilio). Copeland also occasionally played drums for other artists. Peter Gabriel employed Copeland to perform on his songs \\"Red Rain\\" and \\"Big Time\\" from his 1986 album So. He has also performed with Mike Rutherford and Tom Waits. That year he also teamed with Adam Ant to record the title track and video for the Anthony Michael Hall movie Out of Bounds. In 1989, Copeland formed Animal Logic with jazz bassist Stanley Clarke and singer-songwriter Deborah Holland. The trio had success with their first album and world tour but the follow-up recording sold poorly, and the band did not continue. In 1993 he composed the music for Channel 4's Horse Opera and director Bob Baldwin. In 1999, he provided the voice of an additional American soldier in the animated musical comedy war film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999). Question: Did he have more music projects as well? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Stewart Copeland had more music projects. After his time with the band The Police and his work on movie soundtracks, TV shows, operas, and ballets, he continued making music. He joined other bands like Animal Logic, collaborated with famous musicians such as Peter Gabriel and Tom Waits, and worked on different projects like creating music for a Horse Opera and voicing a character in an animated movie called South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.

He was credited with coining the phrase \\"sacking the quarterback\\". In 1999, Jones provided an L.A. Times reporter with some detailed imagery about his forte: \\"You take all the offensive linemen and put them in a burlap bag, and then you take a baseball bat and beat on the bag. You're sacking them, you're bagging them. And that's what you're doing with a quarterback.\\" What separated Jones from every other defensive end was his speed and his ability to make tackles from sideline to sideline, which was unheard of in his time. He also was the first pass rusher to use the head slap, a move that he said was, \\"...to give myself an initial head start on the pass rush, in other words an extra step. Because anytime you go upside a man's head ... or a woman; they may have a tendency to blink they [sic] eyes or close they eyes. And that's all I needed. \\" \\"The head slap was not my invention, but Rembrandt, of course, did not invent painting. The quickness of my hands and the length of my arms, it was perfect for me. It was the greatest thing I ever did, and when I left the game, they outlawed it.\\" Pro Football Weekly reported he accumulated 173 1/2 sacks over his career, which would be third on the all-time sack list. (Jones would have ranked first all-time at the time of his retirement, and since has been surpassed by two fellow Hall of Famers Bruce Smith and Reggie White.) In 1967, Jones had 21 1/2 sacks in only 14 games; he tallied 22 sacks in 14 games the following year. If official, this would have stood as an NFL record until Harvey Martin's 1977 campaign, in which he totaled 23 sacks.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move slower? Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, Group George's cans had the air molecules inside moving slower. This is because Group George vented their cans before heating them, which allowed the release of pressure as the air molecules gained kinetic energy and moved more rapidly due to the heat from the campfire. On the other hand, Group Jones did not vent their cans, leading to a rapid increase in pressure as air molecules moved faster, eventually causing the cans to explode. Their cans experienced a much more significant increase in kinetic energy and faster-moving air molecules due to the lack of pressure release. In summary, air molecules inside Group George's cans moved slower compared to those in Group Jones' cans, as the venting allowed for proper pressure release."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which team didn't observe a stronger warming in spring? Two teams of meteorologists studied environmental changes in Antarctica. Team A studied East Antarctica, while team B studied West Antarctica. They published their findings in a peer reviewed publication. Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature... The answer is:","completion":"Team A did not observe a stronger warming in spring, as they studied East Antarctica.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. I am facing a new situation today: Two researchers studied air quality over the North Pole, and over Antarctica. Dan was more fond of the south pole, so he studied Antarctica, while Colt liked reading about the North Pole. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which researcher learned more about chlorine gases? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it is likely that the researcher who learned more about chlorine gases is Dan. In the background article, it mentions that the ozone layer is being destroyed primarily due to chlorine and bromine gases, which are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. More importantly, it specifies that there is an ozone hole over Antarctica, pointing to significant ozone depletion in that region. As ozone depletion is directly linked to the presence of chlorine and bromine gases, it stands to reason that researching Antarctica would provide more insight into the effects of chlorine gases on the atmosphere. On the other hand, the article doesn't mention any specific details about ozone depletion over the North Pole, which is the region Colt studied. As a result, we cannot draw a conclusion about Colt's findings about chlorine gases in his research area. Therefore, considering that Dan studied Antarctica where the ozone depletion and the presence of chlorine gases are more pronounced, it is safe to conclude that Dan, the researcher focused on Antarctica, likely learned more about chlorine gases in comparison to Colt, who studied the North Pole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: All The Boys Love Mandy Lane Movie plot: At a Texas high school, Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) is an outsider who blossoms over the summer and starts getting a great deal of attention from her male classmates. One of those classmates, Dylan, invites Mandy to a pool party at his house and she accepts with the provision that her best friend, Emmet (Michael Welch) can come along with her. At the party, Dylan attacks Emmet, and holds his head under water in the pool until Mandy intercedes. As revenge, Emmet convinces a drunken Dylan to jump off the roof into the pool, but he hits his head on the cement and dies. Nine months later, Mandy has since befriended many of Dylan's popular friends, while Emmet has been almost completely ostracized and is subjected to even more intense bullying. Stoner Red is having a small party at his father's cattle ranch and invites Mandy along, which she accepts after receiving permission from her aunt. Mandy, Chloe, Bird, Red, Jake, and Marlin, arrive at the ranch, and meet the ranch hand, Garth (Anson Mount). That night, while playing drinking games, Jake gets offended over a joke and storms off to a nearby cattle barn, where Marlin performs oral sex on him. They have another argument, and after he walks off again, Marlin is knocked out with a double-barreled shotgun by an unseen assailant, and has her jaw broken. After getting rebuffed by Mandy while making a move, Jake steals Red's shotgun and pickup truck and goes off in search of Marlin, before finding her sitting by a lake. The hooded killer is revealed to be Emmet, as he wants revenge for all the humiliation he suffered. He shoots Jake in the head and then breaks Marlin's neck with the butt of the shotgun, killing them both. While the remaining friends sit on the house porch, Emmet shoots fireworks at them from Red's truck; Bird gives chase, believing the driver to be Jake.

Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth. One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work. Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and \\"good times\\". The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential.

Vito John Fossella Jr. (born March 9, 1965) is a U.S. Republican politician from the state of New York who formerly represented the state's 13th Congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives for six terms, from 1997 to 2009 serving as the lone Republican from New York City. Fossella, a Staten Island native, was born to a family that included several politicians. Fossella initially took office in 1997, after winning a special election held to replace the resigning Susan Molinari. As a result of a DUI arrest in Alexandria, Virginia on May 1, 2008, followed by the public disclosure a week later that he had had an affair with Laura Fay, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel, that had resulted in a three-year-old child while Fossella was married, he announced on his official website on May 20 that he had chosen to serve out the remainder of his term, which ended on January 3, 2009, but decided not to run for re-election. Before Fossella announced that he would not run in 2008, he was included in the National Republican Congressional Committee's list of Republican candidates who qualified for fundraising help because they were thought to be particularly vulnerable. Steve Harrison hoped to run against Fossella again in the 2008 election, but New York City Council member Domenic Recchia also began seeking the Democratic nomination. For several days after his DWI arrest and his admission of an adulterous affair and fathering an out-of-wedlock child, Fossella gave indications that he might run for re-election despite these problems. On May 20, however, he dropped out of the race. On May 28, the Staten Island Democratic Party endorsed City Councilman Michael E. McMahon for the Democratic nomination, although Harrison said he would remain a candidate in the Democratic primary. On the Republican side, several prominent elected officials considered running but decided against it. On May 29, the Staten Island Republican Party endorsed Frank Powers, a member of the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who had never held elective office but who promised to spend 500,000 of his own money on the race. However, Powers died on June 22. Powers's son (Frank M. Powers) was also in the race, running as a Libertarian; however, the Libertarian Party did not endorse him. Robert Straniere was on the ballot for the Republican Party, and Susan Overeem was the Libertarian Party candidate.

Background: Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (born March 28, 1986), known professionally as Lady Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her unconventionality and provocative work as well as experimentation with new images. Gaga began her musical career performing songs at open mic nights and school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21) through New York University's Tisch School of the Arts before dropping out to become a professional musician. Context: Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986, at the Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York City, to a Catholic family with Italian and French Canadian roots. Her parents are Cynthia Louise (nee Bissett) and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, and she has a younger sister, Natali. Brought up in the affluent Upper West Side of Manhattan, she says that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything. From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private, all-girls Roman Catholic school. Gaga described her academic life in high school as \\"very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined\\" but also \\"a bit insecure\\". She considered herself a misfit among her peers and was mocked for \\"being either too provocative or too eccentric\\". Gaga began to play the piano at the age of four when her mother insisted she become \\"a cultured young woman\\", taking lessons and practicing the instrument throughout her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music and practiced professionally. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music, and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp. As a teenager, she played at open mic nights. At her high school, Gaga played the lead roles of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls and Philia in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years. Gaga unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though appeared in a small role as a high school student in a 2001 episode of The Sopranos titled \\"The Telltale Moozadell\\". She later said of her inclination towards music: I don't know exactly where my affinity for music comes from, but it is the thing that comes easiest to me. When I was like three years old, I may have been even younger, my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano ... I was really, really good at piano, so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano, and I might not have been a natural dancer, but I am a natural musician. That is the thing that I believe I am the greatest at. In 2003, at age 17, Gaga gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21)--a music school at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts--and lived in an NYU dorm. At NYU, she studied music and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues, and politics, including a thesis on pop artists Spencer Tunick and Damien Hirst. During the second semester of her sophomore year in 2005, she withdrew to focus on her music career. The same year, she played an unsuspecting diner customer for MTV's Boiling Points, a prank reality television show. In 2014, Gaga said she had been raped at the age of 19, for which she underwent mental and physical therapy. She has posttraumatic stress disorder that she attributes to the incident, and says that support from doctors, family, and friends has helped her. Question: how did she do there? Answer:","completion":"Lady Gaga did well in her early years. She started playing piano when she was four years old and was very good at it.

Context: LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes.

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"?

But the order was dropped over questions of officials' authority to call for such an action—and the military's ability to even carry out said order, reports Reuters. The report says that during a meeting with select officials, Netanyahu told then-head of the Israeli Defense Forces Gabi Ashkenazi to \\"set the systems for P-plus,\\" a move to prepare for action, the New York Times reports. But Ashkenazi and then-intelligence boss Meir Duggan have called Netanyahu's order an attempt to \\"steal a decision to go to war,\\" reports the AP: They say the prime minister doesn't have the authority to make the command without the full Cabinet's backing. \\"This is not something you do unless you are certain you want to execute at the end. This accordion will make music if you keep playing it,\\" Ashkenazi says. In the TV report, which airs tonight, Barak disagrees, saying that putting systems on alert doesn't mean \\"the state of Israel is compelled to act.\\" And \\"eventually, at the moment of truth, the answer that was given was that, in fact, the ability did not exist,\\" Barak says. The incident in question appears to have occurred around a time when the US and Israel were deeply involved in a mission to delay Iran's nuclear progress and offer a nonmilitary resolution to Israeli-Iranian tensions, the Times notes. Expand this summary.","completion":"In 2010, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak reportedly requested that the military prepare itself to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. According to an Israeli TV report, Netanyahu instructed then-head of the Israeli Defense Forces, Gabi Ashkenazi, to \\"set the systems for P-plus,\\" which is a move toward taking action. However, the order was ultimately dropped due to questions surrounding the authority of officials to call for such a measure and the military's ability to carry out that order. Ashkenazi and then-intelligence chief Meir Duggan have accused Netanyahu of attempting to \\"steal a decision to go to war,\\" stating that the prime minister does not have the power to make this command without the approval of the entire Cabinet. Ashkenazi argued that taking such a step should only occur if there is certainty of execution at the end. In contrast, Barak maintained that putting systems on alert does not compel the state of Israel to act. Barak also acknowledged that, at the essential moment, it was determined that the capacity to act did not exist. This incident seems to have taken place during a period when the United States and Israel were deeply engaged in a mission to delay Iran's nuclear advancements and seek a nonmilitary resolution to the tensions between Israel and Iran. The New York Times notes that this highlights the complexities of the Israeli decision-making process and the ongoing debate about the appropriate approach to combat Iran's nuclear program. The situation also demonstrates the challenges faced by Israel's leadership at the time, as they attempted to navigate the delicate balance between Israel's national security interests and the potential consequences of engaging in military action against Iran. The dropping of the order to attack Iran's nuclear facilities may have been influenced by various factors, including pressure from the United States, concerns over the ability to execute a successful operation, and the realization that unilateral action by Israel could escalate into a broader conflict in the region. In addition, the episode serves as a reminder of the ongoing tensions and potential risks associated with Iran's nuclear program, amid efforts by the international community to curtail the country's nuclear ambitions. The canceled order in 2010 may have contributed to the eventual negotiation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), which sought to restrict Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Overall, this incident underscores the complex interplay of strategy, politics, and diplomacy in addressing the persistent challenges posed by Iran's nuclear program and the broader regional security environment. The decision-making process and the factors that influenced the ultimate outcome provide valuable insights into the potential risks and opportunities associated with similar situations in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It might make up more than 80 per cent of the known universe, but as of yet scientists have still not managed to directly observe one of the universe’s greatest mysteries - dark matter. In recent months there have been detections from the sun and in orbit around Earth, but now scientists think they have found it in neighbouring galaxies. They spotted photon emissions coming from space - and one of the best possible explanations is that they came from particles of dark matter. Scroll down for video explanation. Research led by Leiden University in the Netherlands has found particles in other galaxies that could be dark matter (illustrated). They analysed X-ray signals emitted by the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy. The signal could not be attributed to any regular form of matter. Two groups have recently announced that they have detected a signal that could be a sign of dark matter, with the research to be published next week in Physical Review Letters. One of them, which included Netherlands-based Leiden University scientists Dr Oleg Ruchayskiy and Dr Alexey Boyarsky, found it by analysing X-rays emitted by two celestial objects - the Perseus galaxy cluster and the Andromeda galaxy. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up: the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces.There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light, but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the universe. After having collected thousands of signals from the Esa's XMM-Newton telescope and eliminated all those coming from known particles and atoms, they detected an anomaly that, even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error, caught their attention. The signal appears in the X-ray spectrum as a weak, abnormal photon emission that could not be attributed to any known form of matter. Above all, ‘the signal's distribution within the galaxy corresponds exactly to what we were expecting with dark matter, that is, concentrated and intense in the centre of objects and weaker and diffuse on the edges,’ explained Dr Ruchayskiy. ‘With the goal of verifying our findings, we then looked at data from our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and made the same observations,’ added Dr Boyarsky. The discovery was made using Esa's XMM-Newton telescope (illustration shown). The researchers detected an anomaly that, even considering the possibility of instrument or measurement error, caught their attention - as it could be the best sign of dark matter yet. The signal comes from a very rare event in the universe: a photon emitted due to the destruction of a hypothetical particle, possibly a ‘sterile neutrino’. If the discovery is confirmed, it will open up new avenues of research in particle physics. ‘It could usher in a new era in astronomy,’ said Dr Ruchayskiy. And Dr Boyarsky said: ‘Confirmation of this discovery may lead to construction of new telescopes specially designed for studying the signals from dark matter particles. ‘We will know where to look in order to trace dark structures in space and will be able to reconstruct how the universe has formed.’ The research, to be published in Physical Review Letters, included EPFL scientists Dr Oleg Ruchayskiy and Dr Alexey Boyarsky.

Please answer the following question: Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine. Rob is an auto mechanic. He was checking the radiators of his car and truck. He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather. Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","completion":"In this situation, the truck would fare worse in hot weather and with a hot engine because Rob did not put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. Since antifreeze not only acts as a freezing point depressant but also raises the boiling point of the water in the car radiator, it plays a crucial role in preventing the engine from overheating in high-temperature conditions. Without antifreeze, the water in the truck radiator would only have a boiling point of 100 °C (boiling point of pure water). Considering the hot weather and a hot engine, the water in the truck radiator is more likely to reach and surpass this boiling point. Once the water turns into steam, it no longer effectively cools the engine, leading to overheating and potential significant engine damage. On the other hand, the car radiator has a 50 percent antifreeze solution, which increases the boiling point of the water to 129 °C. This allows the water in the car radiator to better withstand and cool the engine during hot weather conditions without boiling and turning into steam. As a result, the car with the antifreeze would likely perform better and have a lower risk of engine damage in hot weather compared to the truck without antifreeze. Therefore, the truck would fare worse in hot weather and with a hot engine due to the lack of antifreeze in its radiator, increasing the chances of engine overheating and consequential damages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brazilian authorities estimate around 35,000 are marching in the capital. Troops are being deployed to defend government buildings and there is a heavy police presence on the streets. Protesters are demanding the resignation of President Michel Temer, fresh elections, and for economic reform plans to be withdrawn. Mr Temer has faced new corruption allegations in the last week, and is facing growing pressure to step down. According to reports, several ministries are being evacuated because of the protests - but not before the agriculture ministry was damaged. \\"There was an invasion of the ministry's private entrance. They lit a fire in a room, broke photos in a gallery of ex-ministers and confronted police,\\" a spokesman told the AFP news agency. There have been clashes between police and demonstrators and local media report one person has been injured and several have been detained. Planned demonstrations began peacefully around midday before clashes with police erupted. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at some demonstrators, and video footage showed other members of the crowd smashing windows or setting makeshift barriers afire. Last week, testimony released by the country's supreme court alleged that Mr Temer had taken millions of dollars in bribes since 2010. The plea-bargain testimony came from bosses of a giant meat-packing firm. In response, Mr Temer vowed to prove his innocence and remain as president while so doing. On Saturday, he filed a petition to have the investigation suspended, but reversed that decision on Tuesday. Mr Temer took office a year ago after his predecessor, President Dilma Rousseff, was impeached.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem.

She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me?

Like others, I have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the Clutter Killings, including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho-mythology of the participants to the crime -- including Capote himself. As to Capote, I cannot forgive him for willfully withholding Perry Smith's confessions, intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels. I believe truths and facts Capote \\"reserved\\" for his \\"book,\\" which required for Capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment, would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for Perry Smith even under the old McNaughton Rule. Capote himself could never write another major literary work after \\"In Cold Blood.\\" Shame and guilt. In my opinion, he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book/drama. To him, both men HAD to die for his book to succeed. The book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment. His actions and silence assured that ice-cold conclusion. Capote's book is not truth. It is not factual or journalistic. It is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination. What most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of Capote's mind, which may have been the most cold-blooded aspect of all. No wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer Blake's performance. That actor IS the nightmare from Capote's dishonest imaginings. So who is to say how the two killers should be played? Who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to \\"do it now\\" killing? I agree with the few who see in Eric Roberts' work a magnificent performance, Shakespearean in its range, yet played with heartbreaking sincerity. Anthony Edwards takes a much safer \\"attitude mode\\" to create a smarmy Hickok; but he is one-dimensional and boring, with only a few notes in his television range. Roberts is almost four-dimensional, adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body, a Frankenstein Creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what NOT to do. Like Leopold apropos Loeb, Robert's Perry Smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man. Without Hickok or a man of his particularities, Perry Smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors. He fears himself more than he fears anything else in life. Given the freedom from Capote's death grip on the consciousness of the Clutter killings, Roberts and Edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama. Same facts, some of the same lines from the case record, but deeper, more complex, with clearly titanic psychotic stresses -- indeed Roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is. What many of our reviewers dislike about this film, Roberts in particular, is that cold-blooded killing isn't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand. That is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic \\"interpretation of life and death\\" than Capote could ever create -- a real Tragedy. The actual cold-blooded killer, Mr. Capote, and his hypocritically artistic \\"non-fiction novel\\" do not control these interpretations and performances. If \\"In Cold Blood\\" and Capote's effect on life, literature and truth matters as much as scholars say, then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth, or a version of the truth, that is not the rank, cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of Capote's own abyss. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thinks positively of the movie, as it praises the performances of the actors (particularly Eric Roberts) and appreciates the freedom from Capote's influence on the story.

I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Seeds can be ordered online or from gardening supply stores and nurseries. Popular varieties of watercress include English Watercress and Broad Leaf Cress. You can also start growing from mature watercress purchased at a supermarket or farmer’s market. Cut the ends, then soak the base of the stalks in water for a few days to encourage root growth and proceed to plant them in soil as you would from seed. Choose a large container or planter with drainage holes that is at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep. Add a layer of landscaper’s cloth at the bottom of the container to keep the potting mix from escaping when you water. Add pieces of broken pots or small pebbles to the bottom layer of the container to allow for good drainage. You can also use multiple small containers and place them in a larger drainage tray. Plastic containers are recommended over terra cotta ones, which can dry out too quickly for watercress. You need to water the plant often. It's soil should be wet at all times. You can put excess water in the tray or bucket to keep the plant wet. You can also place small pebbles in the drainage tray to allow water to flow freely into the growing container. Use a soilless mixture that drains well and contains peat moss and perlite or vermiculite. Leave approximately two inches (5 cm) of space to the top rim of the container and water the mix well. The ideal pH of the potting mix should be 6.5 and 7.5. Place the seeds 1/4 inch (.64 cm) deep in the potting mix, allowing three to four inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) between each seed. Soak the potting mix deeply enough so that water fills the drainage tray below roughly halfway full, but doesn’t rise higher than the growing container. Replace the water in the drainage tray with fresh water every two to three days. Make sure the tray never dies out. Check it daily to see if you need to add more water. To keep the soil thoroughly cover the surface with a thin, clear plastic sheet that has small holes poked in it, which will retain water and allow airflow. The sheet can be removed when the sprouts begin to appear above the soil. Mist the soil surface well with water in a spray bottle every other day. Position the watercress where it will receive roughly six hours of natural light each day, but try to avoid harsh, direct rays that can burn the young plants. You can keep the containers indoors or when the weather is regularly between 55˚F and 75˚F (13˚ and 24˚C) where you live, you can place the container outside during warmer months. Add a small amount of water-soluble, all-purpose gardening fertilizer to the water in the drainage tray at the package-recommended rate. Once the plants have grown roughly five to six inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) in height use kitchen or gardening scissors to trim the top four inches (10.1 cm) of the plant as needed. Avoid taking more than a third of any plant when cutting to allow the plants enough foliage to continue growing. Periodic harvesting helps encourage new growth. Rinse the watercress in cool water, dry it and use immediately or wrap it in bundles and store in the refrigerator for use with a few days. Summary:","completion":"To grow watercress, plant seeds in a large, well-draining container with damp soil, provide lots of light, and keep the soil wet at all times, while sometimes trimming the plants and adding fertilizer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unless you’re a sole proprietorship and linking your personal and business accounts (a risky move), you’ll need a business account. Once obtained, customers will be able to make checks out to your business and you can deposit them in the account. First, obtain a tax ID number. You’ll need a federal and a state tax ID number. The federal ID tax number is issued by the IRS. You can obtain one by filling out IRS Form SS-4 (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss4.pdf). The state tax ID number can be found by contacting your state treasury, revenue department, or tax office. Use the list at http://www.statelocalgov.net/50states-tax-authorities.cfm to locate the appropriate authority from which you can obtain a state tax ID number. The bank in which you open a business account will need to see your articles of incorporation, corporate seal, and/or licenses and official registrations which prove you are the proprietor of a business. A merchant account is a bank account which allows businesses to process credit card or debit card payments. Merchant accounts can only be established at merchant acquiring banks (also known as acquiring banks). These sorts of banks exist specifically to process credit or debit card payments for merchants. A merchant account is easier to get after you’ve been in business for a while. Merchant account banks like to see that you understand your business, the risks you face, and can prevent or reduce fraud (especially credit card fraud). A merchant service aggregator is a third-party service which provides the processing capabilities of a larger merchant account bank on a smaller scale. PayPal and Square are two of the largest merchant service aggregators. PayPal processes payments to and from bank accounts and credit cards for both individuals and businesses. The service makes it easy to process payments online. PayPal makes money by subtracting a percentage of each sale you make. Square, similarly, processes credit and debit card payments for shop owners digitally and in stores. Unlike PayPal, they provide a credit-card reading device which can transmit data from a point-of-sale credit card for processing. The device easily snaps into many smartphones or tablets. Visit https://squareup.com/compatibility to check compatibility with your device(s). Use market feedback to set prices. Look at similar items of clothing from competitors and mark your clothing with prices within the same range. Mark everything clearly online as well as in direct sales through physical stores. Do not make up prices on the spot, or you will appear unprofessional and unprepared. . There are a variety of online outlets through which you can easily sell the clothes you made. Ebay and Etsy are probably the most famous sites for purchasing clothing online through small producers. Ebay is an online auction house. You can offer your clothes at a minimum price, and allow people to compete with each other to obtain them. Whoever submits the highest bid for a given item at the end of a designated time period will get the clothes. Etsy is not an auction house, but rather functions as a distribution hub of custom-made goods of all kinds -- candles, magnets, art, scrapbooks, as well as clothing. Through Etsy you can distribute your clothes and reach new consumers easily. Other similar sites include madeitmyself.com, depop.com, and storeenvy.com. All allow you to sell (and buy) independent clothing and apparel. When you’re starting out, farmer’s markets and local festivals are a good way to go. If you want to get an official stall at the farmer’s market, you may need to inquire with the organization which hosts the market and pay a small fee. Other local places that might be willing to carry some of your stuff include local coffee shops and cafes, which often offer local products for sale. If even farmers markets entail too much formality for you, you can easily set up on a busy public street in many municipalities. Take your clothes and lay them out on a blanket or small foldable card table so passers-by can browse. Bring a chair, a good book, and a lockbox (to collect money and make change) and wait for business to roll in. You can even send out an email or social media blast in the form of “I’ll be selling skirts, shirts, and summer wear this Saturday at the corner of Third and Main. Be there!” Find a good time to sell your clothes. Weekends and evenings are usually your best bet. Carry promotional materials -- business cards, flyers, or catalogs -- everywhere you go. You never know who you’ll run into or when an opportunity to promote your clothing business will come up. Many local businesses, libraries, restaurants, and the like have community bulletin boards in their entryways. Ask to post a one-page flyer on these boards to increase local buzz about your clothes. If you have a quality color printer and a decent graphic design suite like Photoshop, designing your own flyers and promotional materials should be easy. If not, enlist help from a friend proficient in graphic design and run a bunch of copies off at your local print shop. Cultivate a social media presence. Use sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest to show off your designs and newly-made outfits. Get a proper website. There are lots of template sites like Tumblr and Squarespace which allow you to set up a professional website without knowing a thing about code. Alternately, you could enlist help from someone who is more familiar with web design to build you a website from scratch. As you become more proficient at what you do, take on apprentices and new employees so you can ramp up production. Enlist help from creative individuals with an eye for fashion to design new outfits and styles. Finally, as your business grows, you might want to consider opening a boutique of your own. Do not make the decision to transition to a proper storefront lightly. The associated costs -- rent, taxes, and utilities -- may make the effort more expensive than its worth. If you’re set on opening your own shop, take your time looking at potential spaces. Find one located in a high-traffic area that your target market can easily access.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

Answer : Peter Fonda Solution:","completion":"Question: Who directed the 1971 American western film \\"The Hired Hand\\"?"},{"prompt":"Given the question: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

A 24-year-old woman in a hospital bed fighting off flesh-eating bacteria has to be told repeatedly -- each time she wakes up -- what has happened, her parents told CNN on Monday. The medication Aimee Copeland is given leads her to forget each time she falls asleep. \\"It's scary to her,\\" said her mother, Donna Copeland. She asks where she is and \\"doesn't understand.\\" Yet Aimee Copeland -- who has lost a leg and part of her abdomen to the virulent bacteria and may lose more, including her fingers -- is keeping her spirits strong, her father said. Can I get this flesh-eating bacteria? \\"We really don't see the suffering side of it. We see the miraculous survival,\\" Andy Copeland said. \\"I think that's the story that's inspired us, that's the story that's inspired, I think, the nation at this point.\\" On Facebook, he wrote that doctors have used words like \\"astonishing,\\" \\"confounding\\" and \\"mind-boggling\\" to describe the young woman's recovery. The master's student in psychology at the University of West Georgia was out with friends on May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when she grabbed onto a homemade zip line. It snapped. The accident left her with a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, when the pain continued, a friend took her to an emergency room, where she was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and flown to Augusta for surgery. She had contracted the flesh-devouring Aeromonas hydrophila. The bacterium is \\"remarkably common in the water and in the environment,\\" according to Dr. Buddy Creech, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. \\"When it gets into those deeper tissues, it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition,\\" he said. \\"When it does that, those tissues die, and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control.\\" In most cases, people contract the bacteria by swallowing them, resulting in diarrhea.

Being open to conversation and other party guests will help you stay engaged and make the party seem a lot more bearable. Can we draw the following conclusion? Talk with other guests at the party to prevent boredom Possible answers: -- Yes -- It's impossible to say -- No","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that talking with other party guests can help prevent boredom. Engaging in conversations, finding common interests, or sharing stories can make the party more enjoyable and help pass the time. Here are some additional tips to survive a boring party: 1. Arrive with a positive attitude: Your mindset can greatly impact your enjoyment of the party. If you expect it to be boring, you might unintentionally make it so. Instead, try to be optimistic and look for opportunities to have fun. 2. Find like-minded people: Look for other guests who may also be feeling bored or out of place and strike up a conversation. You may discover common interests, making the party more enjoyable for both of you. 3. Take part in activities: If the party has games, entertainment, or other activities, make a point to participate. Getting involved could help take your mind off the boredom and give you something enjoyable to do. 4. Be a good listener: Even if the conversations aren't entirely to your taste, try to be a good listener. Stay engaged in the conversation, ask questions, and show genuine interest in what others have to say. This way, you will make a positive impression on others and might even learn something new. 5. Use humor: Light-hearted jokes or funny stories can be a great way to liven up a boring party. Just make sure your humor is appropriate for the atmosphere and won't offend any guests. 6. Connect with the host: Make an effort to have a conversation with the host, as they can often introduce you to other guests or suggest activities for you to enjoy. 7. Offer help: If you see an opportunity to lend a hand, take it. Helping out during the party not only occupies your time and mind but also gives you a sense of purpose and involvement. 8. Set a time limit: If you know that you can only handle a certain amount of time at the party, set a realistic limit for yourself. Having a departure time in mind can make you feel less trapped and more in control. 9. Take breaks: If you're feeling overwhelmed by the boredom, step outside or find a quiet spot to regroup and gather your thoughts. A quick break can help you reset your mindset and return to the party with renewed energy. 10. Remember that it's okay to leave: If you've exhausted all your options for making the party more enjoyable and still can't shake your boredom, remember that it's okay to politely excuse yourself and leave when the appropriate time arises. You can thank the host for the invitation and try to make the best of the situation while you're there, but ultimately, you need to prioritize your own mental well-being. By keeping these tips in mind along with engaging in conversations with other guests, you can actively combat boredom and potentially turn a dull party into a more enjoyable social experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of this world, entire society of microscopic creatures was living on this tiny speck. They carried on with their daily lives, oblivious to the enormous creatures that surrounded them in the forest. Horton, a kind and curious elephant, noticed the dust speck as it passed by. His keen senses caught a glimpse of the microscopic society, and he was fascinated by their existence. Knowing that they could be in danger if any of the forest animals were to unknowingly harm their speck, Horton took it upon himself to ensure their safety. He gave chase to the speck and caught it before it could drift further away. Carefully, he placed the speck atop a nearby clover, where the tiny creatures could continue to live and thrive without interruption. The society prospered on the speck, and the forest elephants grew interested. Several of the creatures visit Horton's clover, and soon the word about the microscopic society began to spread. In this society, JoJo, a young, wise individual, was the eldest and the next in line for the mayoral position. JoJo didn't want to be the next mayor, though. He enjoyed his life and didn't care for the responsibilities and pressures that came with the mayoral position. Despite numerous attempts from his family members and peers to force him to take on the role, JoJo never discussed the mayoral position and continued to live his life as he pleased. Back in the forest, not everyone was pleased with the presence of the tiny society on the speck. A mischievous kangaroo was jealous of the attention Horton received for taking care of the speck and its inhabitants. She wished to reclaim her standing among the forest animals and wasn't above causing chaos to achieve her goal. In a cunning plan to get rid of the speck and the tiny civilization living on it, the kangaroo enlisted the help of a menacing vulture named Vlad Vladikoff. Vlad was known for his ruthless nature and willingness to harm others for personal gain. He agreed to aid the kangaroo in her plan, eager to watch the forest animals' reactions as their beloved speck disappeared. With a wicked grin, Vlad swooped down from the sky and, using his sharp talons, snatched the clover with the speck from Horton's watchful eye. Horton, sensing the danger to the tiny society, cried out in despair. He knew he had to do something to save them, but wasn't sure how to reclaim the speck from the terrifying vulture. As the forest animals gathered around him, JoJo's spirit and undying love for his people filled his heart. While he may not have wanted to be their mayor, JoJo knew that he needed to step up and fight for his people in their time of need. With a newfound sense of purpose and urgency, JoJo rallied the inhabitants of the speck. Together, they fought against the vulture and the kangaroo, proving that even the smallest of creatures could stand tall against insurmountable odds. Horton, proud and in awe of JoJo's bravery, remained by their side throughout the ordeal, offering his help whenever possible. Through teamwork and perseverance, the forest animals managed to outsmart Vlad and the kangaroo, saving the speck and its society from destruction. In the end, JoJo reluctantly accepted the mayoral position, realizing that he could use his wisdom and leadership skills for the greater good of his people. The entire forest learned a valuable lesson about the power of unity and resilience, and they were forever grateful for Horton's kind heart and dedication to protect even the tiniest of civilizations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to make a simple ornament for your desk? pick from the following. + Take an empty coke bottle, collect some beach sand and stain the sand in a few different shades, yellow, green, blue and so on, then layer it in the bottle; + Take a full coke bottle, collect some beach sand and stain the sand in a few different shades, yellow, green, blue and so on, then mix it in the bottle;","completion":"I believe that the first option, \\"Take an empty coke bottle, collect some beach sand, and stain the sand in a few different shades – yellow, green, blue, and so on, then layer it in the bottle,\\" is the better solution for creating a simple ornament for your desk. There are several reasons for this choice, which I'll outline below: 1. Aesthetics: Layering the colored sand in distinct, visually appealing layers provides a more interesting and eye-catching ornament than simply mixing the sand together in a bottle. Layering allows you to create unique patterns and designs, which could be an excellent conversation starter or a focal point on your desk. Moreover, when visitors or colleagues see the neatly arranged layers, they are more likely to appreciate the effort and creativity behind the ornament. 2. Ease of creation: Working with an empty coke bottle makes it simpler to create the ornament in comparison to a full coke bottle. With an empty container, it's easier to control the pouring of the sand and avoid accidentally combining the colors unintentionally. The empty bottle also offers better access to its interior for inserting a funnel or spoon to help create the desired layered effect. 3. No interaction with liquid: Mixing the colored sand with the coke liquid in a full bottle could potentially ruin the effectiveness of the ornament. The liquid may cause colors to blend or dilute, diminishing the vibrancy of the colored sand. Furthermore, the sand particles might clump together in an unappealing manner due to the viscosity of the liquid, reducing the visual impact of the ornament. 4. Preservation: Layered sand in an empty coke bottle can be preserved much more effectively as a permanent keepsake. In contrast, mixing the sand with coke may lead to microbial growth, impart an unpleasant odor, or degrade the structural integrity of the bottle over time. This could diminish the overall appeal of the ornament and may even require disposal of the creation eventually. 5. Customizability: With an empty coke bottle and colored sand, you can easily update the ornament to match seasonal changes, office themes, or personal preferences. This flexible modification is significantly more challenging with a full coke bottle. Simple adjustments might include adding small shells, tiny toy figures, or glass beads that elevate the ornament's appearance. In conclusion, creating a simple ornament for your desk using an empty coke bottle and layered, colored sand provides an aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-make, and customizable decoration that can be preserved indefinitely.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What did Bernard's band rename itself in 1978? , can you please find it? On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August...

This should help DHL, a division of the German postal service, reach its target of improving the company's carbon efficiency by 30 percent before 2020. \\"As the world's biggest logistics provider, we recognize a special responsibility to reduce the impact on the environment as much as possible,\\" said Frank Appel, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Post DHL, in a statement referring to a variety of measures being considered.

Dimensions of consciousness: Imagine you have a box of crayons and each crayon has a different color of consciousness. Each color represents a different level or \\"dimension\\" of consciousness.

What dimension is consciousness a part of? This question is a bit different from the first one. Everything around us, like toys and people, exists in space and time, which has three dimensions (like up-down, left-right, and forward-backward) and one time dimension (future or past). Consciousness is not a part of those dimensions. Rather, consciousness is how your brain or mind experiences and understands things around you. It's like tasting an ice cream or feeling happy; it's not about where you are in space, but how you experience it. So, these two questions are different. The first one asks about different levels of consciousness, like colors in a crayon box.

Front yard: A front yard can have apple trees if someone decides to plant them on their property. People often choose to plant fruit trees, including apple trees, in residential areas for gardening and fruit harvesting purposes. 2. Washington State: Washington State is well-known for its fruit production, including apples. In fact, Washington is the leading U.S. state in apple production, accounting for approximately 60-70% of the nation's entire apple production. 3. Countryside: Apple trees are often found in the countryside, where there is larger land for agricultural purposes. You'll commonly see apple orchards in rural areas, making the countryside a suitable environment for apple trees. 4. Concrete jungle: A \\"concrete jungle\\" refers to a highly urban area with a dense concentration of human-made buildings and infrastructure. These areas generally contain minimal green spaces and are not suitable for growing apple trees primarily due to the lack of open land and soil. Hence, the concrete jungle is not known for apple trees. 5. Wisconsin: While Wisconsin may not be as famous as Washington State for apple production, the state does have a sizable apple industry. Wisconsin's climate is suitable for growing apples, and the state has numerous apple orchards scattered throughout. In conclusion, the correct choice is the \\"concrete jungle\\" as it is an urban environment with little to no green spaces, making it unsuitable for apple tree growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" Question: \\"What natural disasters does Malaysia not have?\\" Answer: \\"It does not have hurricanes\\" Is this answer correct?

Barack Obama's historic peace-deal with Cuba after 50 years of cold war hostility was a breakthrough not to be sniffed at. But that didn't stop the US president having a try, when he got close and personal to a Cuban on Wednesday ... not a citizen, but a cigar. Significantly, it was the first time in 52 years that a US president has officially savoured the Cuban delicacy since John F. Kennedy stockpiled a secret stash of his favourite Havanas in the hours before he imposed a trade embargo on the Communist state in 1962. This, of course, doesn't include Bill Clinton's adventures with cigars and Monica Lewisnky in the Oval Office. Scroll down for video. Close to a Cuban: Obama was attending one of two White House receptions to welcome the start of Hanukkah when a guest handed him a large cheroot, which he took in his hand and ran under his nose. Obama was attending one of two White House receptions to welcome the start of Hanukkah when a guest handed him a large stogie. He took it in his hand and waved it in the air before running it under his nose for a whiff. The room fell near-silent as he paused to take in its aroma, before declaring it 'pretty good' to everyone's relief. 'I had the unique distinction of gifting the President of the United States with one of Cuba's finest cigars, a Montecristo Series at the White House…after a ceremony in which a Menorah was lit,' John Berzner, who offered the cigar to the president on Wednesday, told ABC News. He had packed just one cigar for the event, but felt compelled to present it to Barack Obama in celebration of the deal to begin normalising relations between the United States and Cuba, after 18 months of secret talks over prisoner releases brought a sudden end to decades of tension. 'Pretty good': The room fell near-silent as he paused to take in its aroma, before declaring it 'pretty good' to everyone's relief. When Berzner handed the cigar to Obama, he said: 'Mr. President, a Cuban cigar for you!' 'Oh, nice!' Obama replied as he lifted the cigar to his nose. 'The finest,' Berzner replied. The president approved, telling Berzner, 'Pretty good!' Nigel Savage, who was also a guest at the event and shot the video, added, 'The president definitely looked like he appreciated a good Cuban cigar.' It is unclear whether Obama kept the gift or handed it to the Secret Service. Legal again: President Barack Obama lifted some of America's sanctions against Cuba on Wednesday, making it legal for Americans who travel there to bring back a limited supply of cigars. The president's smoking habits have long been in the news. Obama last year told a United Nations official that he hadn't smoked a cigarette in years — mostly because of First Lady Michelle Obama. 'I haven't had a cigarette in probably six years,' Obama was overhead telling Maina Kiai at the U.N. General Assembly in New York back in September 2013. 'That's because I'm scared of my wife.' In 2009, the president said he was a 'former smoker' but he would 'constantly struggle' with kicking the habit. 'Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes,' he confessed at a press conference in 2009. 'Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No. 'I don't do it in front of my kids, I don't do it in front of my family,' he added. 'And, you know, I would say that I am 95 percent cured. But there are times where...There are times where I mess up.' Michelle Obama in February 2011 said her husband stopped smoking about a year earlier. President John F. Kennedy was partial to a puff and even asked his press secretary to buy him 1,000 of his favorite Cuban cigars in the hours before he imposed the Cuban trade embargo. Obama is not the first US president to enjoy a Cuban cigar on occasion. It emerged this week that President John F. Kennedy ordered his press secretary on February 2, 1962 to buy him as many of his favorite Cuban cigars as he could lay his hands on – and held off signing the Cuban trade embargo until his precious stogies were safely inside the White House. Kennedy asked Pierre Salinger to find at least 1,000 H.Upmann petit coronas, and gave him just a half-day to accomplish the task before they would become contraband. The next morning, Salinger recalled in rare video footage of his storytelling, he reported that he had bought up 1,200 of Cuba's finest exports – a feat the president pronounced 'Fantastic!' just before he signed a decree that banned all the communist country's products from the U.S. Washington already had some limited sanctions in place, but Kennedy's decision was the beginning of a comprehensive ban on U.S. trade with the island that remained intact until Wednesday. In 1996 the Helms-Burton law tightened the sanctions further. But President Barack Obama made a shocking move on Wednesday to reopen relations with Cuba and establish an embassy there. That means Americans who travel to Havana – and there will be thousands – 'will be able to return to the U.S. with some Cuban products, including Cohibas and other Cuban cigars,' according to Cigar Aficionado magazine.

It was a rare collaboration between the two that led to an entertaining and insightful conversation. However, the real highlight of the evening came when both golfers participated in the 'Ice Bucket Challenge' – a viral social media activity that raised awareness and funds for motor neurone disease research. The duo then passed on the challenge to soccer star Wayne Rooney, actress Meghan Markle, and former President George W. Bush. The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon As always, when worlds collide, sparks fly. Such was the case when Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy joined Jimmy Fallon on the popular late-night talk show. The pair shared their passion for the sport, insights into their competitive characters, and how they motivate themselves on the course. Both golfers are admired for their exceptional talent and their dedication to the sport, making their presence on The Tonight Show a treat to golf enthusiasts and casual observers alike. The Ice Bucket Challenge Craze However, golf was not the only thing on the agenda. At the end of the show, Fallon challenged the two golfers to complete the 'Ice Bucket Challenge.' The viral activity involves participants pouring a bucket of ice-cold water over their heads while filming the process. The challenge initially became a sensation in 2014 when it encouraged people to nominate friends and family to do the same within 24 hours or donate to the ALS Association, which supports research and awareness for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease. Raising Awareness for Motor Neurone Disease Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurological condition that attacks the nerve cells responsible for controlling muscle movement. This leads to the gradual weakening and wasting of muscles, causing difficulty in speaking, swallowing, and even breathing. The Ice Bucket Challenge aimed to create awareness and raise funds for MND research, support for those affected, and spotlight on the continued need for a breakthrough in treatment and a cure. A Chilling Experience As the audience anxiously anticipated, Woods and McIlroy showed their willingness to contribute to the cause by taking on the arduous task. After exchanging a few laughs, both golfers braced themselves and proceeded to pour buckets of ice-cold water over each other's heads. A combination of shock, laughter, and camaraderie filled the stage as Fallon and the audience cheered them on. Nominating the Next Challengers In traditional Ice Bucket Challenge fashion, it was now time for Woods and McIlroy to nominate the next three people to complete the activity or donate to the ALS Association. With great enthusiasm, the two picked soccer superstar Wayne Rooney, former Suits actress Meghan Markle, and the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. Given their prominent status and significant influence, these nominations promised to keep the challenge trending and ultimately increase awareness and support for motor neurone disease. Conclusion The memorable appearance of Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon once again exhibited the impact that celebrities and sports icons can have in raising awareness for crucial medical causes. By participating in the Ice Bucket Challenge and subsequently nominating other prominent figures, the two golfers successfully contributed to shining a light on the efforts to combat motor neurone disease, all while entertaining millions of viewers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick your answer from: A). keep their food and water separate from each other.; B). pour the water on top of the cat's food to save time.;...I think the answer is","completion":"A). keep their food and water separate from each other. To help encourage your cat to stay hydrated, the most reasonable method from the given options is to keep their food and water separate from each other. This separation allows the cat to consume water more frequently without being discouraged by the presence of food. Cats are known to have a low thirst drive compared to other animals, so it is crucial to create an environment that promotes hydration. Mixing water with their food, as suggested in option B, is generally not recommended as it could make the food soggy and less appetizing for the cat. This approach might also discourage them from drinking water separately, further compromising their hydration. Moreover, cats are sensitive to the placement of their food and water sources. Having distinct locations for both can contribute to their overall comfort, fulfillment, and well-being. It is essential to place both the food and water sources in a quiet and easily accessible area, free from any possible disturbances. In addition to separating food and water sources, there are other measures you can implement to encourage your cat to drink more water: 1. Offer fresh, clean water daily: Cats are more likely to drink water if it is clean and fresh. Make a habit of changing the water in the bowl daily. 2. Provide multiple water sources: There could be times when your cat feels stressed or uncomfortable, having multiple water sources in different locations can help ensure that they have access to water at all times. 3. Choose a suitable water bowl: Some cats prefer a shallow and wide water dish, while others may prefer drinking from a water fountain. Experiment with different options to find the one that works best for your cat. 4. Encourage water intake through diet: Feeding your cat wet food will help provide additional moisture, aiding in keeping them hydrated. 5. Keep bowls clean: Regularly clean the water and food bowls to prevent bacterial build-up and maintain a hygienic area. By following these recommendations, not only will you achieve option A's goal of separating food and water sources, but also create a comprehensive strategy for keeping your cat well-hydrated and healthy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \\"\\"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\\"\\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]> This “Confessions of a Republican” ad from the 1964 presidential election is going viral, thanks to its uncanny relevance to the 2016 presidential election. Posted by Quartz on Tuesday, March 8, 2016 The speaker (actor Bill Bogert) discussed his lifelong identity as a loyal Republican voter before expressing reservations about the candidacy of then-Senator Barry Goldwater, who unsuccessfully challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Among the concerns he aired (the ad’s full text is at the bottom of the page) were what he described as a tendency of Goldwater to rapidly reverse position or deny statements on key issues, as well as a hawkish attitude during a point in American history when the specter of nuclear destruction loomed: The hardest thing for me about this whole campaign is to sort out one Goldwater statement from another. A reporter will go to Senator Goldwater and he’ll say, “Senator, on such and such a day, you said, and I quote, ‘blah blah blah’ whatever it is, end quote.” And then Goldwater says, “Well, I wouldn’t put it that way.” I can’t follow that. Was he serious when he did put it that way? Is he serious when he says I wouldn’t put it that way? I just don’t get it. A President ought to mean what he says. President Johnson, Johnson at least is talking about facts … but Goldwater, often, I can’t figure out just what Goldwater means by the things he says. I read now where he says, “A craven fear of death is sweeping across America. What is that supposed to mean? If he means that people don’t want to fight a nuclear war, he’s right. I don’t. When I read some of these things that Goldwater says about total victory, I get a little worried, you know? I wish I was as sure that Goldwater is as against war as I am that he’s against some of these other things. I wish I could believe that he has the imagination to be able to just shut his eyes and picture what this country would look like after a nuclear war. That portion alone drew comparisons to a fluctuating GOP identity in 2016, as well as objections raised about Donald Trump within the Republican party. Another excerpt paralleled former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke’s endorsement of Trump in February 2016: I wouldn’t have worried so much about party unity because if you unite behind a man you don’t believe in, it’s a lie. I tell you, those people who got control of that convention: Who are they? I mean, when the head of the Ku Klux Klan, when all these weird groups come out in favor of the candidate of my party — either they’re not Republicans or I’m not. Bogert concluded by saying that he planned to vote against Goldwater on Election Day, and that his party made a mistake in its choice of nominee. A voiceover then urged viewers to vote for Johnson. While it’s true many of the expressed sentiments echoed 2016 election rhetoric, the video was not a modern creation. The first appearance of it we found on the internet dated back to at least 2008 (clicking “transcript” revealed identical text to the video that circulated in 2016). The source for the earlier version was the Museum of the Moving Image, which exhaustively catalogued such media as part of an exhibit called The Living Room Candidate: Presidential Campaign Commercials 1952-2012: The Living Room Candidate: Presidential Campaign Commercials 1952-2012 is an online exhibition presenting more than 300 television commercials from every election year since 1952, when the first campaign TV ads aired. The website will be updated through the 2012 election between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. The site includes a searchable database and features commentary, historical background, election results, and navigation organized by year, type of ad, and issue. There is a playlist feature that allows visitors to select, annotate, and share their own groups of ads, and to view playlists by guest contributors. Each selected commercial is accompanied by a list of related ads. There is a transcript for each ad and a feature that allows visitors to search the entire database by title and by words in the transcripts. Remarks on the clip provided further context about the political climate in 1964: The margin of Johnson’s landslide victory in 1964 was partly a repudiation of Barry Goldwater’s extreme right-wing views. Goldwater, an Arizona senator and author of the best-selling book The Conscience of a Conservative, won the Republican nomination after a bitter primary campaign against moderate New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. In his acceptance speech, Goldwater made the infamous statement, “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.” The assertion, meant as a defense of conservatism, merged in the public consciousness with statements in which Goldwater advocated the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Vietnam and argued that Social Security be made voluntary. Film professor and author of the linked book (What’s Fair on the Air: Cold War Right-Wing Broadcasting and the Public Interest) Heather Hendershot said in a 2011 Curator’s Note: The right-wing media explosion of the 1960s has largely been lost to history, but we do have some snapshots of liberal responses to Cold War right-wingers in the form of campaign ads produced for the 1964 Johnson presidential campaign. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) used TV and radio to emphasize that Republican nominee Sen. Barry Goldwater was a nut with his finger on the proverbial button—as in LBJ’s infamous “Daisy Ad.” “Confessions of a Republican” is certainly less well-known, and is undoubtedly one of the strangest political campaign ads ever produced. In it, an actor (not identified as such) expresses his extreme anxieties about Goldwater. As he becomes increasingly nervous, he lights a cigarette to steady his nerves, and the camera moves in closer and closer. Who the hell is this sweaty, perturbed Man in a gray flannel suit? The spot is long on emotion and short on in-depth information, a tactic that should be familiar to TV viewers who have experienced virtually any mass mediated political campaign. Content-wise, what is of greatest interest is our putative Republican’s concerns about the “weird groups” supporting Goldwater, like the Ku Klux Klan. During the 1964 campaign a strange waltz materialized around the idea of “extremism,” with Goldwater insistent that he was not an extremist and the Johnson campaign insistent that he was. Our confessing Republican, a fantasy created by the DNC, distanced himself from the kooks, while revealing himself to be on the edge of instability himself. A 2010 blog post delved into the ad’s historical relevance (describing Goldwater’s campaign as “a naked appeal to Southern white racists to bolt the Democratic Party and support the Republican Party”). The article was written as race and racism once again became enormous issues in American politics following the 2008 election of the United States’ first black president. In November 2014, the actor from the 1964 commercial was interviewed about the “Confessions of a Republican” ad: Mr. Bogert himself was a 28 year-old Republican just as fearful of the man his Party put forth to lead the nation as was his semi-fictional character. “No, I certainly did not vote for Barry Goldwater. I voted for Lyndon Johnson. Ask me how long it’s been since I voted for a Republican.” I did. It’s been a long time. The interviewer noted that they had presumed that the actor in the Johnson campaign clip was a Democrat, but Bogert said that its producers required an actual Republican star in the spot: But just as the agency behind this commercial (Doyle Dane Bernbach) made sure that all of the staff who made this campaign were ardent Democrats, I’d always presumed that the actor in the “Confessions of a Republican” commercial was also a Democrat. Why would a Republican actor sign on to do a commercial at the expense of his own Party? “No, I’m a Republican. I just couldn’t stand Barry Goldwater. I was terrified of him … My father was disappointed that I did this commercial. He thought my performance was good, but he disagreed with the entire thesis.” I learned that when Bill Bogert interviewed to get the gig, the first question that the ad agency asked the young actor was whether or not he was a Republican. It was a pre-requisite for the gig. Not only was the “Confessions of a Republican” ad a legitimate archival clip from the 1964 campaign, but the actor depicted in it was himself a Republican, a casting prerequisite. The clip was likely scripted, but it was not a 2016 creation intended as a critique of the current political discourse. [TEXT: Confessions of a Republican] REPUBLICAN: I don’t know just why they wanted to call this a confession; I certainly don’t feel guilty about being a Republican. I’ve always been a Republican. My father is, his father was, the whole family is a Republican family. I voted for Dwight Eisenhower the first time I ever voted; I voted for Nixon the last time. But when we come to Senator Goldwater, now it seems to me we’re up against a very different kind of a man. This man scares me. Now maybe I’m wrong. A friend of mine just said to me, “Listen, just because a man sounds a little irresponsible during a campaign doesn’t mean he’s going to act irresponsibly.” You know that theory, that the White House makes the man. I don’t buy that. You know what I think makes a President – I mean, aside from his judgement, his experience – are the men behind him, his advisors, the cabinet. And so many men with strange ideas are working for Goldwater. You hear a lot about what these guys are against – they seem to be against just about everything – but what are they for? The hardest thing for me about this whole campaign is to sort out one Goldwater statement from another. A reporter will go to Senator Goldwater and he’ll say, “Senator, on such and such a day, you said, and I quote, ‘blah blah blah’ whatever it is, end quote.” And then Goldwater says, “Well, I wouldn’t put it that way.” I can’t follow that. Was he serious when he did put it that way? Is he serious when he says I wouldn’t put it that way? I just don’t get it. A President ought to mean what he says. President Johnson, Johnson at least is talking about facts. He says, “Look, we’ve got the tax cut bill and because of that you get to carry home X number of dollars more every payday. We’ve got the nuclear test ban and because of that there is X percent less radioactivity in the food.” But, but Goldwater, often, I can’t figure out just what Goldwater means by the things he says. I read now where he says, “A craven fear of death is sweeping across America. What is that supposed to mean? If he means that people don’t want to fight a nuclear war, he’s right. I don’t.

I wouldn’t have worried so much about party unity because if you unite behind a man you don’t believe in, it’s a lie. I tell you, those people who got control of that convention: Who are they? I mean, when the head of the Ku Klux Klan, when all these weird groups come out in favor of the candidate of my party — either they’re not Republicans or I’m not. I’ve thought about just not voting at this election, just staying home — but you can’t do that, that’s saying you don’t care who wins, and I do care.

Please answer the following question: This article: Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

This wetness is only temporary, as your skin will soon begin to dry once you step out of the bath and remove the excess water, either by toweling off or simply air drying. Wet skin is a common side effect that most people experience after taking a bath but does not typically cause any discomfort or harm. The other options provided do not align with common sense as a general side effect of having a bath: - Use of water: While it is true that taking a bath requires the use of water, it is not a side effect. Rather, it is an essential element of the activity itself. - Drowning: Drowning is a severe and uncommon occurrence during a bath and is not considered a common side effect. It is critical to always practice safety measures while bathing and ensure that children and elderly individuals are closely monitored when in the water. - Rash: While some individuals may occasionally experience a rash after a bath, this is not a common side effect for most people and may be due to specific circumstances, such as allergies to bath products or water contaminants. - Dry skin: Although some individuals may experience dry skin after taking a bath, especially if the water is too hot or they use harsh soaps, this is not a typical side effect experienced immediately after bathing. Wet skin is the more common side effect in this scenario, while dry skin may become noticeable after the skin has fully dried. Proper moisturization and skincare can help address this issue."},{"prompt":"Q: You are given a sentence in Polish. Your job is to translate the Polish sentence into Italian.

West Bromwich Albion fans were treated to almost half-an-hour of club coverage on Sky Sports News this afternoon, while fans of other clubs wondered what on earth was wrong with their television. It was probably the most coverage the club has had in years, but even the most hardened of Baggies’ fans will have grown tired of the Tony Pulis video feature as it was played on loop for what seemed an eternity. Many Twitter users wondered what was going on down at Sky Sports HQ and why they were being subjected to so much Pulis time, but it soon became apparent when the cameras started rolling live again, almost 30 minutes later.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Speaking and listening is an important part of not only language arts classes, but also other content area classes. However, opening up discussions to be more than the typical call-and-response method (teacher asks a question, one student responds) is important to practice particularly in language arts class. The best advice on guiding facilitation is to ask open-ended questions to which the asker doesn’t necessarily know the answer Students should be encouraged to talk to each other, to know that there is not one particular correct answer, and to use text-based evidence when making statements about literature. It should be made clear to students that the purpose of class discussions is not to find out that they have all the right answers, but to explore the themes and aspects of the literature together. As a guiding facilitator, your job is to present students not only with basic comprehension questions, but also with complex, higher-order thinking questions that get them involved in the text. This can be done even in the early grades after reading a book. Questions beginning with, “Why does the author believe that ___?” and “What have you encountered that makes you think about ___?” are some starter recommendations. Keep discussions going. Ask students to build on what someone else said, or prompt them by saying “Tell me more about that.” Ask students to consider different perspectives on their statements, convince the class they are right, make predictions about what could happen next in the story, compare how their thoughts are the same or different from others, and summarize what they’ve learned from the discussion. Avoid trick questions, sarcasm, questions with obvious answers, yes-or-no questions, asking multiple questions before allowing time for response, and inadequate wait time (3-5 seconds) before changing the question or asking it again. Younger students will need some guidance on respectful discussion. Have the class make the rules together, using examples like “Stay respectful,” “Listen to others’ opinions,” “Look at who is speaking,” and “Piggyback off others’ ideas.” Post the rules in a visible place in the room and remind students of the rules before starting a discussion.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose from: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"(1). No While both questions are related to the concept of dyeing hair with Kool-Aid, they are not exact paraphrases of each other. The first question asks for a detailed explanation of the steps to dye brown hair with Kool Aid. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve that: 1. Choose the right Kool-Aid flavor: Select a Kool-Aid flavor or color that you want to dye your hair. Keep in mind that the color might not turn out exactly as you expect, especially if your hair is brown. Brighter colors may show up less vibrant on darker hair. 2. Prepare your hair: Make sure your hair is clean and dry before starting the process. The Kool-Aid will adhere better to hair that is free of oils and other products. 3. Mix the Kool-Aid dye: In a bowl, mix a few packets of Kool-Aid powder (unsweetened) with a little bit of water to create a thick paste. The amount of Kool-Aid you use may vary depending on the length and thickness of your hair. You can also add a teaspoon of conditioner to help the color spread more easily. 4. Apply the Kool-Aid dye: Put on gloves to protect your hands from the dye. Using a brush or your fingers, apply the Kool-Aid mixture to the sections of hair you want to dye. Be generous and make sure the hair is fully saturated with the mixture. 5. Wrap your hair: After applying the Kool-Aid to your hair, wrap those sections in aluminum foil or plastic wrap to prevent the dye from transferring to other parts of your hair or clothes. 6. Wait: Let the mixture sit on your hair for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. The longer you leave it on, the more intense the color will be. 7. Rinse: Once the time has passed, carefully remove the foil or plastic wrap and rinse your hair with cold water. Avoid using shampoo during this rinse, as it may reduce the intensity of the color. 8. Dry and style: Dry your hair and style as desired. Keep in mind that the color may continue to develop over the next few days, and it may fade after several washes. Now to answer the second question, yes, it is possible to dye your hair using Kool-Aid. As explained in the step-by-step process above, you can achieve temporary hair dye results using Kool-Aid. The outcome may not be as vibrant or long-lasting as traditional hair dye, but it offers a cost-effective and fun way to experiment with different hair colors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose from: + Comforted by Skylar; + in Skylar's boobs; + Resentful for Skylar's actions; I heard that Skylar buried Jan's head in her bosoms because she was crying. And I was wondering How will Jan feel after this? Answer:","completion":"Jan might feel comforted after being embraced by Skylar in a compassionate and nurturing manner. The act of burying her head in Skylar's bosom might serve as an expression of support, safety and solace during an emotionally vulnerable moment. Many people, when faced with difficult situations or challenges in their lives, need a shoulder to lean on or someone they can trust and confide in. In times of emotional distress, physical contact may provide vital reassurance and help build a sense of security and relief from pain, anxiety, and other negative emotions. Such gestures are known to help release oxytocin, a hormone often referred to as the \\"love hormone\\" or \\"cuddle hormone,\\" which fosters a sense of social bonding and attachment. In this case, Skylar's comforting embrace with her bosoms might offer Jan a reprieve from her current struggles, allowing her to regain her composure, take comfort in the knowledge that someone cares for her, and find the strength to move forward. Depending on their relationship or personal understanding of each other's boundaries, Jan may interpret this action as Skylar's heartfelt attempt to provide the emotional support she needed. However, it is essential to consider that personal preferences, individual boundaries, and cultural expectations could play a significant role in how someone perceives such an act of comfort. Jan's feelings following Skylar's actions may vary depending on her background and her relationship with Skylar. If Jan feels like her boundaries were violated or if she considers Skylar's actions inappropriate, she might feel resentful and upset. In this case, it would be essential for Skylar to acknowledge Jan's feelings, apologize, and ensure to respect her boundaries in the future. In conclusion, Jan's emotional response to Skylar's consoling gesture may vary based on their relationship, her emotional state, preferences, and personal boundaries. If the embrace was received positively, Jan might feel comforted and emotionally supported, leading to a strengthened bond between them. On the other hand, if Jan deems the act inappropriate, she might feel resentment toward Skylar and express her discomfort. Communication and understanding each other's boundaries are crucial in ensuring that both parties navigate such emotionally charged situations effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(i) No (ii) Yes The answer is:","completion":"(ii) Yes"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Step 1: find the rows of medicine table. Step 2: find the number of rows in enzyme table whose enzyme's id not one of the results of step 1","completion":"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enzyme WHERE enzyme.id NOT IN (SELECT medicine.enzyme_id FROM medicine); I used the definition of the SQL subquery to get the enzymes' id from the medicine table first. Then, I count the number of rows in the enzyme table where the enzyme's id is not among those selected in the subquery. This accomplishes both steps in a single SQL statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

He is tied in place, and a man begins brushing him all over. he","completion":"continues to brush the collie with diligence and care, despite the dog's mild protests in the form of impulsive wriggling and the occasional whimper. The bristles of the grooming brush run gently through the collie's thick and lustrous coat of tricolor fur — mostly sable and white, with a hint of black running down the spine. With every stroke, loose fur and debris are expelled, leaving behind a slick and gleaming pelt that accentuates the dog's muscular physique. The man seems to have a very systematic approach to the task at hand. He begins from the dog's head and works his way down the body, ensuring every strand of the dog's long and silky fur is attended to. The dog's eyes occasionally meet the man's. Even though he isn’t enthusiastic about his current predicament, the collie's trusting, amber eyes reveal a deep bond between the two. It's clear from the dog's resigned acceptance that this isn't their first grooming session together. Once the brushing is done, the owner moves on to the collie's ears, gently folding them back to inspect and clean inside. He uses a soft, damp cloth to remove any dirt or wax buildup. This is followed by the trimming of the dog's nails, a process that requires some treats as bribery for the collie. While the collie might have been standing on top of the table reluctantly initially, there seems to be an understanding now. The grooming table has turned into an area for a bonding ritual between man and his faithful companion—an integral routine the collie ultimately seems to accept as another peculiar aspect of human love. After all, beauty routines can be both taxing and calming. And in a strange, convoluted way, coming to terms with a sense of cleanliness that animals aren't usually built to comprehend does form an unusual bonding experience. It is as if the man is trying to articulate care in a language that is initially alien to his little collie. But over time and with routine, they seem to have established an understanding. The process ends with a soft rub over a fluffy tail accompanied by a soft word of praise from the man. As if relieved, the collie bounds off the table once he is untied, shaking momentarily to re-align his coat before happily trotting off, tail wagging. The stunning coat of fur now looked glossier, healthier, and it undeniably added a certain charismatic flair to the collie's disposition. From all this, it's evident that this kind of bonding through the medium of care and hygiene is a language that man and beast comprehend, attesting to the age-old saying of the beautiful bond between a man and his dog."},{"prompt":"Q: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Il souligne très justement diverses difficultés affectant le pluralisme médiatique et la concentration de la propriété dans un certain nombre d'États membres. Which language is this?","completion":"The language used in the given text is French. The text discusses the challenges related to media pluralism and the concentration of ownership in several member states. Here's a detailed translation and explanation of the statement: The sentence \\"Il souligne très justement diverses difficultés affectant le pluralisme médiatique et la concentration de la propriété dans un certain nombre d'États membres\\" translates to \\"It quite rightly highlights various difficulties affecting media pluralism and the concentration of ownership in a certain number of member states.\\" In this context, the statement underlines the importance of ensuring that media outlets remain diverse and free to express a range of views. Additionally, it emphasizes that media ownership should not be concentrated in a few hands or confined within a small group of member states. The diverse media landscape contributes to a healthy democracy, allowing for a variety of opinions and perspectives to be heard and considered. Media pluralism is essential to guaranteeing unbiased news and opinions in society. Concentration of ownership becomes problematic as it restricts the range of voices and opinions being shared, which can lead to a one-sided and homogeneous point of view in the media landscape. The statement encourages finding solutions to overcome these difficulties, ensuring a more democratic and fair media environment in member states. In summary, the French statement raises valid concerns about the importance of maintaining media pluralism and the potential risks associated with concentration of media ownership among member states. Addressing these challenges can lead to a more balanced and diverse media landscape that fosters democratic values and upholds the right to freedom of expression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? To make a fan fold, you will need a pressed square napkin, a flat surface to work on, and either a glass or plate. You can either place the finished fan fold on a dinner plate, or in an empty glass. You can use either cloth or paper napkins, though cloth will look more elegant and refined. Cloth napkins are also reusable so you can continue to use them for other special occasions. The bigger the napkin, the larger your fan will be. Smooth the napkin out by hand so there aren’t any wrinkles. The napkin should now be a rectangle. Orient the open half where the two edges meet towards you. Starting on one end, take approximately two inches of fabric and fold it in towards the center. You will continue folding the napkin like an accordion, taking two inches of fabric and folding it towards the center of the napkin. Stop folding when you have approximately four inches of unfolded napkin left. Now, fold the napkin in half horizontally bringing the two bottom edges of the fan together. Your fan should now be folded in half with the extra four inches of unfolded napkin hanging on the inside fold of the fan. If the unfolded napkin is on the outside of the fan, unfold the fan and refold it the opposite way. Take the unfolded corners that are part of the four inches of unfolded napkin section. Tuck the top corners unfolded napkin section into where the two halves of the fan meet. This will make a triangular edge along the unfolded section. Make sure to tuck it securely to make a sturdy base. Let the napkin fan out into a semi-circle. The base that you’ve created from folding the unfolded corners of the napkin will act as a base to keep your napkin fan standing. Be aware that this fan is delicate. The fan may fall and unfold if you try to move the dinner plate that it is resting on. You can use the same basic technique of the standing fold to create a fan that can be placed inside of a glass. Rather than leaving four unfolded inches, fold the entire napkin like an accordion. Now that the napkin is fully folded, take one end of the fan and fold approximately one inch over. Allow the fan to open up. Place the folded end of the fan into your glass and spread the rest of the fan out.

Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.

There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson).

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.

He finds a greasy spoon called Pop's Eats, where Pop (Percy Kilbride) is worried about waitress Stella because she has not shown up for work for days. Ex-New York cop Mark Judd (Bickford) tells him not to worry. Sure enough, the sultry Stella (Darnell) soon returns.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where does Atticus's daughter live in Go Set a Watchman? Context: An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\". Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.

Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1863. Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.The series' impact on Dalí is evident in Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39, Grande hazaña! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande hazaña! Con muertos!. In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of The Disasters of War. They purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads.

Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. I am facing a new situation today: Pat has 2 acres of land next to Tim's property. Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. The soil on Pat's parcel has a good structure and high infiltration capacity. Pat gets twice as much food of his land every year. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which soil from these two parcels has a poor structure? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the given situation, the soil with a poor structure is the one on Tim's property. Tim's property has alkaline clay soil, which is characterized by having a high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure, and a low infiltration capacity. These unfavorable properties are mainly due to the presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell and become difficult to manage. To improve the soil and grow crops, Tim had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic. On the other hand, Pat's parcel has a soil with a good structure and high infiltration capacity, allowing Pat to obtain twice as much food from his land every year as compared to Tim."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's why: 1. Soccer: Soccer is a sport, not a place or venue, so while outdoor soccer fields often have bleachers, the term itself doesn't indicate a specific location that houses indoor bleachers. 2. Sporting event: A sporting event is a broad term that refers to any athletic competition, which could be held indoors or outdoors. While many sporting events may have bleachers, this answer choice doesn't point directly to an indoor location. 3. Pharmacy: A pharmacy is a store where people buy medications, over-the-counter drugs and other health and wellness products. Bleachers are not found in pharmacies since seating isn't a typical feature in these spaces. 4. Gymnasium: A gymnasium, or indoor gym, is a facility designed for sports, physical education, and other athletic activities. Gymnasiums often have bleachers, which are tiered rows of seats that provide a place for spectators to sit and watch the events taking place in the gym. These indoor venues can host a variety of sports, including basketball, volleyball, and indoor track. As such, gymnasiums are the most appropriate location among the options to find indoor bleachers. 5.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film is set in the 1750s and involves Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who enters the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a GuaranÃ­ community to Christianity.[6] The GuaranÃ­ community is not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, shown by the opening scene where they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls, a large waterfall they live above. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. The GuaranÃ­ warriors, captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza (Chuck Low). After returning from another kidnapping trip Mendoza is told by his assumed fiancÃ©, Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi), that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn). Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his actions. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return to the GuaranÃ­ village, scaling a cliff while dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. Upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, there are a few tense moments when the natives recognise him, but after seeing him in his humbled state, they cut away his heavy bundle and forgive him. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the GuaranÃ­. Moved by the GuaranÃ­'s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible.

The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party.

Ensure that your snail house is large enough. Replace the compost. Keep plenty of fresh water in the enclosure.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Optimizing Your Snail Farm: Creating a Semi-Intensive System for a Thriving Gastropod Population Introduction Snail farming, also known as heliciculture, is a lucrative agricultural venture with increasing demand for the supply of edible snails. Snails are not only consumed as a delicacy in various cuisines but are also valued for their nutritional content and are used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. To meet the escalating demand, it is essential to create an efficient snail farming system that ensures the optimal growth and health of the gastropods. One such system is the semi-intensive system that balances the benefits of both extensive and intensive methods. This article will explore how to determine whether you should create a semi-intensive system for your snail farm and provide insights on achieving optimal conditions for snail farming. Determining the Need for a Semi-Intensive System Before deciding on implementing a semi-intensive system, it is crucial to assess the specific needs of your snail farm. The semi-intensive system combines the natural habitat of snails with some form of artificial enclosure, providing a controlled environment that promotes growth and reproduction. Factors to consider include the number of snails you plan to raise, available resources, potential market demand, and your experience with snail farming. The semi-intensive system is most suitable for those planning to operate a small to medium-sized snail farm. It provides a balance between managing snail growth and managing costs, as this system does not require significant initial investment compared to the intensive method. Additionally, it ensures a more controlled environment when compared to the extensive system, resulting in higher yields due to better protection from predators and enhanced ease of management. Ensuring Sufficient Space for Snail Growth and Health One of the primary factors to consider in a semi-intensive system is the size of your snail house, also known as a snailery. An adequately sized snailery allows the snails to grow and thrive while minimizing stress and overcrowding. To calculate the appropriate size for your snailery, consider the species of snail you intend to farm and their anticipated growth rate, as well as the number of snails you plan to raise. Snails are sensitive to changes in their environment, and providing ample space for movement and growth is crucial to their overall well-being. It is recommended to allocate approximately 10 square meters of space for every 500 mature snails. This size estimation accounts for the snails' activities, such as foraging, laying eggs, and mating, as well as the necessity of having a designated area to isolate sick or injured snails. Replacing Compost for Optimal Nutrition When setting up a semi-intensive snail farming system, it is important to use high-quality compost or soil substrate that is rich in essential minerals and nutrients. Maintaining a favorable soil substrate condition is vital for the snails' nutrition, growth, and reproduction. Therefore, it is necessary to replace the compost periodically to ensure that your snails continue to thrive and receive the nourishment they require. Depending on the snail species and the environmental conditions of your snailery, the compost may need to be replaced every 6 to 12 months. Regular monitoring of the soil substrate will allow you to determine when it is time to replace the compost based on the nutrient content of the soil. Maintaining Clean Water Sources Snails require access to a clean and fresh water source for their survival. In a semi-intensive system, it is essential to provide a regularly replenished water supply in the enclosure. Snails consume water for hydration, maintaining their body temperature, and regulating their metabolism. Dehydration is detrimental to snails, as it may cause them to become inactive and negatively impact their growth and reproduction. To provide a consistent source of clean water, install a continuous-flow drinking system in the snailery. This provides the snails with fresh water on a constant basis and prevents the water from being contaminated by waste. Additionally, keep the humidity levels within the snailery in check by regularly misting the enclosure and properly draining excess surface water to prevent the onset of harmful pathogens. Conclusion In conclusion, establishing a semi-intensive snail farm system requires careful consideration of your specific needs and goals while ensuring that the snails have the appropriate environment to grow and thrive. By implementing proper management techniques, such as maintaining a sufficiently large snailery, replacing compost to promote nutrition, and providing access to clean water sources, you can optimize your snail farming venture and foster a thriving gastropod population."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Density is also an important physical property of matter. The concept of density combines what we know about an objects mass and volume. Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena.

In a fire station in Toronto, a fire pole likely serves the same purpose. Regarding the first firefighters, the existence of firemen can be traced back to ancient civilizations, with the first organized firefighting force being established in Ancient Rome around 6 AD under the rule of Emperor Augustus. Known as the \\"Vigiles,\\" these fire brigades were responsible for controlling and extinguishing fires and saving lives in the great city. Firefighting techniques and equipment evolved over time, and professional fire departments emerged in various cities, such as the London Fire Brigade in England, established in 1666, and the New York City Fire Department in the United States, officially established in 1865.

The move to limit Airbnb hosts from renting properties for more than 90 days was announced in December. London boroughs have warned that short-term lets are pushing up longer term rental prices in the capital. But nearly a third of all boroughs told the BBC the time limit would not slow the growth of short-term letting. Airbnb, an accommodation listing website, said the impact of short-term lets and home-sharing websites on rental prices in London was \\"negligible\\". Last year, it commissioned the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) to investigate the impact of short-term lets on London's rental market . Airbnb said the IPPR report found \\"entire homes\\" booked on the site at least once a year made up less than 1% of total private housing stock in London in 2015. But the study also showed 11% (2,444 properties) of Airbnb's entire home rentals were let for more than six months of the year. The IPPR found landlords were, in some cases, removing properties from the long-term rental market altogether and offering their properties for rent on a series of short-term lets instead. In turn, this piled pressure on long-term rental prices due to a lack of available properties, the report said. It also found some Airbnb hosts may have been offering properties for rent illegally. Events organiser Daniel Thomas has been looking for an affordable room to rent in the area for over a year. Mr Thomas, who commutes from Slough to Ladbroke Grove, said: \\"Lots of young people here are looking for properties for the first time, and they're all just going to tourists, so we have nowhere to live.\\" The law states owners cannot let property for more than 90 days in a given year on a short-term let. If an owner wants to let for longer, they must seek planning permission for a \\"change of use\\" from their local council. Seven London boroughs - Camden, Hammersmith, Haringey, Islington, Lewisham, Waltham Forest, Westminster - have now called for tougher legislation to prevent illegal lettings. A Camden Council spokesman said: \\"There is a clear justification for doing so given the detrimental impact short-term letting is having on housing availability in London.\\" Diarmard Ward, executive member for housing at Islington Council said: \\"Airbnb and other short-term letting sites push up rents and they also reduce the number of homes for people who want to rent long term.\\" Airbnb's northern Europe boss, James McClure, told BBC London the company was introducing the 90-day limit \\"to forestall any potential danger down the road\\". \\"That's why we're looking to implement automatic limiting to ensure the law is respected and it's up to councils to decide the best use and mix of properties in their area,\\" he added. The Department for Communities and Local Government said any landlord breaching the 90-day limit \\"faces a hefty fine\\", and added it is up to local councils to enforce the law. A government spokesman praised Airbnb's policy and encouraged other services to follow suit. But commercial landlords operating on Airbnb told BBC London the 90-day limit would have no effect. One, who has three homes listed on the site but did not want to be named, said: \\"I'll just carry on as before. When the 90 day rule comes up, I'll re-register the homes I have so it looks like they're different homes... a few metres away. \\"I know many other landlords planning to do the same thing.\\" Another, Bulent Boytorun, who rents four homes on Airbnb, said he may move his business to alternative home-sharing platforms. All 33 of London's boroughs, including the City of London, were asked whether they believed all home-sharing websites should block illegal lets. Twelve of the 28 the councils that responded to BBC London said they supported it. But when BBC London asked other competitors in the short-term letting market sites if they enforced the 90-day rule or planned to do so, none said they did. A spokesperson for TripAdvisorRentals, which lists about 8,000 London properties, said: \\"To list on our site, homeowners and managers must agree to our terms and conditions, which require a property to be operated in accordance with all local laws and regulations.\\" This article was about:","completion":"This article discusses the impact of Airbnb and other short-term letting platforms on the London rental market.

Elections would be held on 26 October, he said in a TV address. Separately, Ukraine's military says it clashed with rebel armoured vehicles that entered the country from Russia. More than 2,000 people have died in months of fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The two regions declared independence from Kiev, following Russia's annexation of the southern Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in March. In the address late on Monday, Mr Poroshenko said he acted fully in accordance with the Ukrainian constitution, which states that new elections must be held if a ruling coalition in parliament is not formed within 30 days. The previous coalition collapsed on 24 July. The president stressed that the \\"current composition of the parliament has been the mainstay of (President) Yanukovych\\", who was forced to flee Ukraine amid mass street protests in February. \\"Elections is the best way of cleaning things up,\\" he said. However, new elections do hold some risks for Mr Poroshenko, the BBC's David Stern in Kiev reports. If the president is unable to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine before the October vote, he risks a voter backlash. Anger is also rising among Ukrainians at the government's inability to introduce reforms and tackle corruption, our correspondent adds. Earlier on Monday, Ukraine's military said a column of 10 tanks and two armoured personnel carriers had crossed from Russia and been heading towards the south-eastern port of Mariupol. It said Ukrainian troops destroyed two tanks, blocking the area. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had not heard the reports about the alleged incursion, but complained of regular \\"disinformation about our 'incursions'\\". Mr Lavrov also commented on the parading of captured Ukrainian government soldiers by rebels through the centre of Donetsk on Sunday. Crowds lined the streets chanting \\"fascists\\" as the dishevelled-looking prisoners walked by with their hands tied behind their backs. Some people threw eggs and other objects at the prisoners. The move was widely condemned around the world. However, Mr Lavrov said this was \\"nowhere near mistreatment\\" and that Ukrainian fighters' actions often amounted to \\"war crimes\\". \\"I saw images of that parade and I didn't see anything close to what could be considered as humiliating,\\" he said. On Monday, heavy fighting on Monday was also reported in and around Donetsk. Ukraine's security services said 10 Russian soldiers were captured in the region. Ukraine accuses Russia of arming the rebels in the east and sending its troops into the country - a charge the Kremlin denies. On Tuesday, Mr Poroshenko is expected to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at talks in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.

It can be found in drugstores or online and comes in spray and powder form. To apply, spray your hair a few times or sprinkle a little on top of your scalp. Comb in the spray or powder, which will help comb out any dandruff flakes. Rinse your comb after each stroke. Talcum powder can be used instead, but it can make dark or black hair look grey, white, or dotted. Find the region of your scalp with the most dandruff, and comb your hair so it covers this area.

Article: Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of\\" a new world\\".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a \\"Charlie horse\\" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum.

If There is no indication in section 717 or its legislative history that Congress intended to take such a narrow view of GAOas authority., can we conclude that \\"Section 717 showed that Congress had intended to take a narrow view of GAO's authority.\\"?","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is not reasonable to conclude that \\"Section 717 showed that Congress had intended to take a narrow view of GAO's authority.\\" Since there is no indication in Section 717 or its legislative history pointing towards a narrow interpretation of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) authority, the opposite conclusion should be drawn. To assess the intent behind a particular statutory provision like Section 717, it is important to examine the following elements: 1. Statutory language: The actual text of Section 717 should be analyzed to determine whether any narrow or broad interpretation of GAO's authority is apparent from the phrasing. The presence or absence of limiting language may provide valuable insights into Congress's intention. 2. Legislative history: Reviewing the records of congressional proceedings, committee reports, and other documents related to the drafting and enactment of Section 717 can help identify discussions or comments relating to the scope of GAO's authority. These resources might offer evidence of whether Congress intended a narrow or broad interpretation. 3. Purpose of the statute: Understanding the purpose of the statute or the problem that Congress intended to address with Section 717 can help in determining the scope of GAO's authority. If the purpose of the provision aligns with a broader interpretation of GAO's powers, it would not be correct to conclude that Congress intended a narrow view. 4. Judicial interpretation: Courts may have already interpreted Section 717 in cases where its scope was challenged or questioned. Examining these judicial interpretations could provide valuable insights into the intended scope of GAO's authority. 5. Consistency within the broader statutory scheme: Placing Section 717 in the context of the overall statutory structure may provide clues about the intended scope of GAO's authority. If Congress has generally assigned broader powers to the GAO in other related provisions, it would be inconsistent to assume that it intended a narrower view in Section 717. In conclusion, without any indication in Section 717 or its legislative history that Congress intended a narrow view of GAO's authority, it would be incorrect to assume such a restrictive interpretation. It is essential to consider the variety of factors mentioned above when determining the scope of GAO's authority and understanding Congressional intent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is Python primarily used for?","completion":"While these two questions may seem similar, they actually have slightly different implications. Let me provide a detailed explanation for each question to help illustrate the subtle difference between them. 1. What is Python used for currently? This question generally seeks to understand the various applications and areas where Python, as a programming language, is being employed in the present context. It aims to explore the current landscape of Python usage in various industries and fields. In this case, the emphasis is on the present scenario, without any regard for which applications might be more significant or dominating compared to others. Some current uses for Python include: - Web Development: Python is widely used in web development, with popular frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid, making it easy to develop and maintain professional websites and web applications. - Data Science: Python has established itself as a dominant language in the field of data sciences, thanks to its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, which are essential for data analysis and manipulation. - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Python also plays a significant role in machine learning and AI, with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras offering users powerful platforms for training and deploying models. - Automation: Python is a popular choice for automation tasks, as it is easy to learn, write, and understand, especially for repetitive tasks or simple scripting purposes. - Networking and Security: Within the realms of networking and security, Python’s flexibility and its extensive standard library make it an ideal language for network programming, penetration testing, and cybersecurity research. - Game Development: While not as common as some other languages, Python still has usage in game development, with libraries like Pygame providing developers with tools for building simple 2D games. 2. What is Python primarily used for? This question, on the other hand, aims to understand the main or most significant area of application for Python as a programming language. It assumes that Python's usage tends to be more prominent in specific fields compared to others, and focuses on identifying those dominant areas. To answer this question, we can consider the following primary use cases of Python: - Web Development: As previously mentioned, Python is very popular in web development, making it one of the primary uses for the language. - Data Science: Python's rich ecosystem of tools and libraries also make it the go-to programming language for data scientists, which can be considered another primary use case. - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Python's role in machine learning and AI is substantial, and as these fields continue to grow in importance, so does Python's position as the dominant language in these areas. It is important to note that Python's versatility means it still has relevant applications in many other fields; however, web development, data science, and machine learning/AI can be identified as the primary areas where Python usage is most significant and well-established. In conclusion, while both questions address Python's usage, the first question focuses on providing a broader and more comprehensive view of the areas in which Python is used currently, whereas the second question seeks to identify the primary or most significant use cases where Python excels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Because hie forgot something, he put the car in what? Possible A: straightforth, reverse, backwards, back and, race Why is \\"reverse\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Reverse\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in response to the question 'Gill went forth for some time. Because he forgot something, he put the car in what?' because it demonstrates an understanding of both human behavior and the workings of a car. Let's break this down further by considering each possible answer and why \\"reverse\\" is the most reasonable based on human common sense. 1. Straightforth: This term suggests moving forward or continuing in the same direction. However, in the context of the question, Gill needs to return to where he came from because he forgot something. Moving forward will take him farther away from his starting point, so this option is counterintuitive and doesn't align with human common sense. 2. Reverse: This answer is aligned with human common sense because it accurately represents the action Gill would need to perform to return to his starting point. In a car, \\"reverse\\" is the gear that allows the car to move backward. If Gill realized he forgot something and needed to go back, he would most logically put the car in reverse to achieve this. This action aligns with how humans understand cars and their functions. 3. Backwards: This term, while generally correct, is less specific compared to \\"reverse.\\" It does indicate that Gill needs to return or move in the opposite direction, but it does not explicitly mention the gear he would need to use to do so. Therefore, while this answer may convey the general idea, \\"reverse\\" is a more precise term and thus a more accurate representation of human common sense. 4. Back and: This option is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear understanding of the action Gill needs to take. It suggests going back, but it does not specify how Gill would do so. As a result, it does not align well with human common sense, which seeks clear and specific information to make a decision. 5. Race: This term implies moving quickly or speeding and has no clear connection to the context of the question. In the given scenario, Gill needs to go back because he forgot something, so racing or speeding would not be relevant or aligned with human common sense. In conclusion, the answer \\"reverse\\" aligns best with human common sense because it correctly interprets the context of the question and describes the necessary action Gill would need to take in response to realizing he forgot something. It demonstrates an understanding of human behavior in such a situation and provides an accurate representation of the workings of a car, making it the most reasonable and logical response."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries, though some were allowed to remain in the capital. Next, he moved to control the government. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage.

Title: Easy check (and fix) for leaks Product review: I love Avent products, and so does my baby. I was given an infant feeding set by a friend before my daughter was born, and when I choose to bottle feed when she was about a month old, the Avent system made the change so easy. I love how the system will grow with my baby.However, I did have some problems with leaks so I did a bit of testing to determine which part of the assembled bottle was faulty.I discovered that some of the teats still had little bits of silicon left at the base from the manufacturing process (I'm sure there's a name for that!) which was preventing them from sealing properly.Easily fixed - just run your finger around the inside and outside of the base of the teat, and if there are any bits of silicon sticking out, pull 'em off! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light. The step-by-step reasoning is as follows: 1. The user starts off the review with a positive statement, saying they love Avent products, and that their baby also seems to enjoy them. This creates an overall positive tone to the review. 2. The user mentions that they were given an infant feeding set by a friend and that it made the transition to bottle feeding smooth when their daughter was around a month old. This again casts the product in a good light due to its ease of use during a critical phase in a baby's life. 3. The user appreciates that the product can adapt or grow with the baby, indicating that it provides long-term value, which again is positive. 4. However, the user does mention a negative aspect, which is the leakage they experienced with the bottle. This could cast the product in an unflattering light. 5. Despite the leak issue, the user takes time to investigate the problem and finds out that it is caused by residual silicon left from the manufacturing process at the base of the teats. 6. The user gives a simple solution to this problem, which is to run a finger around the base of the teat and remove any silicon bits. Fixing this issue is straightforward and does not require any external materials, making the problem seem less serious.

Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Question: suppose there is less damange by acid rain happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the situation and consequences step by step. Step 1: If there is less damage caused by acid rain, this means that the waters are less acidic. Step 2: As a consequence, they absorb less aluminum from the soil. Step 3: The water that runs off into lakes, streams, etc., contains less aluminum, causing fewer harmful effects to the aquatic ecosystem. Step 4: Fewer fish and their eggs die, leading to a more stable fish population. Step 5: Fewer frogs and plants die, allowing for higher populations of these species. Step 6: Fewer insects and other wildlife die, maintaining a more balanced ecosystem. Step 7: With a more balanced ecosystem, the overall impact of acid rain is reduced, and the environment is more resilient against future damage. In light of these steps, it would make sense to choose \\"B: less\\" as the correct answer. With less damage caused by acid rain, the environment and ecosystems are healthier and more stable, making them less susceptible to more damage from acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Baltimore Children’s Bookstore wins grant from James Patterson The Children’s Bookstore in Baltimore is one of the first recipients of James Patterson’s grants. James Patterson — one of the most popular authors in the world — is taking a page from the book of Dolly Levi, who famously said, “Money, pardon the expression, is like manure. It’s not worth a thing unless it’s spread around, encouraging young things to grow.” Last year, the bestselling thriller writer announced plans to distribute grants to help independent bookstores, and this week the first checks went out to almost 60 stores around the country: more than 250,000 in amounts ranging from 2,000 to 15,000. Patterson has said he will give away 1 million before he’s done. One of those lucky stores is The Children’s Bookstore in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore. JoAnn Fruchtman, a former artist and teacher, has owned the small store for 35 years. She was stunned by the boldness and generosity of Patterson’s plan. “I’ve met a lot of authors,” she said, “and a lot of authors have supported indie bookstores, for sure, but this is really amazing.” She never formally applied for a grant. She just wrote Patterson a letter back in November “commending him for doing what he’s doing.” In her letter, Fruchtman also described the history of her store and its efforts to help Baltimore City public schools. For the past 15 years, she’s been raising money from the community so that teachers can apply for grants to pay for books to use in their classroom. “So, for example, if a high school class is doing a unit on World War II,” she explains, “they can get copies of ‘Night,’ by Elie Wiesel. And then the kids get to keep the books.” Through this program, The Children’s Bookstore has given away tens of thousands of books. Obviously, Patterson was impressed, though Fruchtman says she does not yet know the size of the grant her store has received. Fruchtman gives the credit to the people she works with. “My staff is fabulous,” she says. “They all read. They all love literature. They all love to recommend books. The success of the store has to do with the fact that we’re just totally devoted to our kids — and getting them excited about books. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Children's Bookstore in Baltimore has been named as one of the first recipients of a grant from renowned author James Patterson.

The Children's Bookstore, owned by JoAnn Fruchtman, has been in operation for 35 years and has been actively involved in helping Baltimore City public schools by providing books to classrooms through community-raised funds.

Question: You are presented with the question \\"Cancer cells perform what more often than regular cells?\\" and the following answer choices: - death - PDAs - grow - recovery - disease - kill them - mitosis - radiation Now knowing that cancer cells divide more often than normal cells, and grow out of control and basically, mitosis is the process by which a cell divides, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"The best answer would be \\"mitosis.\\" Mitosis refers to the process of cell division, where one cell splits into two identical cells; each carrying the same genetic material. This process is a fundamental aspect of cellular biology, allowing for growth, development and repair within organisms. In normal circumstances, mitosis is a well-regulated process within the body, ensuring that the number of new cells produced matches the number of cells that have died. This balance helps maintain the proper functioning and health of tissues and organs. However, in the case of cancer, this process of mitosis becomes distorted. Cancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled and rapid cell division. Instead of following the normal cycle of growth and cell death, cancer cells continue to undergo mitosis and produce new cells regardless of the need or space within the organism. This excessive cell division leads to the formation of tumor masses, which can disrupt the normal functioning of the body. So, given the context of the question and knowing that cancer cells divide more often than normal cells, it can be inferred that cancer cells perform \\"mitosis\\" more often than regular cells. This accounts for their hasty growth and proliferation, which in turn, causes the medical condition known as cancer. This unmodulated mitosis is what separates cancer cells from normal cells, they do not respond to the body's signals to stop dividing, leading to an overgrowth of cells, and potentially, to malignancy. The other options do not fit as well. \\"Death\\", \\"PDAs\\" (public displays of affection), \\"recovery\\", \\"disease\\", \\"kill them\\", and \\"radiation\\" are not processes or actions performed more often by cancer cells. \\"Grow\\" could be a possible answer, but it is less precise than \\"mitosis\\". Despite their rapid growth, what differentiates cancer cells specifically is the mechanism by which they grow: through excessive and uncontrolled mitosis. Therefore, \\"mitosis\\" is the most accurate and specific answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923). Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The Poet Laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled \\"Sir Henry Wood\\", often referred to by its first line, \\"Where does the uttered music go?\\". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him.

The app, which provides a customizable and interactive notification and lock screen, has proven to be more engaging than the default options on my smartphone. It definitely deserves a 4-star rating, here's why: Pros: 1. Visually appealing - The minimalistic design suits the modern aesthetic that most users prefer. The customizable interface lets me choose various themes and even tweak the layout, as per my taste. 2. Great functionality - I appreciate the fact that the app gives me quick access to my notifications and essential settings right from the lock screen. This has saved me so much time in comparison to navigating through the default Android lock screen. 3. Enhanced security - With com.achep.acdisplay, I can set my own security features, such as the lock screen PIN, pattern, or fingerprint access. This adds an additional layer of security, on top of the default phone settings. However, there are some areas that could be improved to make the app worthy of a perfect 5-star rating: Cons: 1. Battery drainage - I have noticed a slight increase in the battery usage, which I assume is because of the screen timeout customization. This can be a bit concerning for users with older smartphones or those who don’t always have access to a charger. 2. Occasional glitches - Once in a while, the app freezes or lags, especially while interacting with the notifications or changing settings. Although this issue sorts itself out or can be solved by restarting the app, it can hamper the user experience. In conclusion, com.achep.acdisplay is an excellent app for customizing your smartphone's lock screen and improving the ease of accessing notifications and settings.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Cerberus just stared at me. The dog didn't blink, he didn't pant, he didn't move. He just sat in the passenger seat as I drove, relaxed, mouth hanging slightly open, looking at me the way someone examines a menu but can't decide on the chicken or the veal. The desert sky was on fire when the city came into view. Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number. The dog pulled his head back in, then rested his chin on top of the overhead roll-bar, his fur blowing back along his head like the spines of a porcupine. \\"Hello?\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" \\"Dingo! Are you there yet?\\" \\"No, not yet. I'm just outside the city.\\" Vegas flashed and blinked under the starless sky. \\"You get in touch with Mr. Waciejowski?\\" \\"Sure did. He's at the Denny's near the Excalibur. He's trying to stay away from the blackjack tables.\\" \\"Yeah, good for him. He has the box?\\" I could hear Luna stuffing something disgustingly healthy in her mouth. \\"Mmm hmm.\\" \\"He hasn't opened it, has he?\\" She swallowed. \\"Nah. I told him it was filled with old photos.\\" Cerberus shifted in the seat and scratched behind his neck with such force that the whole Jeep shook; a rather unsettling motion at 80 miles an hour. \\"Hey Luna, I've got a question for you.\\" I looked over to see the dog's nostrils flared out in the wind while his lips blew back and revealed his frightening set of teeth. \\"This, uh, this animal spirit guide you had me try to find. Do they ever show up, you know, in person?\\" What does Dingo think Cerberus might need? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - A dinner at Denny's - A box with old photos - A spirit animal guide. Answer:","completion":"- A spirit animal guide"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

As it sounds, the polar zone is near earths poles. The polar zone has very long and cold winters. Brrr!!!! Near the equator is the tropical zone. The tropical zone is known for being hot and wet. Between these two zones is the temperate zone. Temperatures there tend to be mild. Its not too hot and not too cold. You might expect places near the equator to be hot and wet.
