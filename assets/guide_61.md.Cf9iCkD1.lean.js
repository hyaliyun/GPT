You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mario Williams, Houston Texans face biggest test of NFL Week 3 Mario Williams has adjusted well to Houston's transition to the 3-4, recording two sacks and forcing a fumble in the first two weeks. In the past couple of seasons, it became a running story in the viewing room at NBC, as the cast of Football Night in America, including me, watched the Houston Texans take a lead into the fourth quarter and consistently and arduously find a way to blow it. One week they'd get steamrollered with the run by Chris Johnson, another week they'd fumble it away and the defense couldn't make a stop, another week some quarterback would shred a Houston secondary playing with cement feet. Maddening. \\"You're not the only one I heard that from,'' Texans linebacker and defensive captain DeMeco Ryans told me this week. \\"I've gotten that so much from friends the last couple of years. 'Y'all always get up, then find some way to lose it at the end.' We know. We felt that. And coming into this year, we knew we had to find some way to change that.'' So far, so good ... with an asterisk. In the first two weeks of the season, Kerry Collins and the Peyton-less Colts, then Chad Henne and the Dolphins, were no match for the Texans' new Wade Phillips-choreographed defense. The Texans held Indy and Miami to 20 points in eight quarters. Now comes the real test: Drew Brees and the Saints, at the Superdome, Sunday at high noon in New Orleans. \\"Everybody's been talking like that,'' said Ryans, \\"but we're not making it any bigger than any other game. Our mindset each week is to go 1-0.'' Well, OK. But going 1-0 this week is going to be a lot harder than it was either of the previous two weeks. What has the Texans encouraged is how they're playing against the pass and on third down. Those were two big problem areas for the team, as these numbers (table, above) show: All the commotion on the Houston defense in the early going has been Mario Williams' adjustment from a down defensive end in the 4-3 to the weakside outside linebacker in the 3-4, playing next to Ryans. Williams has been good to very good so far. Three other new Texans have made the defense work well, too: left end J.J. Watt (first-round pick from Wisconsin) and two new secondary guys acquired in free agency, free safety Danieal Manning and cornerback Johnathan Joseph. Watt debuted with a bang against the Colts, pressuring Collins five times. Manning has played every snap and been a steadying influence for a young group, and Joseph, before injuring his ankle against Miami (he should be fine this week), has been the kind of physical presence at corner -- and a good cover guy -- Houston GM Rick Smith hoped he'd be when he outbid Detroit for him in July. \\"It's easy to see the impact of Joseph and Manning,'' Ryans said. \\"It's confidence. Our young guys back there, instead of going into a play and thinking, 'Don't get beat deep,' now they're thinking, 'I'm going to make this play. I can jump this route.' When you've got veterans back there who've made so many plays, you have more faith in your own game.'' Ryans, like many of his teammates, is new to Phillips' 3-4. \\"I've taken a liking to it more than I thought I would,'' he said. \\"It allows you to disguise what you're doing better than in the 4-3. In the 4-3, the ends have to show their hand. It's hard to run the fire zones [the zone blitzes when defensive linemen drop in coverage] with the 4-3, but now I feel we're not as limited in what we can do.'' All sounds good now. The matchup of the weekend -- the one I'll be watching with the most interest Sunday afternoon -- is this one. Houston-New Orleans will tell us a lot about whether the Texans have really changed on defense, and whether they'll be real challengers to the AFC elite come January. This week's \\"NFL Podcast With Peter King'' guest is Baltimore pass-rusher Terrell Suggs, and, as is his custom, he had interesting things to say about the Steelers, movies and being the bad guy. You can find the podcast on iTunes and on SI.com. Suggs on the intensity of the Steelers-Ravens rivalry: \\"I love being public enemy No. 1. It's the greatest honor, I think, that I can have against the Pittsburgh Steelers ... On the first third down of last season, when they played here [Baltimore], we got to Ben and we broke his nose ... And that was awesome. I mean, you don't want to hurt anybody, but it just goes to show how physical and grueling this game is. And then early in the third quarter I get my mouth busted. So, I love the simple fact that there was a lot of blood and gore in that game. I tell my mom and my daughter all the time, we're barbarians, we're the gladiators of our time. Him with the broken nose, blood coming out, me with the busted mouth, that game couldn't get any better than that.'' Suggs on the rules to protect defenseless players: \\"I think [the NFL] is getting too soft ... I think it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace to everybody who loves this game. Now don't get me wrong, I don't want to see anybody get hurt ... With that being said, we knew the risk we were taking when we decided we wanted to play professional football. Like I said, some guys are trying to hurt people -- we don't need that in our game. But a great hit, a physical great hit, that's football and you can't take that away. Now the protection over the pansy-ass quarterbacks is a disgrace also.'' Suggs on his favorite recent movie: \\"I loved Black Swan. ... I loved that it kept me on the edge. I loved that they showed the things dancers go through. A lot of people don't respect dance, but you've got to master that just like you master being a football player, just like being a journalist or a surgeon. And it really captured and showed that.'' Next week, I'm going to try something different on the podcast. We'll have a good guest -- still being finalized -- and we're going to hear from one of my favorite writers in the country, Bob McGinn of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, to help me preview the Week 4 games. You've got to listen to Bob, one of the best football writers in America. Philadelphia WR Steve Smith (No. 11). Eli Manning's favorite receiver for three years (Smith caught 107 balls for the Giants in 2009) is just 26, but the Giants allowed him to go to the Eagles in free agency after last season because Smith was recovering from microfracture surgery in his knee, which is always a dangerous career harbinger. But he's recovered well, and he should be on the field for 20 or so snaps in three- and four-wide formations Sunday in the Eagles' home opener. Knowing how much Smith wants to show the Giants they made a big mistake in letting him walk, look for Mike Vick to find Smith a few times. 1. Fakery. Giants safety Deon Grant's diving Monday night got the league's attention, and I hope any further delay-of-game tactics will be met with penalties and fines. I saw that Tampa Bay coach Raheem Morris called the practice \\"great coaching technique.'' I call it bush league. 2. Mike Vick's head. Expect Vick, recovering from a concussion, to play Sunday against the Giants. Expect Andy Reid to call zero designed runs. Expect Vick to run some anyway; it's who he is. Expect Vick not to last 16 starts. By the way, how weird is it that Vick got dinged by his own guy, in his own pocket? 3. Matt Ryan's health. Underrated injury note of this week: Ryan barely worked Thursday in practice, recovering from a couple of whacks to the knee Sunday night against Philly. Ryan's taken 17 hits in the first two games of the season. Atlanta offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey has to find a way to throw more curls and intermediate stuff to keep his quarterback upright. 4. More offense. Record point totals, record passing yards, record fun in the first two weeks of the season. When Matt Hasselbeck riddles the Ravens for 348 yards and Cam Newton has more 400-yard passing games in his first two games than Tom Brady had in his first 145, you know it's shaping up to be fill-the-air-with-footballs season. 5. Miami as road warriors, or a road worry. The stats are bizarre. The Dolphins have lost 11 of 12 at home, and won six of their past eight on the road. They enter a stretch of five road games in their next six outings Sunday at Cleveland. A winnable game, obviously, but how does anyone know which Henne shows up at Cleveland Browns Stadium? 6. Jay Cutler running for his life. Rookie right tackle Gabe Carimi, out, turnstile Frank Omiyale in. Hand it to Matt Forte 38 times against the Pack, Mike Martz. Last week Cutler was kicked in the throat at New Orleans. Wonder which body part will take the biggest hit Sunday. 7. Colin Baxter. He hadn't snapped the ball to Mark Sanchez until Nick Mangold was lying on the field last Sunday in New Jersey with a high ankle sprain. Now the undrafted college free-agent center (waived by the Chargers, signed by the Jets) makes his first career start in a sold-out Black Hole, with Richard Seymour, Tommy Kelly and John Henderson -- with 29 combined years of NFL experience knocking around kids like Baxter -- trying to grind him into the turf. Should be interesting. 8. Tony Romo. Expect Romo to play Monday night against Washington with his broken rib and partially collapsed lung, but in this week's Shameless Plug Dept., you can find out for sure Friday evening when he's a guest on our Versus NFL preview show at 6 p.m. ET. Russ Thaler, Mike Florio and I will get the goods out of Romo, whom we'll interview after Dallas' practice this afternoon. 9. Andy Dalton to A.J. Green. Last week in Denver, they became the first rookie combo to connect on 10 passes in a game. \\"They're really starting to be good together,'' offensive coordinator Jay Gruden said this week. We can see that. 10. Indy trying to keep America from changing the channel Sunday night. It looks bad for the Colts, with the Steelers coming to town. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis, start your engines. You're the Colts' only hope, banging Big Ben around Lucas Oil Field.

This location acts as the main stage for the rapid-fire dialogue and intriguing storyline. The protagonists and supporting characters continuously interact within this room, making it the primary location where the story and its multiple diverting elements unfold. The press room serves as the background for the high-speed tricks that Walter (Cary Grant's character) and Hildy (Rosalind Russell's character) play on each other throughout the movie. This film, which unfolds within a single day, relies heavily on this setting to facilitate the dynamic between the characters, and promote their race to outdo each other. Moreover, the press room in the court's building is the place where 'Earl,' who is on the run and potentially guilty of certain crimes, is hidden. This further builds tension and suspense within the story, making the press room more than a backdrop, but rather a pulse of the narrative's plot. Several interactions also occur in this room between the movie's characters and secondary characters such as witnesses to the alleged crimes, the Mayor, and other reporters, enhancing the narrative's complexity. Additionally, it provides a stage for the interaction between the characters and Bruce's mother and presents multiple perspectives contributing to the storyline. However, it's worth noting that the narrative's entirety is not framed within the press room. There are instances when Bruce, Hildy's fiancee, is on his way to the train station, significant as it delineates Hildy's potential shift in her life choices. Yet, because of various events, she fails to meet him, revealing the intricate set of motivations, personal or otherwise, that influence these characters' actions. In summary, despite the storyline spreading its nuance over several other locations and circumstances, the press room in the court's building remains the primary location and narrative device for most of the movie \\"His Girl Friday.\\" It significantly contributes to the movie's fast-paced narrative and complex conversations around personal motives, professional commitments, and efforts to outdo each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: An Indian navy officer has been killed in an accident on board a ship being built at a dockyard in Mumbai, naval officials told the BBC.","completion":"Title: Tragic Accident Claims the Life of an Indian Navy Officer On Board a Ship in Mumbai Dockyard Introduction A somber atmosphere envelops Mumbai's dockyard, as it becomes the site of a startling tragedy. An Indian navy officer met with a fatal accident on board a ship under construction at the bustling dockyard in Mumbai, naval officials reported to the BBC. The incident casts a spotlight on the safety protocols and measures in place at the shipyard, raising questions and concerns about the well-being and protection of its workforce. Details of the Tragic Accident The Indian navy has not released specific details of the accident, including the cause of the mishap or the identity of the deceased officer. The incident occurred on board a warship being built at the Mumbai dockyard, one of the main shipbuilding centers of the Indian Navy. The Mumbai dockyard, established in 1735, has a long and proud history of serving the Indian maritime forces, pioneering the design and construction of multiple naval platforms over the years. As the investigation into the accident unfolds, it is vital for the Indian Navy and associated authorities to examine the safety protocols implemented at the dockyard. This unfortunate event highlights the importance of taking appropriate and timely measures to prevent any recurrence of such accidents in the future, safeguarding the lives of those working in this highly specialized and hazardous industry. Safety Concerns in the Shipbuilding Industry The shipbuilding industry, given its nature and the complex machinery involved, poses various hazards to the workers. It is not uncommon for shipyard employees to be exposed to several risks, such as being in proximity to heavy equipment, hazardous materials, electrical shocks, and noise pollution. In addition, the ongoing pandemic has further added to the challenges faced by the industry and its workforce. This tragic event emphasizes the need for stringent safety guidelines and regular inspections at the dockyards. Ensuring proper training is provided to workers, ship designers, and naval officers in the handling of high-tech and hazardous equipment can also play a significant role in averting accidents and fatalities. The Role of the Indian Navy and Regulatory Authorities In light of this incident, it becomes crucial for the Indian Navy, along with other regulatory bodies, to take proactive steps to enhance safety procedures and protocols. They must ensure that operational guidelines meet the highest standards, underline the importance of vigilance, and encourage their workforce to identify risks and concerns that may hamper their safety or the safety of their colleagues. Moreover, it is crucial for the regulatory authorities to study and analyze this accident, using the findings to instigate improvements and drive a stronger safety culture throughout the sector. Collaboration between naval officials, dockyard management, and the workforce is imperative in identifying and eliminating risks, reinforcing safety in every aspect of the shipbuilding process. Conclusion The untimely demise of the Indian navy officer in the Mumbai dockyard is a tragic reminder of the inherent dangers associated with the shipbuilding industry. It demands renewed scrutiny, not only in the Indian Navy's shipyards but across the entire industry worldwide. Simultaneously, it serves as an opportunity for the Indian Navy and regulatory authorities to reinforce safety initiatives, ensuring that this vital sector remains as safe as possible for all involved. The men and women who serve in the Indian maritime forces deserve nothing less than a secure and protective environment that supports their work and their unwavering commitment to national security."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Michael C. Graham thinks the things described by some theorists as discrete and consistent response actually are?\\" Context: \\"Emotions have been described by some theorists as discrete and consistent responses to internal or external events which have a particular significance for the organism. Emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, physiological, behavioural, and neural mechanisms. Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity. Thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame. Emotions have also been described as biologically given and a result of evolution because they provided good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced our ancestors. Moods are feelings that tend to be less intense than emotions and that often lack a contextual stimulus.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Michael C. Graham, a psychotherapist, posits that the things described by some theorists as discrete and consistent responses, in the context of emotions, can actually be seen as existing on a continuum of intensity. Rather than identifying emotions as distinct and separate entities that have a specific, unchanging response to certain situations or stimuli, Graham proposes viewing emotions as fluid and overlapping experiences that can vary in intensity depending on factors such as context, individual temperament, and past experiences. According to Graham's perspective, emotions are not just black and white, but involve a spectrum of shades in between. For instance, fear can range from a mild concern to a state of terror, and shame may encompass feelings from simple embarrassment to toxic shame. This idea of an emotional continuum challenges the notion that emotions are consistent and discrete, as it emphasizes the complex and dynamic nature of our emotional experiences which can change depending on the circumstances. This perspective on emotions as existing on a continuum is also supported by the understanding that emotions are biologically given and a result of evolution. Throughout our evolutionary history, humans have faced complex and recurrent problems that required adaptive solutions. Emotions, as a result, have evolved to provide these solutions by allowing humans to navigate complex social and physical environments effectively. This adaptive quality of emotions suggests that they cannot always be confined to a single, discrete category but rather can be fluid and adaptable depending on key variables. In addition, this perspective on emotions is further distinguished from the concept of moods, which are described as less intense feelings that often lack a contextual stimulus. Unlike emotions, which are thought to be brief, coordinated responses to specific events or situations, moods can persist for extended periods and may lack a clear and direct relation to a specific event or situation. By acknowledging the existence and importance of moods, Graham's view of emotions on a continuum further highlights the intricate and multifaceted nature of human emotional experience. In summary, Michael C. Graham believes that the things some theorists describe as discrete and consistent responses should be reconsidered as part of a continuum of emotional intensity. This perspective acknowledges the dynamic, fluid, and adaptable qualities of emotions, which can vary based on context, temperament, and past experiences. By recognizing the existence of an emotional continuum, we can better understand and appreciate the complex nature of our emotional lives and the ways in which emotions have evolved to serve critical adaptive functions for human beings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

Summarize: A vertical garden, like any other type of garden, needs to be planted in an area with good soil drainage and the right combination of shade and sunlight. Figure out what conditions the plants you're growing need to thrive, then choose a suitable area in your yard or on your patio. Most vertical gardens do well with a lot of sunlight. Pick a spot close to a wall if you want your garden to eventually climb the walls of your house. If you're using a trellis, a stake or a pole, be sure to bury it deep in the ground so that it doesn't wobble or fall over. Remember that the garden will get heavier as it grows, and it will need a solid foundation that can stand up to wind and rain. Use a post driver to push your metal or wooden posts deep into the ground. Taking into account the individual needs of the plants you are using, plant seeds or seedlings in holes spaced around the base of the trellis, pole or other structure you are using. Make sure they aren't too close to each other or the structure so that they'll have room to root and grow. ing to their needs. Make sure they get adequate water and that you fertilize them, protect them with mulch, and take other measures they need to grow healthy and strong. When the seedlings get a few inches high, it's time to train them to wrap around the structure you erected. Gently wrap the stems of the plants around the base of the structure, taking care not to bend or break them. Use ties to hold the stems in place as they grow. Don't tie the stems too tightly. This prevents them from growing properly and may actually damage the plant. As the stems begin to grow and wind around the structure, continue using ties to train them to grow in the direction you want them to grow. For vines like hops, tie a string to the trellis a few feet above the ground, and stake it to the ground near the plant. Train the plant up the string until it reaches the trellis. If you are using metal or other slick types of materials, run the string all the way to the top so the vines have something to grab onto.","completion":"A vertical garden is a special kind of garden where plants grow up instead of out. To make a good one, you need a spot with the right amount of sun and good water flow in the soil. You also need something strong, like a wall or trellis, for the plants to climb on, with enough space for their roots. After planting the seeds or baby plants near the wall or trellis, take good care of them by giving them enough water and other things they need. Once the plants start to grow, you can help them climb the structure by wrapping them gently around it, using ties to hold them in place but not too tight.

Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\" After reading the above, is \\"Everyone has already died.\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Why were some evacuations lifted?\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"Everyone has already died\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Why were some evacuations lifted?\\" in the context of the passage provided.

Sir Joseph Rotblat (4 November 1908 - 31 August 2005) was a Polish physicist, a self-described \\"Pole with a British passport\\". Rotblat worked on Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project during World War II, but left the Los Alamos Laboratory after the war with Germany ended. His work on nuclear fallout was a major contribution toward the ratification of the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. A signatory of the 1955 Russell-Einstein Manifesto, he was secretary-general of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from their founding until 1973, and shared, with the Pugwash Conferences, the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize \\"for efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.\\" Rotblat returned to Britain to become senior lecturer and acting director of research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With the help of a Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczyslaw (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage of the fact that she was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled the rest of the family out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography. Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan, and gave a series of public lectures in which he called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research. Rotblat was determined that his research should have only peaceful ends, and so became interested in the medical and biological uses of radiation. In 1949, he became Professor of Physics at St Bartholomew's Hospital (\\"Barts\\"), London, a teaching hospital associated with the University of London. He remained there for the rest of his career, becoming a professor emeritus in 1976. He received his PhD from Liverpool in 1950, having written his thesis on the \\"Determination of a number of neutrons emitted from a source\\". He also worked on several official bodies connected with nuclear physics, and arranged the Atom Train, a major travelling exhibition for schools on civil nuclear energy. At St Bartholomew's, Rotblat worked on the effects of radiation on living organisms, especially on ageing and fertility. This led him to an interest in nuclear fallout, especially strontium-90 and the safe limits of ionising radiation. In 1955, he demonstrated that the contamination caused by the fallout after the Castle Bravo test at Bikini Atoll nuclear test by the United States would have been far greater than that stated officially. Until then the official line had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released. Japanese scientists who had collected data from a fishing vessel, the Lucky Dragon, which had inadvertently been exposed to fallout, disagreed with this. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase at the end of the explosion increased the amount of radioactivity by forty times. His paper was taken up by the media and contributed to the public debate that resulted in the ending of atmospheric tests by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Options: - yes. - it is not possible to tell. - no.","completion":"The premise entails a situation where a barbed tip pierced through, which suggests that the object, most likely a sharp and pointed item such as an arrow or a hooked tool, has successfully broken past a surface or barrier. The barbed tip implies that the object has hooked or jagged parts designed to effectively penetrate or secure its position in whatever it has punctured. The hypothesis, on the other hand, presents a scenario where a blunt tip did not manage to penetrate, indicating that an object with a flat or rounded tip (opposed to sharp or pointed) has failed to break through a surface or barrier. In this case, the object's design might not have been ideal for piercing or penetrating. Now, to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must examine the relationship between these two statements. Entailment, in this context, means that the premise directly implies the truth of the hypothesis or the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. In this case, the premise and the hypothesis describe separate occurrences involving different objects or attributes that change the outcome of the penetration. The premise details a successful penetration with a barbed tip, while the hypothesis documents an unsuccessful attempt with a blunt tip. Consequently, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Their only connection is that they both describe the potential success or failure of an object penetrating another surface or barrier, but they do not share enough information to guarantee that the truth of one statement influences the truth of the other.

A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The writing material we get from the softening effect mentioned in the text is \\"paper\\". The text you provided refers to the effect of water content on various substances, including wood, rawhide, paper, and cloth. It highlights how an increase in the water content tends to make these materials softer and more pliable, that is, easier to mold, bend, or manipulate. Focusing specifically on paper, the text suggests that water has a softening effect on this material. In the context of writing materials, paper is of primary importance. It is fundamental to traditional writing practices and even in the current digital age, the use of paper is ubiquitous. In broader terms, the process of making paper involves the use of water to soften the raw materials, typically wood pulp from trees, and transform it into a pliable substance. Initially, the raw wood is chipped and then mechanically or chemically pulped to break it down into individual fibers. Water is used extensively during this pulping process to facilitate the breakdown of the wood and soften the fibers. The pulp, which is a wet, watery mixture of water and fibers at this stage, is then spread and pressed onto large screens to form thin, flat sheets. As these sheets dry, the water evaporates, leaving behind the interwoven fibers, which constitute the paper. So, the use of water in the manufacture of paper illustrates the softening effect mentioned. By increasing the water content during the production process, the hard, rigid wood is converted into the soft and pliable material we know as paper. This paper can then be used as a writing material. Therefore, based on the information in the provided text, the writing material derived from the softening effect of water is paper."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here's the sentence with properly inserted spaces: \\"Forensic expert: Apple 'admitted involuntarily' have installed backdoor in iOS – Diario TI.\\" Backdoors in software systems refer to those hidden methods and functions which allow a developer or a third party to access and control the system without the user's knowledge or consent. This can be a significant security risk for users as it could potentially grant unauthorized access to personal information, facilitate surveillance, or enable the spread of malware. The mention of the involvement of a forensic expert suggests that this issue might have been discovered during a forensic investigation of an iOS device. Forensic experts are skilled in examining and retrieving information from digital devices and systems, often working in fields such as cybersecurity, digital investigations, and criminal or civil court cases. Their findings can provide critical evidence to support or disprove allegations or suspicions related to such situations. It is essential to note that the term \\"admitted involuntarily\\" implies that Apple might not have intentionally disclosed this information. Instead, it might have come to light due to certain circumstances or statements that inadvertently revealed the existence of the backdoor. This could make the situation even more concerning since users typically expect technology companies like Apple to maintain the highest levels of security and privacy for their devices and software.

News article: ICKES' SHADOWS AVOID THE LIGHT Wednesday, November 13th 1996, 2:01AM ABOUT the same time Bill Clinton was exchanging notes and golf clubs with Arthur Coia two years ago, the Justice Department was preparing to take over his corrupt union. After he raised millions for Clinton's campaign, the feds agreed to give the notorious labor leader a chance to clean up the Laborers International Union of North America. How was that possible? Did Clinton allow a presidential supporter to dodge racketeering charges? These are the kinds of tough questions that would have to be answered by Harold Ickes if the former labor lawyer turned White House deputy chief of staff were ever nominated for a cabinet post and faced a Senate confirmation hearing. And this is why, among other reasons, the crude, foulmouthed attorney is coming home to New York City. Before landing a White House job, Ickes knew a measure of infamy as the unofficial Deputy Mayor for Coverups under former Mayor David Dinkins. He is perhaps even the hand behind the \\"Dear Dad\\" letter, a phony memo that transferred Inner City Broadcasting stock between mayor and son at a time when owning shares in the cable-TV company would be inconvenient for Dinkins, to say the least. Ickes later testified before a federal grand jury investigating the matter, and former Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said he considered indicting Ickes for perjury. After being passed over as Clinton's chief of staff, Ickes said he would like to get another job in the administration, but it is unlikely that he would take a job that required confirmation hearings. Clinton is trying to avoid these kind of collisions. In a way, that is too bad. The questions that have dogged Ickes for years go unanswered. We will miss seeing him challenged by the Republicans. \\"Was the Dinkins stock letter a forgery?\\" The stock transfer was easy work compared with the labor business. Ickes, 56, a Manhattan lawyer and career Democratic infighter, worked for a firm that represented Local 100 of the Hotel Employes and Restaurant Employes International Union from 1983 to 1991. In 1992, the feds filed a civil racketeering suit against the union charging that the Colombo and Gambino crime families controlled it. Ickes later claimed he never knew it was mob connected, but he had sat in court next to union official Anthony (Chick) Amodeo in 1985. At the time, Amodeo was being questioned about the union's relationship with Gambino boss Paul Castellano. \\"Were you ever employed by the Gambino crime family, Mr. Ickes?\\" Ickes was kept away from the White House in 1992 while Mary Shannon Little, a former federal prosecutor, was named by the Justice Department to conduct a special investigation into Ickes and his Mineola, L.I., law firm. She wrote a 57-page report, which was never released to the public. \\"How do you know you have been cleared, Mr. Ickes, if you never read the report clearing you?\\" The New York Times wrote a story vindicating Ickes in 1993, without seeing Little's report. This cleared the way for Ickes to work in the White House. Later we learned that Ickes had worked as the lawyer for then-Times editor Max Frankel. Imagine how Sen. Trent Lott would handle this one. New York Newsday sued to get a look at Little's report on Ickes, but the newspaper folded before the Court of Appeals made a final ruling. It is difficult to know who should get the credit for Clinton's reelection. Ickes helped keep certain Democrats at peace. Mostly he talked to former client the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Ickes detests Dick Morris, who made Clinton a Republican. Ickes was said to have signed Morris' expense accounts. \\"When did you realize Mr. Morris was charging the Clinton campaign for his prostitute?\\" No one knows more secrets then Ickes, who was brought to the White House to work the heath care overhaul and worked Whitewater instead. He contacted a Treasury official to get an update on the investigation. \\"Were you attempting to fix the Whitewater case, Mr. Ickes?\\" The idea of Ickes before a microphone is frightening. He could get labor leaders, even scary ones, in to see Clinton. One of the most devious was Arthur Coia, a regular White House visitor. We have seen copies of signed letters to him from Hillary and Bill. The Justice Department allowed Coia to keep control of the 750,000-member laborers union after he admitted letting mobsters run it. \\"Did you know you were allowing the President of the United States to meet with an alleged mobster?\\" If they ever get around to asking any of these questions at a confirmation hearing for Ickes, you can turn off the lights on Clinton's presidency. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article revolve around the controversies and questions surrounding Harold Ickes, a former labor lawyer turned White House deputy chief of staff. Key aspects of the article include: 1. The relationship between Bill Clinton and Arthur Coia, a labor leader of the Laborers International Union of North America, who raised millions for Clinton's campaign while the Justice Department was preparing to take over his corrupt union. 2. Ickes' involvement in potentially controversial activities, such as the \\"Dear Dad\\" letter involving stock transfers in Inner City Broadcasting, working for a firm that represented Local 100 of the Hotel Employes and Restaurant Employes International Union later charged for racketeering, and sitting in court with a union official affiliated with the Gambino crime family. 3. The 57-page report by Mary Shannon Little, a former federal prosecutor, which investigated Ickes and his Mineola, L.I., law firm. The report was never released to the public, but The New York Times wrote a story vindicating Ickes without seeing the report, possibly due to Ickes' connection with the then-Times editor Max Frankel. 4. Ickes' role in the Clinton administration, where he managed sensitive matters such as talking to Democrat leaders, liaising with controversial labor leaders, and working on the Whitewater scandal. These aspects of the article raise questions about Ickes' integrity, possible perjury, and alleged influence in the Clinton administration. The author implies that a proper investigation and skepticism are needed to address these concerns, and that the controversies surrounding Ickes could potentially have significant consequences for Clinton's presidency if openly scrutinized."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: According to decades-long research, women who took low to moderate daily doses of aspirin had a reduced death rate, especially from heart disease. The research, based on data from a major trial that has tracked almost 80,000 women since 1976, found that women who reported using aspirin on a regular basis had a 25 percent lower risk of death from any cause than women who didn't take the drug. The risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 38 percent lower for aspirin users, and there was also a 12 percent reduction in cancer deaths that took effect after a decade of aspirin use, the researchers found in their report based on the Nurses' Health Study. However, an accompanying editorial in the journal cautioned that the results were open to debate and far from definitive. The dissenting editorial was based on results of an earlier trial by the Women's Health Study, which followed almost 40,000 women for 11 years and found no reduction in overall deaths. Therefore, the new findings \\"cannot overcome the accumulated evidence that aspirin is not particularly effective for the primary prevention of death from cardiovascular disease in women.\\" \\"This is a complicated issue,\\" said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, leading author of the new report. \\"We understand that aspirin has potential health benefits, but who would aspirin therapy be appropriate for?\\" There are \\"areas of disagreement that need further study\\" before that question can be answered, Chan said. But there is information from the two large studies and other trials that can help guide women and their physicians, he said. And anyone who is thinking about daily aspirin \\"should really talk with doctors about the benefits and risks.\\" Question: The new report clearly benefits the women suffering Answer: Answer:","completion":"The new report suggests that women who took low to moderate daily doses of aspirin had a reduced death rate, especially from heart disease. However, it is essential for women to discuss with their doctors about the benefits and risks of daily aspirin use before incorporating it into their routine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? The Emperor's every wish was immediately carried out.","completion":"Yes, according to the strictest standards of English grammar, the sentence \\"The Emperor's every wish was immediately carried out\\" can be considered correct by a linguist. Let's break down the sentence to understand why: 1. \\"The Emperor's every wish\\": This phrase is functioning as a singular noun phrase and the subject of the sentence. \\"Emperor's\\" is a possessive noun that modifies \\"every wish,\\" indicating that the wishes belong to the Emperor. The usage of \\"every\\" in front of \\"wish\\" implies that this refers to all of the Emperor's wishes, not just one or some. 2. \\"was immediately carried out\\": This is the predicate of the sentence, detailing what was done to the Emperor's wishes. \\"Was\\" is the simple past tense of the auxiliary verb \\"be\\" and is used here with a passive voice form. The act involving the Emperor's wishes is not performed by the emperor (the subject), so it is expressed in the passive voice. \\"Immediately\\" is an adverb that modifies \\"carried out,\\" specifying the speed at which the wishes were enacted. Finally, \\"carried out\\" is a phrasal verb, often used to imply that the action was performed or completed successfully. Though the sentence might sound slightly formal or old-fashioned due to the construction and usage of the passive voice and possessive noun, it adheres to English grammar rules and is therefore grammatically correct. Linguists appreciate such sentences because they can carry a lot of meaning and nuances, and the ordering of words is important. Given this, the sentence \\"The Emperor's every wish was immediately carried out\\" is not only grammatically correct but additionally, it paints a vivid picture of an Emperor whose every wish or command is immediately acted upon or implemented, highlighting the obedience of the subjects and the power and authority wielded by the Emperor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Also, it states that the proposed rule has been designed to minimize the impact on small entities while retaining the benefits of encouraging television broadcast programming that satisfies the requirements of the Children's Television Act of 1990. Hypothesis: The act requires that broadcasters include content favorable towards Congress. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise does not specify the content of the programming that broadcasters should include to satisfy the requirements of the Children's Television Act of 1990. While the Act intends to ensure that television broadcast programming benefits children through provision of educational, informational, and appropriate entertainment content, it doesn't specifically require content that is favorable towards Congress. In fact, this Act is completely unrelated to the portrayal of Congress or any political entity but focuses on ensuring that broadcasters produce and air content that is beneficial to the overall development of children. This includes a range of considerations such as the number of hours of programming dedicated to children, the appropriateness of content for various age groups, and the quality of the educational materials in the content. Hence, the hypothesis, stating that the act requires broadcasters to include content favorable towards Congress, is not supported by or related to the information presented in the premise. What the premise highlights, instead, is a supposed rule designed to balance the benefits to be gained from adhering to the Children's Television Act of 1990 with the need to minimize the impact of these regulations on small entities, presumably small broadcasters or television stations. So, in conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The Children's Television Act of 1990 is not focused on political messaging or the portrayal of Congress, but on child-centered and developmentally appropriate television programming. Therefore, the assertion that the Act requires content favorable toward Congress is not justified by the premise given."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: I stood outside New York's Madison Square Garden and just stared, almost speechless. I was a farm boy from County Kilkenny, a child who some thought would never walk, let alone go as far as I had in the world. From the day I was born, there was a problem. The doctors at the Dublin hospital told my parents I had phocomelia, a _ that affected both legs below the knee, which were outward and shorter than normal and each foot had just three toes. Life was tough. I couldn't stand, much less walk. I rarely, left the farmhouse---and then only in someone's arms. Mam bundled me up whenever she took me to town, no matter the season. \\"The world will see him when he can walk,\\" she told Dad. \\"And he will walk.\\" Mam devoted herself to helping me. She tried everything to get me on my feet. When I was three, she and Dad took me to a clinic in Dublin. A few weeks later we returned to Dublin with my artificial limbs .

The Twists of the Sean Bell Case (7 Letters) The trials of the individual officers may address only the symptomatic ills of a society in which institutional racism pervades the systems of law and order. But if the trials encourage the nation to take a closer look at the ways in which Sean Bell’s death was part of a broader pattern of structural violence, then they will do more for the pursuit of justice than senseless killings have ever done. Emma Tai Providence, R.I., March 20, 2007 In his haste to exonerate the officers charged in the shooting of Sean Bell, Robert Leuci dismisses claims of police racism by noting how two of the shooting officers are black. But the point of identifying police racism is not to identify singularly racist officers. Rather, it is to note that black men are inordinately subject to violence at the hands of the state. Frequently, this violence is justified with a statement that the officers feared for their safety. And almost invariably, juries sympathize with the officers. Perhaps the racism comes in not because individual offers set out to beat or shoot black men, but because officers and jurors are prepared to see black bodies — such as, we remember, the severely beaten body of Rodney King — as sites of potential violence. As with most injustices in our world, the source is not individual evil, but structural conditions that bestow great suffering on specific populations. Chad LavinAtlanta, March 20, 2007 Sure, many of us laypeople are quick to judge the actions of the police under duress, and most of us admit that we cannot imagine what we would do in the situations they face. But just as Robert Leuci warns us to beware of characters like Al Sharpton, who “have made careers out of demonizing the police,” it is equally important to be aware that some cops do take their aggression out on the public. My own experiences with the police, however few, have been positive, leaving little basis for judgment. But there certainly are cops who react violently at the first sign of danger, real or imagined. Some are rookies, overly enthusiastic about their new authority, some are veterans harboring years of frustration at infinite injustice. Regardless, concluding that “you had to be there” is no less dangerous than assuming that cops who shoot are mechanically corrupt. Stephanie Gray Chicago, March 20, 2007 I would add a comment to Robert Leuci’s excellent article. In a combat situation it is taught that you keep firing until the threat is eliminated. There is no such thing as an absolute number of shots that is justified across the board. In addition, there is no such procedure as “shoot to disable.” That is a fantasy from movies and television: shoot the assailant in the shoulder, shoot the gun right out of the assailant’s hand. Bob Raphael New York, March 20, 2007 Robert Leuci shows the blind spots that he admits plagued him after the Abner Louima tragedy — he assumes the officers acted as he would. There are other explanations for the events he describes, explanations that don’t require believing that Sean Bell, for no reason at all, tried to kill a police officer. Late at night, shady neighborhood in the aftermath of a heated argument. You’re approached by a man with a gun — but no uniform. You had to be there, but ask yourself, what would you have done? Eric C. Williams Brooklyn, March 20, 2007 While Robert Leuci makes a strong case for the officers now indicted in Sean Bell’s death, his own rationale may undermine his argument. Mr. Leuci believes that the officers indicted — under intense pressure, or mortal danger — reacted the only way they knew how; therefore, Sean Bell is to blame. But can’t we say the same thing for Mr. Bell? If he didn’t know that the men approaching him were cops, and believed that his life was in danger, then he reacted the only way he knew how and is not to blame. If this truly is the case, furthermore, Mr. Leuci is wrong in saying that Mr. Bell used his car as a “3,000-pound weapon” and “twice tried to run the officer down.” Chad SmithGreat Neck, N.Y., March 20, 2007 A version of this letter appears in print on , on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: The Twists of the Sean Bell Case.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the names of the person who help take some cattle across the country? , can you please find it? In 1865 Australia, the two Marston brothers, bold Dick and sensitive Jim, are drawn into a life of crime by their ex-convict father Ben and his friend, the famous cattle thief Captain Starlight. They help take some cattle their father and Starlight have stolen across the country to Adelaide, where they are sold with Starlight impersonating an English gentleman claiming to own the rustled herd. The two brothers take their share of the money and go to Melbourne. On board ship they meet the Morrison sisters, greedy Kate and nice Jean, who are romanced by Dick and Jim respectively. They read that Starlight has been arrested, and return home, where they and their father narrowly escape arrest. The brothers are then reunited with Starlight, who has left prison, and join him and some other men in robbing a coach, in which a trooper is shot and killed. Dick and Jim go to the gold fields to make enough money to escape to America. There they are reunited with Kate, who is married but is still interested in Dick, and Jean, who Jim marries. Just as the brothers are about to leave to start a new life, Captain Starlight and his gang (including Ben Marston) arrive to rob the local bank. During the robbery several people are killed by Starlight's gang (although not by Starlight), including a mother protecting child. Jim Marston is captured by locals and is about to be lynched but rescued by a trooper who comes to arrest him. Dick rescues Jim from the trooper. but is killed in the attempt. Jim hides out with Starlight and his father but misses his wife too much and goes back to see her. Starlight and Ben Marston are killed in a shoot out with police. Jim Marston is arrested.

Which forest will have more wood-decay fungi? The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest. Hint: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3] Answer:","completion":"Peak Forest will have more wood-decay fungi, as it presents more signs of water saturation than Valley Forest. This leads to a higher rate of decay in wood in Peak Forest, making it a more favorable environment for wood-decay fungi to colonize and proliferate. In contrast, Valley Forest is dryer and has a drainage system composed of ditches dug by the locals, which significantly reduces the rate of wood decay."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Write highlights for this article: The UN's full and final findings on the state of the planet's climate have been published (pictured) Global warming is unequivocal and human influence has been the dominant cause since the mid-20th century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC's full and final findings on the state of the planet’s climate have been published and the report, which was put together for the UN, says that limiting climate change will require ‘substantial and sustained’ reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The findings of the report, which includes the comment that global warming is 'almost definitely' caused by humans, were approved by the member governments of the IPCC in September. The final version has now been released to provide detailed information to policymakers and the scientific community. The Working Group I Fifth Assessment Report has 1,500 pages of text, 600 diagrams, cites 9,000 scientific publications and claims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the physical science basis of climate change. ‘The report provides information about what has changed in the climate system, why it has changed, and how it will change in the future,’ said Thomas Stocker, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I. It says that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, already at levels not seen in at least 800,000 years, will persist for many centuries and ‘continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system’. Enlarge. The IPPC reported revealed that it is 'extremely likely' that human activity is the dominant cause for global warming. It claims a rise in temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (right) will cause snow cover to decrease by 25 per cent by the end of the 21st century. But the report failed to conclusively explain why the rise in global average surface temperatures had largely 'paused' over the past two decades (left) The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific Ocean are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century (right). In many midlatitude. and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease from the 1986-2005 period (left) Since the publication of the IPCC report, more Americans than ever before believe that global warming isn't happening. The Yale Project on Climate Change Communication study, which was published last month, found the number has risen to 23 percent, up seven percentage points since April 2013. The latest survey, taken in November 2013, finds that the majority of Americans — 63 percent — do believe in climate change, and 53 percent are 'somewhat' or 'very' worried about the consequences. The researchers also say Americans believe that even if it exists, global warming is not their problem. 'Over years of research, we have consistently found that, on average, Americans view global warming as a threat distant in space and time – a risk that will affect far away places, other species, or future generations more than people here and now,' the report says. 'We still find this same pattern, in which fewer than half of Americans (38%) believe they personally will be harmed a 'moderate amount' or a 'great deal' by global warming. The report highlights a number of doomsday scenarios, including extreme storms, heat waves, rising sea levels and the melting of Greenland. Among its findings are that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 26-82cm by the end of the century. But it concedes that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years, despite growing amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. Temperature rises have dropped from 0.12°C per decade since 1951 to just 0.05°C per decade since 1998. This slowdown has been seized upon by climate sceptics who claim carbon dioxide is not as damaging as has been suggested. IPCC scientists, however, believe the pause is temporary and a return to 'substantial warming' is expected in coming decades. Perhaps most controversially, the report it says that humans are between 95 per cent and 100 per cent to blame for the warming of the planet since the mid 20th Century and this level of certainty among scientists is a boost from the 2007 report, which said that global warming was ‘very likely’ to have been caused by humans. ‘Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,’ says the report. CO2 concentrations have. increased by 40 per cent since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions, claims the IPCC. The ocean has absorbed about 30 per cent of the emitted. anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification. ‘This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4 (the last IPCC report). It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,’ it adds. An ‘atlas’ of global and regional climate projections is included in the final version of the report, which contains a series of maps showing temperature and rainfall estimates for 35 regions of the world. In order to show the way drafts and reviews of the report were put together, the IPCC has also released all of the 54,677 comments by experts that informed the final version. Scientists claim that global average sea levels will continue to rise during the 21st century under all temperature scenarios presented in the report. They say it will 'very likely' exceed that observed during 1971-2010 due to increased ocean warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Summarize: The Scottish government is considering whether to permanently reintroduce the animals to the wild, with a trial scheme underway in Knapdale, Argyll. Studies concluded that the Tayside beavers, which originated from escapes or illegal releases, had settled in well to the local environment. Proposals to trap or cull the rogue beavers proved controversial. The Scottish government agreed to monitor the situation for three years when the matter was last raised in 2012, faced with the alternative options of removing the animals or accepting their presence. The findings from the Tayside Beaver Study Group will help inform a government decision on the future of the animals in Scotland, alongside a trial reintroduction of the animals at Knapdale in Argyll. There had been fears that the beavers could damage ecosystems or spread diseases, but the study group set up by Scottish Natural Heritage suggests they have settled in effectively, despite some land management issues. The beavers, which are of the Eurasian species once native to Britain, have been found in rivers and lochs stretching from Kinloch Rannoch, Kenmore and Crieff in the west to Forfar, Perth and Bridge of Earn in the east. It is likely they are of Bavarian or German descent. They are successfully producing young and still spreading through the Tayside area, and are free from diseases of concern to humans, domestic animals and other wildlife. The most significant impact beavers could have is on agricultural land, for example by building dams on the River Isla or the Tay and causing flooding on arable land nearby. A number of methods of protecting trees from being gnawed and felled have proved successful, preventing flooding, but the impact of the animals have had by burrowing into flood banks and damming drainage ditches has proved more difficult to manage. The study group said this would need to be addressed if the beavers are to be left in place, as 70% of reported negative impacts due to beaver activity stated a financial cost as a consequence. David Bale, chairman of the study group and SNH's area manager for Tayside and Grampian, said the finding were \\"very useful\\". He said: \\"The findings show there is no evident risk of diseases being transmitted from the Tayside beavers to other animals, or indeed to humans. \\"The genetic tests tell us that they would be suitable for permanent reintroduction to Scotland, because they are Eurasian rather than North American beavers. They are also varied enough genetically to make a reasonable first step towards a full reintroduction if that was the decision of the Scottish Government. \\"Our work documenting the impacts of beavers on land management interests has shown that in many situations, beavers are likely to cause few concerns. \\"But if they were to be permanently reintroduced, efficient, effective and affordable ways of managing and reducing potentially significant impacts on intensively farmed land and other interests would have to be found.\\" The reports from the study group will be submitted to the government, along with other beaver studies, in May. A spokesman for Scottish Land and Estates said: \\"We have been an active member of the Tayside Beaver Study Group and are keen that as much information as possible is available to the government ahead of the decision on the future of the beaver in Scotland. \\"We are not opposed to beaver ever being reintroduced to Scotland; we simply want to ensure that any reintroduction, whatever the species, is only progressed after a robust assessment and justification process which ensures a competent decision in which impacts on land management have been fully acknowledged and accommodated. \\"Scottish Land and Estates was pleased to host the environment minister on a visit to some Tayside farmers recently to discuss beaver impacts on land management and we are pleased that the report acknowledges that the Tayside population does have an impact and that if they were to be permanently reintroduced, efficient, effective and affordable ways of managing and reducing potentially significant impacts on intensively farmed land and other interests would have to be found.\\" Summary:","completion":"The Scottish government is considering permanently reintroducing beavers to the wild, following a successful trial in Knapdale, Argyll. The Tayside beavers, likely of Bavarian or German descent, have adapted well to the local environment and pose no evident disease risks to humans or animals. The Tayside Beaver Study Group's findings will inform the government's decision on the matter. However, managing the beavers' impact on agricultural land, such as building dams and causing flooding, needs to be addressed in order to minimize potential financial costs. The final decision on permanent reintroduction will be made after reviewing various beaver studies in May."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A subseries stemming from the main \\"Final Fantasy\\" series, it is a collection of video games, animated features and short stories based in the world and continuity of \\"Final Fantasy VII\\". Officially announced in 2003 with the reveal of \\"\\", the series' core products are three video games and one movie release. Alongside these are tie-in products and spin-offs including books, mobile games and an original video animation. \\"Advent Children\\" and the mobile title \\"\\" are sequel and prequel to \\"VII\\", respectively focusing on Cloud Strife, the original game's main protagonist, and covert operatives known as the Turks. \\"\\" follows the story of Zack Fair, an important minor character in \\"VII\\", while \\"\\", which acts as a sequel to \\"Advent Children\\" follows Vincent Valentine, one of the original's optional characters. Context_2 : The Return of the King is the third and final volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", following \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"The Two Towers\\". The story begins in the kingdom of Gondor, which is soon to be attacked by the Dark Lord Sauron. Context_3 : The Betrayal of Bindy Mackenzie, (also The Murder of Bindy MacKenzie in the US and Becoming Bindy MacKenzie in the UK) is a 2006 novel for young adults by Jaclyn Moriarty. It is the third of a series set in the north-western suburbs of Sydney, where the author grew up. The story focuses on a minor character from Moriarty's second young adult novel, \\"Finding Cassie Crazy\\". The story is told through letters, memos and transcripts, similar to the structure of other novels by the author. Context_4 : I vinti (English: \\"The Vanquished\\" ) is a 1953 drama film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni and starring Franco Interlenghi, Anna Maria Ferrero and Eduardo Ciannelli. The film is composed of three stories about youths who commit murders. In the French story set in Paris, a group of high school students kill one of their colleagues for his money. In the Italian story set in Rome, a university student is involved in smuggling cigarettes. In the English story set in London, a lazy poet finds the body of a woman and tries to sell his story to the press. The film was a project of Film Constellation to Suso Cecchi d'Amico, who proposed Antonioni as director. This film was screened out of competition at 1953 Venice Film Festival. Context_5 : Forlong the Fat is a fictional character in the Middle-earth universe created by J. R. R. Tolkien. He is a supporting character in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", appearing in the third volume, \\"The Return of the King\\". However, he was cut from the . Context_6 : Ghân-buri-Ghân, or simply Ghân, is a character in the epic fantasy \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien. Ghân is the chief of the Drúedain, also known as the Woses, the wild men who inhabit Drúadan Forest. In the third volume of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", \\"The Return of the King\\", he leads Théoden, King of Rohan, through the forest so he can reach Minas Tirith with reinforcements. In return, Théoden promises that his people will have peace with the Drúedain, and that his people will wage war and drive away the \\"gorgûn\\" (Orcs), that Ghân hates so much and that have been troubling the Drúedain. In the end of \\"The Return of the King\\" Aragorn, the newly crowned King of Gondor, gives the Forest of Drúadan to Ghân and his people, decreeing that none shall enter again without his leave. Context_7 : The Doors Open, published by Hodder and Stoughton in England in 1949 and by Walker and Company in the United States in 1962, is the third novel by the British mystery and thriller writer Michael Gilbert. Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Like his first two books, it features Inspector Hazlerigg, although not in a major role. It is, in fact, a very diffuse book in terms of its characters. Angus McMann, who was the chief protagonist of Gilbert's previous book, They Never Looked Inside, is briefly mentioned on the first page and makes a later appearance as a minor character. Hazlerigg does not appear until page 24 and thereafter only at intervals throughout the book. There are, in actuality, three other protagonists who, along with Hazlerigg, share the role of driving the narrative. One is Noel Anthony Pontarlier Rumbold (\\"Nap\\"), a junior solicitor in his father's London firm. Nap had spent four months on dangerous missions with the French maquis in occupied France during the war and is, apparently, still a Lieutenant-Colonel, D.S.O. A few years later he will be a main character in Gilbert's well-received novel \\"Death Has Deep Roots\\". Patrick (Paddy) Yeatman-Carter, an acquaintance of Nap's, is another lead character, as is his uncle, Alfred Lord Cedarbrook, a man with an astonishing background, much sought after by both the Foreign Office and the War Office during WWII and now, apparently, still affiliated with the Secret Service. As well as being a linguist, explorer, soldier, and diplomat, he also has a law degree. All three of them, to one degree or another, carry out private investigations, sometimes with the backing of Hazlerigg, sometimes not. Context_8 : Peregrin Took, more commonly known as Pippin, is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novel \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". He is closely tied with his friend and cousin, Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry), the two are usually together during most of the story. Pippin and Merry are introduced as a pair of young hobbits who become ensnared in fellow hobbit Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the One Ring. In this regard, Pippin is a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. He and Merry become separated from the rest of the group at the breaking of the Fellowship and spend much of \\"The Two Towers\\" with their own story line. Impetuous and curious, he enlists (in \\"The Return of the King\\") as a soldier in the army of Gondor and fought in several battles during the War of the Ring. In the epilogues to the main story, Pippin returns to the Shire and becomes \\"Thain\\" or hereditary leader of the land before dying and being buried as a hero in Gondor. Context_9 : The parallel novel is a piece of literature written within, derived from, or taking place during, the framework of another work of fiction by the same or another author. Parallel novels or \\"reimagined classics\\" are works of fiction that \\"borrow a character and fill in his story, mirror an 'old' plot, or blend the characters of one book with those of another\\". These stories further the works of already well known novels by focusing on a minor character and making them the major character. The revised stories may have the same setting and time frame and even the same characters. Context_10 : A supporting character is a character in a narrative that is not focused on by the primary storyline, but appears or is mentioned in the story enough to be more than just a minor character or a cameo appearance. Sometimes, supporting characters may develop a complex back-story of their own, but this is usually in relation to the main character, rather than entirely independently. In television, supporting characters may appear in more than half of the episodes per season. fact_1 : Forlong the Fat is a fictional character in the Middle-earth universe created by J. R. R. Tolkien. fact_2 : He is a supporting character in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", appearing in the third volume, \\"The Return of the King\\". fact_3 : The story begins in the kingdom of Gondor, which is soon to be attacked by the Dark Lord Sauron.

Q:Information: - The ghazal (Arabic/Persian/Urdu: ) is a poetic form with rhyming couplets and a refrain, each line sharing the same meter. A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient, originating in Arabic poetry in Arabia long before the birth of Islam. It is derived from the Arabian panegyric \\"qasida\\". The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In style and content, it is a genre that has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. - The Patiala gharana is one of the \\"gharanas\\" of vocal Hindustani classical music. It was founded by Ustad Fateh Ali Khan and Ustad Ali Baksh Khan (known as Alia-fattu) and was initially sponsored by the Maharaja of Patiala, Punjab and was known for ghazal, thumri, and khyal styles of singing. - Patiala is a city in southeastern Punjab, in northern India. It is the fourth largest city in the state and is the administrative capital of Patiala district. Patiala is located around the \\"Qila Mubarak\\" (the Fortunate Castle). It was constructed by chieftain 'Baba Ala Singh', who founded the royal dynasty of the Patiala State in 1763. - Begum Parveen Sultana ( Assamese : ) ( born 10 July 1950 ) is an Assamese Hindustani classical singer of the Patiala Gharana . She was awarded the Padma Shri ( 1976 ) , Padma Bhushan ( 2014 ) by the Government of India , and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award , 1999 , given by Sangeet Natak Akademi , India 's National Academy of Music , Dance and Drama . - Hindustani classical music is the Hindustani or North Indian style of Indian classical music. The style is sometimes called \\"North Indian classical music\\" or \\"Shstriya Sangt\\". It is a tradition that has been evolving since the 12th century CE, in North India. Today, it is one of the two subgenres of Indian classical music, the other being Carnatic music, the classical tradition of South India. - Khyal (or Khayal, Urdu: , Hindi: ) is the modern genre of classical singing in North India. Its name comes from an Arabic word meaning \\"imagination\\". It is thought to have developed out of Dhrupad introducing frequent taans and alankars in it. It appeared more recently than dhrupad, is a more free and flexible form, and it provides greater scope for improvisation. Like all Indian classical music, khyal is modal, with a single melodic line and no harmonic parts. The modes are called raga, and each raga is a complicated framework of melodic rules.

Please write a short summary for the following article: German Police Detain Migrant on Terror Suspicions BERLIN—German police detained an asylum seeker suspected of plotting an attack for Islamic State, the federal prosecutor’s office said Thursday, the latest evidence of a mounting terror threat posed by the arrival last year of hundreds of thousands of migrants into the country. The 27-year-old man, identified by federal prosecutors as Ashraf Al-T., allegedly received approval from an ISIS operative in Syria to carry out an attack on Germans in the near future, the prosecutor’s office said. The man was taken into custody in Berlin late Wednesday, and his apartment in the city’s Schöneberg district was searched, according to the prosecutor. By the end of the day Thursday, the suspect will go before an investigating judge with the federal supreme court, who will decide if there is sufficient evidence to keep holding the man. The nationality of the suspect who arrived in Germany in 2015 remained unclear. Police initially identified the man as Syrian but an official familiar with the case said he might in fact be a Tunisian who used Syrian identification. The arrest adds to escalating tension in Germany over the security risks arising from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to open the country’s doors to nearly 900,000 asylum seekers in 2015 alone. As the wave of migrants entering the county peaked late last year, authorities brushed aside suggestions that the surge could include attackers linked with ISIS. A year later, a lengthening list of arrests and a series of attacks by refugees have led officials to reassess the threat and raise alarms about security. “It is very good [that] this man was taken off the streets,” German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière said. “Security services had been watching him for some time.” Officials said it was still unclear how far along plans were for an attack but authorities still felt compelled to act, said Bernd Palenda, head of the state intelligence agency in Berlin. “As we had no overview over the risks—what might be done and when it might start—we acted fast,” said Mr. Palenda, The evidence authorities possessed pointed to a potential lone attacker, he said. Security officials have been warning that more lone attackers appeared to be steered from ISIS operatives based in the terror militia’s territory. The number of terror suspect cases has grown in recent months. Last week, the federal prosecutor charged a 19-year-old Syrian immigrant with supporting ISIS and scouting for potential targets in Germany. In September, police detained three Syrians who had traveled to Germany late last year in what officials said might be the first arrest of a cell sent to Germany specifically to commit terror attacks. German authorities were alerted to the latest threat by a foreign intelligence service, according to another official. The man who was detained applied for asylum in Berlin a year ago and used several identities since he arrived, the official added. Last month, a Syrian refugee suspected of plotting attacks on Berlin airports escaped during a police raid and later hung himself in his jail cell after being detained. Mr. Palenda, the Berlin state intelligence chief, said there appeared to be no connection between this man and the one detained Thursday.

Mike had a slug problem, but had almost no aphides. Which farmer didn't learn that aphids are resistant to organophosphates? Hint: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect.

The department has told Township High School District 211 that it has 30 days to comply with anti-discrimination law Title IX and allow the student, who identifies as a girl, to use the locker room, reports the Chicago Sun-Times, which notes that the long-running case has attracted a lot of attention because of its implications for school districts across the country. The school district maintains that allowing the student to use the girls locker room would violate the privacy rights of other students. The civil rights complaint was filed two years ago and a deal was almost reached last week, when the district used curtains to create a private area in the locker room, reports the Chicago Tribune. The student agreed to use the area to change, but a spokesman for the ACLU of Illinois, which is representing her, tells the Tribune that the case went ahead because the district made it clear that the student would be required to use the private area, which amounts to \\"blatant discrimination\\"—and sends the message that she is not accepted. In a statement, the student said she had been \\"stigmatized\\" and the ruling made Monday a \\"good day for all students, but especially those who are transgender all across the nation,\\" reports the Daily Herald. (The White House now has a transgender official.) Expand this summary.","completion":"The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has found that a high school district in the Chicago area violated a transgender student's civil rights and federal law by not allowing her to use the girls' locker room. The Township High School District 211 has been given 30 days to comply with Title IX, an anti-discrimination law, and permit the student, who identifies as a girl, access to the locker room. This case has garnered significant attention due to its potential implications for school districts across the United States. The school district has argued that allowing the transgender student to use the girls' locker room would infringe upon the privacy rights of other students. The civil rights complaint was filed two years ago and almost reached a resolution when the district installed curtains to create a private area in the locker room. Although the transgender student agreed to use the private area for changing, the district insisted that she be required to use it, which the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois, representing the student, considered \\"blatant discrimination\\". This requirement also sent a message to the student that she was not fully accepted. Following the ruling, the student expressed relief, stating that it was a \\"good day for all students, but especially those who are transgender all across the nation\\". The outcome of this case may have significant consequences for transgender students and their interactions within school environments. It underlines the importance of understanding and respecting their rights, which may promote a shift in policies and attitudes across educational institutions. The case also highlights the ongoing debate around transgender rights and privacy concerns in various areas of society. It serves as a reminder that a balance must be struck between preserving the rights of transgender individuals and addressing the concerns of others in shared spaces. As more similar cases emerge, school districts and other institutions may need to reassess their policies to ensure they are in compliance with anti-discrimination laws while fostering inclusive and supportive environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ukraine has refused to call a truce with pro-Russian rebels vowing to end their bloody insurgency with force unless they lay down their arms. Ukrainian forces have scored a string of surprise military successes since the weekend that forced most of the militias to retreat to the sprawling eastern industrial hubs of Donetsk and Lugansk. The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has now ordered his troops to blockade the insurgents inside the cities and cut them off from any further arms supplies. A local resident in the eastern Ukraine city of Slavyansk speaks to Ukrainian servicemen sitting on top of their tank. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers have been patrolling the streets of Slavyansk today after the city was recaptured from pro-Russian rebels. Troops also stood guard outside the front of Slavyansk city hall today after the defence minister said Ukraine would not negotiate with pro-Russian rebels. The unconditional stance reflects a new confidence in Kiev and comes as they are on the verge of quashing the uprising. This is despite EU leaders pushing for a diplomatic solution to the conflict as well as Russia own efforts to force Ukraine to make compromises to preserve the east of the country's links to Moscow. Defence minister Valeriy Geletey said in a statement: 'Now, any negotiations are possibly only after the rebels completely lay down their arms.' The president made an unannounced visit to Slavyansk, a former rebel-held city reclaimed by Kiev on Saturday and said that talks with the uprising's commanders were impossible because most were now hiding in Moscow. Mr Poroshenko told reporters that he would only speak to 'the real masters of Donbass - the steel workers and miners' in the conflict zone. A woman looks through a broken window in her house after shelling in Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Local residents said the shelling came from the Ukrainian army. A car travels past a building in Luhansk, that has been damaged after shelling. It is thought that most of the militias have retreated to the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has now ordered his troops, pictured, to blockade the insurgents inside the cities. Meanwhile separatist leader Valeriy Bolotov claimed that his men had managed to actually push back Ukrainian troops from parts of Lugansk and had received fresh supplies of anti-aircraft and artillery guns. The Ukraine's message to the rebels will now mean Russian president Vladimir Putin faces a tough choice between dealing a blow to Russia's economy by further boosting support for the rebels or seeing his own popularity suffer by taking no action at all. Germany's Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding said: 'He may either have to step up his support for the pro-Russian insurgents who are now on the defensive or he may be seen as letting Ukraine advance on the ground in Donbass. 'The former could trigger more serious sanctions and further capital flight from Russia. The latter could hurt his popularity and his 'strongman' image in Russia where (he) had whipped up nationalist sentiment in the last five months.'

Separatist leader Valeriy Bolotov claimed that his men had managed to actually push back Ukrainian troops. It has been claimed that the rebels, such as those pictured, have received fresh supplies of anti-aircraft missiles and artillery guns. The Ukraine's message to the rebels will now mean Russian president Vladimir Putin faces a tough choice. EU leaders had hoped that a new truce and a promise from the Kremlin not to meddle could have been agreed. French president Francois Hollande said he intended to press Mr Poroshenko on a truce tomorrow during a joint call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile the U.S. has consistently backed the campaign waged by Ukrainian troops since the Ukrainian president promised to quickly quash the uprising after his election in May. The United States views Ukraine's territorial integrity as vital to European security and important to halting Russian President Vladimir Putin's seeming ambition to resurrect a tsarist or post-Soviet empire. US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki reiterated on Monday that 'the government of Ukraine is defending the country of Ukraine, and I think they have every right to do that.'","completion":"Ukraine has refused to call a truce with pro-Russian rebels, insisting on the use of force to end the bloody insurgency unless the rebels lay down their arms.

Question: what was dr. hartz's patient's face covered by?cov Movie title: The Lady Vanishes Movie plot: In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her. In the compartment are other passengers who appear not to understand English.Iris and Miss...","completion":"Froy begin to chat and enjoy each other's company. As they talk, Miss Froy briefly mentions the existence of Dr. Hartz, a leading brain surgeon traveling on the train. Soon after, Iris dozes off again. When she wakes up, she finds that Miss Froy has vanished, and none of the other passengers in the compartment remember seeing her. They suggest that Iris's head injury might be causing her to imagine things. Determined to find Miss Froy, Iris begins to search the train with Gilbert's help. They encounter numerous peculiar characters during their search, including Dr. Hartz. His patient's face is covered with bandages, rendering the person unrecognizable. As Iris and Gilbert continue to investigate, they notice several inconsistencies with the passengers' stories and behavior, including the presence of an individual who is clearly not the wounded man Dr. Hartz claims him to be. The deeper they delve, the more they begin to suspect that the truth about Miss Froy's disappearance is linked to a high-stakes conspiracy. Eventually, Iris and Gilbert uncover evidence that Miss Froy is a British spy who has discovered a secret message. She recorded it in the form of a tune, played by the street musician shortly before his murder. Realizing that their fellow passengers are trying to prevent them from discovering the truth, Iris and Gilbert decide to confront Dr. Hartz. As they confront him, it is revealed that the patient with the bandaged face was an imposter – a decoy meant to cause confusion and help the conspirators in their mission to silence and abduct Miss Froy. With this knowledge in hand, Iris, Gilbert, and a few other allies manage to rescue Miss Froy and expose the treacherous plot. They bring the dangerous conspirators to justice before finally arriving in England, where the secret message is used for the good of their nation.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

Would particles of reactants in test A have lower or higher energy than particles in test B? John was pondering about what makes a chemical reaction faster or slower. To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top. Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

However, it is the full set of medals from the Games that he counts as his finest achievement in the sport. The Athens Olympics of 2004 yielded gold in the men's doubles with partner Nicolas Massu, and a bronze in the singles as his compatriot won that competition too -- becoming the only man to claim both titles at the same Games. \\"I got there with OPTIONS: - ATP Tour thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. - Athens Olympics thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. - CNN thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. - Chile thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. - Fernando Gonzalez thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. - Games thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. - Gonzalez thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. - Nicolas Massu thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. - Olympics thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one.","completion":"- Athens Olympics thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one.

As part of his college thesis, 18-year-old Jason Moss (Jesse Moss) decides to write to serial killers and attempt to gain their trust through impersonating a typical victim or admirer. He reasoned that gaining their trust, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.He sends a carefully crafted letter to John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe) in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable boy. The film unfolds as Gacy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through intense emotional tests via letters and collect calls, and an eventual face-to-face visit in prison.The story opens with Moss's fascination in Gacy's case as Gacy, having spent 14 years on death row, awaits the court's decision regarding his final appeal. Moss, an apt criminology student, forms a plan to \\"get inside the head\\" of Gacy, hoping to uncover new information regarding Gacy's murders and write a standout term paper on Gacy in the process.He sends Gacy his first letter, and is at first untruthful, telling him he has no girlfriend and a bad relationship with his supposedly controlling and abusive parents. He also states that his little brother, who is being bullied at school, sees him as a hero and would do anything for him. Gacy's first response is to send a questionnaire regarding Moss's personal and sex life. Moss, seeing an interview in which Gacy admits to engaging in sodomy, adopts a different tact.

Answer based on context: Coming off their season-sweeping home win over the Ravens, the Bengals flew to Heinz Field for a Week 10 AFC North rematch with the Pittsburgh Steelers with 1st place in the division on the line. Cincinnati would trail in the first quarter as Steelers kicker Jeff Reed got a 28-yard field goal. The Bengals would immediately strike back as rookie running back Bernard Scott returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Pittsburgh would retake the lead with Reed's 33-yard and 35-yard field goals. Cincinnati would regain the lead in the third quarter with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 23-yard and a 32-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers would tie the game with Reed booting a 34-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Bengals would pull away with Graham nailing a 32-yard and a 43-yard field goal. With the win, not only did the Bengals improve to 7-2, but they acquired their first season-sweep over Pittsburgh since 1998 as the Steelers fell to 6-3.

How is \\"We want all expenditure to be supported by documentary evidence, and we want all variable costs to be the subject of a cost-benefit analysis.\\" said in Romanian?","completion":"\\"Ne dorim ca toate cheltuielile să fie susținute de dovezi documentare, și ne dorim ca toate costurile variabile să fie supuse unei analize cost-beneficiu.\\" This translation conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which requests that all expenses should have documentary evidence and that all variable costs should undergo a cost-benefit analysis. However, in some contexts, the sentence might be phrased more formally or using specialized terminology. Here is a more extensive explanation of the translation: 1. \\"Ne dorim\\" (We want) - This is the expression used to show a desire or preference. It can be replaced with \\"Dorim\\" to make it less personal and more formal. 2. \\"ca toate cheltuielile să fie susținute de\\" (all expenditure to be supported by) - This part of the sentence describes the requirement for all expenses to be backed up by documentation. \\"Cheltuielile\\" means expenses or expenditures, and \\"susținute\\" means supported or backed up. 3. \\"dovezi documentare\\" (documentary evidence) - Dovezi means evidence, while documentare specifies that the evidence should be in the form of documents. This can include receipts, invoices, or any other form of written proof. 4. \\"și\\" (and) - This conjunction connects the two main ideas in the sentence. 5. \\"ca toate costurile variabile să fie supuse unei\\" (all variable costs to be the subject of) - This part of the sentence introduces the requirement for all variable costs (costurile variabile) to undergo a specific type of analysis. 6. \\"analize cost-beneficiu\\" (cost-benefit analysis) - The Romanian term for \\"cost-benefit analysis\\" is a direct translation from the English, maintaining the same meaning. It refers to the process of evaluating the potential benefits of a project or investment in comparison to the costs of undertaking that project or investment. In summary, the translated sentence captures the original intent by requesting that proper documentation is provided for all expenses and that variable costs are evaluated through a cost-benefit analysis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). and the situation: Two groups of runners attended a 5k event downtown. Brown group warmed up properly before the race, but Red group did no such thing and suffered the consequences. Answer the following question: Which group jogged slowly to warm muscles? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Brown group jogged slowly to warm up their muscles before the 5k event downtown. In the given background information, it is mentioned that warming up is crucial for preparing the muscles and tendons for an activity. A proper warm-up increases blood flow to the muscles, raises the heart rate, and reduces the risk of injuries. This is precisely what the Brown group did before the race. In contrast, the Red group neglected to warm up their muscles before participating in the 5k event. As a result, they suffered the consequences of not warming up properly. It's important to note that even elite athletes require a suitable warm-up routine before engaging in any sport or physical activity, as it helps optimize their performance and reduces the risk of injuries.

Public Policy Polling measures her statewide approval rating at just 34 percent, with 57 percent of voters viewing her negatively. A hypothetical challenge to Sen. Amy Klobuchar looks like a daunting endeavor. Bachmann would begin a Senate race at a 23-point deficit to the first-term Democrat. Part of that margin stems from Klobuchar's strength; her approval rating sits at 61 percent. Just thirty-seven percent of Minnesotans believe Bachmann should run for a fourth term -- and there's a striking gender gap on that question. Just 29 percent of women think Bachmann should seek reelection compared to 45 percent of men. Bachmann hasn't commented on her 2012 plans but recently told a reporter she'd give interviews soon on the subject. And she isn't the only one who has been tarnished by White House aspirations. Former presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty is also upside down in Minnesota five months following the end of his campaign, with a net negative favorability rating, 39 percent to 50 percent.

Michele Bachmann (R) said she would run for a fourth term, but then quickly qualified her response in an interview Wednesday. Speaking on Fox News, Bachmann seemed caught off guard when asked directly if she’d be running for a fourth term. “I, very — yes,” she said. “I believe I’ll be looking at that, very seriously looking at coming back for a fourth term.” After a brief surge early in the GOP presidential race capped by her win in the Ames Straw Poll, Bachmann pulled out earlier this month following a sixth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. The contentious nature of the primary season, coupled with some high-profile missteps, sent her back to Minnesota with a low favorability rating in her home state. According to a statewide Public Policy Polling survey released on Tuesday, only 34 percent of those polled have a positive view of her, while 57 percent have an unfavorable view. Only 37 percent said she should run for reelection. “It’s very important right now that we have a Congress and a president who understands the depth of the spending trouble that we have, the debt problem that we have,” Bachmann continued. “We need people who are committed to repealing ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank, and that’s what I’ve been talking about on the presidential campaign trail, but we need that strong voice here in Washington to remain.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Michele Bachmann, who recently withdrew from the presidential race, is considering running for a fourth term as a Minnesota Representative.

During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'.

With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques.

Rachel, for her part, resents the attention her sister's drug addiction is drawing away from her wedding, a resentment that comes to a head at the rehearsal dinner, where Kym, amid toasts from friends and family, takes the microphone to offer an apology for her past actions, as part of her twelve-step program. Underlying the family's dynamic is a tragedy that occurred years previously, which Kym retells at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. As a teenager, Kym was responsible for the death of her younger brother Ethan, who was left in her care one day; driving home from a nearby park, an intoxicated Kym had lost control of the car, driving over a bridge and into a lake, where her brother drowned.

Answer:","completion":"No, I can't directly answer the question about Kym's mother's name as it is not mentioned within the provided movie plot summary. However, I can provide some guidance about investing in the film proposal based on the details you have given. The movie, \\"Rachel Getting Married,\\" directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Jenny Lumet, presents a compelling storyline that delves into the complexities of familial relationships, addiction, and facing past traumas. Anne Hathaway, who stars as Kym, is an acclaimed Hollywood actress who has garnered significant recognition for her work, which could suggest the potential for a strong performance in the film. Considering the powerful themes and strong cast, it is possible that this film proposal could generate interest from audiences and film critics. The themes of addiction, forgiveness, and family dynamics are universal issues that many viewers can relate to and may resonate emotionally with the audience. Additionally, the inclusion of a wedding as the backdrop for the story can provide a balance of light and dark elements, further enhancing the film's appeal to different demographics. When assessing whether to invest in a film proposal, it is essential to consider several factors such as the marketability, story, target audience, production budget, and revenue projections. Based on the information provided, it seems that \\"Rachel Getting Married\\" has the potential to be successful on a variety of levels. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that the film has already been produced and released in 2008. It has received generally positive reviews and garnered award nominations for Anne Hathaway's performance. Consequently, investing in this specific film may not be feasible since it has already been made. However, if the proposal is a remake or adaptation of this story, it is still crucial to take the above factors into account. It may also be valuable to evaluate the success of the original film and determine if there are specific reasons for remaking or adapting it that would result in a profitable venture. In conclusion, while I am unable to answer the question about Kym's mother's name, other aspects of the film plot, themes, and cast suggest that \\"Rachel Getting Married\\" could have been an appealing investment opportunity at the time of its initial production. If this is a proposal for a remake or adaptation, carefully consider the reasons for revisiting this story and assess market trends and audience preferences to determine whether it could be a worthwhile investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, it is not possible to confirm or refute the hypothesis that a lot of people got to climb the mountain. However, we can attempt to infer the possibility of people climbing the mountain based on the facts provided. Lausche, being the highest peak of the Lusatian Mountains and in the German part of the Upper Lusatia region, might attract hikers, climbers, and tourists who are interested in scaling the highest points of these locations.

However, we can analyze possible factors and reasons that could contribute to the premise and how it may relate to the hypothesis. To begin with, the observed increase in individuals speaking out for their rights could be influenced by various social and technological factors. Advancements in communication technologies have transformed how information is disseminated and consumed by the public. Social media platforms, for instance, enable individuals to share their experiences, opinions, and beliefs with a broader audience, effectively providing them a platform to assert their rights. This ease of communication may facilitate a greater number of individuals expressing their concerns about their rights. However, this does not necessarily mean that collective actions or group representation has diminished or become less effective in advocating for rights. Another factor could be the growing awareness and emphasis on individual rights and freedoms in contemporary society. As people become more educated about their rights and the importance of standing up against injustices, they may feel empowered to express their grievances individually. This development could also potentially contribute to the observed shift in individuals advocating for their rights, as opposed to working together in groups. That being said, while there might be a trend of individuals advocating for their rights, it doesn't necessarily imply that group-oriented advocacy is losing importance or effectiveness. Collective efforts like social movements, labor unions, and non-governmental organizations have historically been essential in achieving progress in various aspects of human rights and social justice. These groups often comprise individuals working together towards a shared goal, and their collective efforts can amplify the impact of advocating for rights. In summary, while it may appear that there is a growing trend of individuals speaking out for their rights, it is not possible to tell definitively if this observation entails the hypothesis \\"more people are asserting their rights as individuals rather than as groups\\" without more information and a more comprehensive analysis. It is crucial to consider the context, as well as the possible implications and constraints that may arise from both individual and collective advocacy efforts. There is power in both individual and group advocacy; they can complement one another and contribute to fostering positive change for human rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who considered himself a true Parisian?, what is it ?

This will allow for an informed decision to be made on the optimal saffron preparation technique. Method 1: Soaking saffron in warm milk 1. Take a small pinch of saffron strands (about 10-15 strands). 2. Soak the saffron strands in 2-3 tablespoons of warm milk for at least 10-15 minutes. This allows the saffron to release its color, aroma, and flavor into the milk. 3. After soaking, add the saffron-infused milk to the kheer and mix well. Advantages: - Easy process with minimal steps. - Allows for optimal release of saffron's properties into the milk. - Adds a rich, beautiful color to the kheer. Disadvantages: - Requires some additional time for soaking. Method 2: Crushing saffron and adding it directly to kheer 1. Take a small pinch of saffron strands (about 10-15 strands). 2. Crush the saffron strands with your fingers or a mortar and pestle. 3. Sprinkle the crushed saffron directly into the kheer while it's cooking and mix well. Advantages: - A quicker method as it doesn't involve soaking. - Adds a subtle saffron flavor to the kheer. Disadvantages: - Does not release saffron's properties as effectively as soaking. - Aroma, flavor, and color may not be as vibrant as with the soaking method. Based on the comparison, the better solution for preparing saffron when making kheer is Method 1: Soaking saffron in warm milk. Though it requires additional soaking time, it ensures a richer color, aroma, and flavor infusion in the kheer, resulting in a more delicious and authentic dessert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given Adam stops swinging the bucket, will its centripetal acceleration increase or decrease? Adam wants to show his little brother a trick. He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle. Hint: Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain. The answer is:","completion":"The centripetal acceleration will decrease if Adam stops swinging the bucket. When Adam is swinging the bucket in a circle, the centripetal force keeps the water inside the bucket due to the continuous acceleration towards the center of the circle. This centripetal force is created by Adam's hand pulling on the handle and transmitted through the bucket. The centripetal acceleration is directly proportional to the square of the object's velocity and inversely proportional to the radius of the circle. As the bucket's velocity decreases when Adam stops swinging it, the centripetal acceleration will decrease as well."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: One result of air pollution is acid rain.

Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \\"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\\" Liu said. People caught smoking in forbidden areas will be fined 10 yuan (1.40), while enterprises and institutions that violate the ban will face fines of between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Smoking was forbidden in hospitals, kindergartens, schools, museums, sports venues and other places before the new regulations took effect. From Oct 1 last year, the city also banned smoking in its 66,000 cabs, and imposed fines of 100 yuan to 200 yuan on drivers caught smoking in taxis.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article that answers the following question: Which was the largest size in the 2010 census: average household size or average family size?","completion":"Title: Largest Size in the 2010 Census: Average Household Size vs. Average Family Size Hello little friends! Today, we will talk about the 2010 census that happens in the United States. Do you know what a census is? A census is a big count of all the people living in a country, and it helps us learn more about them. It helps us find out how many people live in a household or a family. So, let's discover which one was bigger - average household size or average family size! First, let's understand what we mean by households and families. A \\"household\\" includes all the people who live together in one house or apartment. They can be related or not. For example, a household can have a mom, a dad, a child, a family friend, or even a roommate. On the other hand, a \\"family\\" is a group of people who are related, like parents and children, grandparents, or siblings. So, families are a part of households, but households can include more than just families. Now that we know the difference between households and families, let's find out which was larger in the 2010 census! It turns out, in 2010, the average household size in the United States was 2.58 people per household. That means, on average, about 2 or 3 people lived together in each home. What about families? In the same year, the average family size in the United States was 3.14 people per family. That means, on average, about 3 people lived together in each family. So, which one was bigger? In the 2010 census, the average family size (3.14 people) was larger than the average household size (2.58 people). Families had more people living together because they're usually made up of parents and children or other relatives. In conclusion, with the help of the 2010 census, we learned about how people live in the United States. Families, which have a bigger size, stay together with their close relatives. Households can have different people living together who are not necessarily family members. Did you know about that before? Now you can tell your friends and family something new you learned today!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: Alcohol increases the tendency for risky driving in some individuals but not others. Little is known about the factors underlying this individual difference. Studies find that those who underestimate their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) following a dose of alcohol tend to be more impulsive and report greater willingness to drive after drinking than those who estimate their BACs to be greater than their actual BAC. BAC underestimation could contribute to risky driving behavior following alcohol as such drivers might perceive little impairment in their driving ability and thus no need for caution.', \\"This study was designed to test the relationship between drivers' BAC estimations following a dose of alcohol or a placebo and the degree of risky driving they displayed during a simulated driving test.\\", 'Forty adult drivers performed a simulated driving test and estimated their blood alcohol concentration after receiving a dose of alcohol (0.65 g/kg for men and 0.56 g/kg for women) or a placebo.', 'Alcohol increased risk-taking and impaired driving skill.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Astronauts, people who fly into space, need special training. First they go to Houston, Texas. That is the home of the Johnson Space Centre. There they are tested to see how strong and smart they are. One of the first tests is for the heart. The people walk or run, then the space doctors see how fast their hearts are beating. Another important test is performed. In this test the person must curl his body up in a ball. When he is in that position, he is put into a round cloth bag. The doctors give him no idea how long he will have to stay in the bag. If a spaceship broke down in space, the astronauts would get into bags like this. Then they would have to wait and curl up in darkness, until help could arrive. You can see that an astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness. After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. The astronauts in training learn many other things. They learn how to jump out of a moving airplane. They learn to how to blow up a lifeboat and get into it while they are in the ocean. The astronauts also have to learn how to get lifted out of the ocean by helicopter . That may look fun, but it can be dangerous. After they finish training, the astronauts continue to work. They stay in good shape by running and doing exercise. They read about their special jobs. In that way they can learn new facts about space travel. Then the big day comes.

Rest in peace: Heartbroken Katherine Jenkins paid tribute to her best friend Polly Noble(L) after she passed away following a eight year battle with cervical cancer. Brave: Polly was first diagnosed with cancer at 24, then again at 28, fighting it for eight years until her tragic death. From the day she was diagnosed, Miss Noble had worked to 'cure herself' through positive thinking and healthy living. Her mother Georgie Noble, 63, said today: 'She. was a beautiful, vivacious person who worked hard to put her message. across. I don't. think she realised just how many people's lives she touched.' Speaking of her last days, Mr Noble added: 'It got to the stage a couple of weeks ago where they said the chemo isn't working. - Polly Noble's 'mission statement' written after she was diagnosed with cancer. 'A. scan showed she had six tumours in her liver, one being 7cm wide and. she didn't have those in December. It was such a shock, we didn't. realise she had it that badly.' She. died on Sunday surrounded by her family, who said she was pleased to. have met her nine-week-old nephew, Freddie, before she passed away. 'In her last few days she was unable to. catch up on the sleep she desperately needed. The illness had taken its. toll and sadly she passed away later that afternoon at home,' her mother added. One of Miss Noble's final messages on Twitter included the Winston. Churchill quote: ‘Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage. to continue that counts.' Polly was treated for cervical cancer in 2005 and revealed the diagnosis to her best friend Katherine Jenkins over the phone while she was on tour. The. pair had become close after meeting as struggling singers in 2001 and. Katherine always maintained Polly was. the ‘true star’, not her. After initial treatment of her cancer in 2005, she discovered a lump on her neck in 2010 and, despite undergoing radiotherapy to treat that, she then discovered she had cancerous cells in her lungs. Friends: Miss Noble and Katherine together last year. Katherine said of her friend: 'Polly has never had a \\"poor me\\" mentality. She's fought her cancer head-on, completely overhauling her diet and lifestyle' Close: Speaking of their friendship, Miss Noble said: 'We are both ambitious and driven, but at the same time we're chilled. That is why we understand what makes each other tick' Final messages: Polly wrote on Facebook and Twitter last week that showing 'courage to continue' in adversity was more important than success or failure. Message: Friend Gethin Jones, the former boyfriend of Katherine Jenkins, paid tribute to 'beautiful' and 'inspirational' Polly. Much loved: Sports presenter Jake Humphrey spoke of how Polly had continued to inspire others, even in her final days. Katherine went online to pay. tribute to Miss Noble yesterday, posting a picture of herself and Polly. with the caption: ‘Heartbroken. Rest in Peace my darling friend’. Speaking to You Magazine last year, Katherine said: ‘She didn’t look or sound ill – it was just unbelievable. 'And of course the word cancer frightens the life out of me because I had watched my father die of lung cancer when I was 15'. She added: ‘But he had been nearly 70, and Polly was just 24. She was too young; she had too much to live for.’ Jenkins' former boyfriend Gethin Jones tweeted: 'Reading beautiful messages. about the inspirational @Pollynoble. She touched so many. Grateful to. have spent some wonderful times with her'. But. the cancer diagnosis meant her 'life turned upside down' and after. surviving several long stays in hospital, where three litres of water. were drained from her chest, and she suffered a major blood clot, she. wanted to 'cure herself' of cancer. She. wrote on her blog: 'Throughout all of it, I have been able to maintain a. positive outlook, belief and faith that I will overcome cancer, once. and for all. In fact, I do it everyday as an active participant in my. healing journey. Girls day out: Polly and Katherine, who met before the singer became famous, at a polo match in 2010. Family fun: Katherine (top) and Polly (right) with friends and family during a trip to the park. 'This. means that I live consciously in all areas of my life, creating a. balanced and healthy existence, which allows me to move forward and live. my dream life, despite living with cancer. 'When. I got ill, I wished I had taken better care of myself. I wished I had. known more about the things in everyday life that were harming me'. Katherine Jenkins was there to support her friend as she went through surgery before having chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Initally, the treatment worked and Polly was able to move back to London where she lived cancer free for three years. However, in 2010, she found a lump in her neck that turned out to be a secondary tumour. Katherine. recalled the moment she found out as she said: ‘This time her. oncologist told her that although she could have more treatment, the. cancer was ultimately incurable. ‘She called me from the hospital with the news. Neither of us cried. We were too stunned.’ Miss Noble. co-authored a book, The Cancer Journey, which was published in 2011,. giving advice for others on how to cope with the disease. Determined. to live life to the full, she also posted a touching video on. YouTube in 2012 of all the things she had done that year. Speaking last year, Miss Noble said: 'I lost my long dark hair as a result of my treatment, and normally, when I go out or have my picture taken, I reach for one of my wigs. But Katherine has been telling me that I am gorgeous just as I am' Best friends: The singer posted a picture of herself and her friend on Twitter on Monday with the caption, 'Heartbroken. Rest in Peace my darling friend' Party girls: Katherine and Polly together in 2012, after Katherine wrote the foreword to a book co-authored by her friend. The. video told of her holiday in Dubai with Katherine, a trip to Brazil and. her joy at being an Olympic torch-bearer in Bexley, south east London. But. the short film also documented her continued treatment for cancer,. describing how she needed three litres of fluid drained from her chest. and how she bought a pink wig after undergoing chemotherapy. Below the video, she posted the message: 'No matter what challenges you face, you can overcome them, I promise.' Katherine was inspired by her best friend’s strength as she said: ‘Polly has turned her own experiences into an incredibly positive force. 'The book she has co-written on coping with cancer is just what I wish I had been able to turn to when my father became ill. 'She has also trained as a holistic health coach, become a nutrition guru and developed her own website on healthy living.’ Katherine shared another picture of the pair on Instagram with the caption: 'Heartbroken - Sleep now with the angels'. *Polly backed the YES TO LIFE charity, which supports people with the disease by combining both alternative medicine and standard treatments. Inspirational: After being diagnosed with the disease, Miss Noble dedicated her life to helping others in a similar situation. For you dad: Katherine Jenkins ran the 2013 Virgin London Marathon in honour of her father, who also passed away following his battle with cancer. Cervical cancer is a rare form of cancer that develops at the entrance to the womb. It is most common in sexually active women aged between 25 and 45 but because of routine screening in the UK it is usually picked up in the pre-cancerous stage. It often has no symptoms in the early stages but the most common symptom is unusual bleeding, especially after sex or between periods. It is recommended that all women between the ages of 25 and 49 are screened for cervical cancer every three years. The NHS scrapped routine smears for under-25s in 2003 over concerns they could do more harm than good. But the family of aspiring model Sophie Jones (right), who died of the disease after after being refused a smear test - say they should be given to all young women who have symptoms, regardless of age. Sophie, 19, was told she was too young to have a smear test when she complained of crippling stomach pains last February. Her family's campaign – Sophie’s Choice – is backed by MPs and 225,000 signatures and calls for the minimum age for automatic tests to be cut to 16. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'The issue was last debated in Parliament in 2009, but the best independent evidence still shows that routine screening of women under 25 does more harm than good. ‘Cervical cancer in women under 25s is extremely rare. In 2011, there were 47 cases of cervical cancer in women under 25 and no deaths.' Of all of the women with cervical cancer, about 83 per cent live for at least a year after diagnosis, 67 per cent live for at least five years and 63 per cent live for at least 10 years.

There are many people from all walks of life in the audience; a blind man and his guide daughter; an elderly married couple; a boyfriend and girlfriend; and a pimp named Tony along with his two prostitutes, who look at the theater's display props in the foyer. One of the prostitutes, Rosemary, scratches her face with a bizarre display mask before they go in to watch the film. The film is a violent, disturbing horror movie which features a look-alike of the mask from the lobby. It is about four teenagers who discover an old tomb and dig up the grave of a sixteenth-century fortune teller called Nostradamus. When the teenagers dig up Nostradamus's coffin they find no body, just an old book and a mask identical to the strange mask in the foyer. When one of the characters puts the mask on he's scratched by it just like Rosemary was by its doppelganger. A moment later, he turns evil and slaughters his friends with a knife. Rosemary feels ill and goes to the bathroom, where the scratch on her face bursts open, spewing out pus. She is soon transformed into a bloodthirsty, green-skinned, red-eyed, fanged demon like the one in the film. Rosemary attacks her friend, Carmen, who then rips through the screen and transforms into a demon in front of the rest of the cinema-goers. The group of uninfected people race to any exit they can find, only to find that they have all been bricked up making escape impossible.

Given the question: Longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies. High frequency bass notes have what length wavelengths long or short? The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's first analyze the information provided: 1. Longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies. 2. Shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies. 3. High frequency bass notes have what length wavelengths - long or short? Now, let's break down the information step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the relationship between wavelengths and frequencies. The information states that longer wavelengths correspond to lower frequencies, while shorter wavelengths correspond to higher frequencies. Step 2: Determine the characteristic of bass notes. Bass notes are typically low-pitched sounds, which means they have lower frequencies. Step 3: Apply the relationship between wavelengths and frequencies to bass notes. Since bass notes have lower frequencies, we need to find which type of wavelength, long or short, corresponds to lower frequencies. Step 4: Find the correct match for bass notes. Referring back to the first piece of information, we see that longer wavelengths correspond to lower frequencies. Therefore, the answer is: High frequency bass notes have long wavelengths. However, it is important to note that bass notes are typically associated with low frequencies, so referring to them as \\"high frequency bass notes\\" may be confusing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While food trucks seem to be enlivening the Districtâs dining scene, the author says: âI confess I find mobile dining an uncomfortable way to eat, and I know it is a very hard way to make a living. We donât know whether food trucks are going to be a fixture in this or any other city.â In mid-May, my Friday produce didnât arrive from the Oasis co-op, a group of 30 small farms in Lancaster County, Pa. It was an Amish holiday and my delivery was postponed, so I went to a Whole Foods store. When I reached the fruits and vegetables, I found: corn from Florida with wilted husks. âHeirloomâ tomatoes from Canada â a summer fruit grown for Whole Foods during the Canadian winter â offered at 5 a pound. Three-dollar artichokes (each). Apples, last yearâs crop from Washington state, at 2.50 a pound. Pears from Argentina hard as rocks. Mexican blackberries. Is this the best we have in Washington? I went two days later to the Dupont Circle farmers market. I want earnestly to support this, my neighborhood outdoor market. And I think farmers markets have made a big contribution here, increasing availability of good produce. But salad greens at 11 a pound? Rhubarb at 6 a pound? A small bunch of ramps for 6? When I moved here in 1961, people said the best cooking in Washington was found in embassy residences and peopleâs homes. At that time we had a few specialty stores such as the French Market in Georgetown, no farmers markets, and 80 percent of the groceries sold here came from two behemoths, Safeway and Giant Food. Read the rest of the Food Issue, including an article about the local beer scene and food critic Tom Sietsemaâs dinner party tips, by visiting WP Magazine. But ingredients in the Eastern Market and the then-existing Western Market were as good as those in any other city. Our restaurants werenât so wonderful, but in 1961 that was true virtually everywhere else, too. A half a century later, much has changed. Or so we are told. I read paeans to Washingtonâs food early this year in the national press as it turned its collective attention to the presidential inauguration. Food & Wine magazine wrote hyperbolically about âinnovative restaurants that are keeping this early-to-bed town up way too late for a 6 a.m. power breakfast.â A lot of sophisticated eaters say Washington is now a âworld-classâ food city, whatever that means. When they say that, they generally are talking about our restaurants; and we have many good restaurants. We even have a number of excellent ones. Central Michel Richard, CitiZen, Palena, Obelisk, Vidalia all come to mind. But I have lived here for 52 years, and food has been my hobby all that time. In 1990 I turned that hobby into a career and opened Marvelous Market. In 1997 I started the Breadline, a downtown bakery and restaurant (I donât own either of them now). I am not nearly as encouraged as others. I do not believe that we have the elements of a really wonderful food culture. Peter McNamara serves customers at Righteous Cheese inside Union Market, which the author calls âpromising.â A variety of cheeses offered at Righteous Cheese. The author bemoans that Washington doesnât have âa great cheese store, like Murrayâs in New York.â Great food cities are ones with a discernible tradition, ones that have good grocery stores and markets; many small stores run by people with single-minded devotion to food craft â to charcuterie, coffee, bread, cheese and ice cream â and relatively easy access to really good produce and other ingredients. Great food cities have restaurants offering varied cuisines at varied price levels, neighborhood restaurants and special-occasion restaurants. They have chefs committed to their cities and focused on their restaurants, and â most important â a sophisticated and demanding clientele intolerant of bad service and bad food. My criteria for great food cities donât include bars presided over by âmixologists,â a gussied-up term for bartender created to justify an 18 cocktail (22 at Rye Bar, 25 at Barmini). My criteria do not include âcutting edgeâ chefs who play with the molecules of food, or made-for-television celebrity chefs. Nor do they include âpower restaurants,â important here but in few other cities and to few customers. Indeed, my criteria go well beyond restaurants.

Translate to English","completion":"The fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights are now only mentioned in the preamble. The European Charter of Fundamental Rights is a document that sets out a comprehensive range of civil, political, economic, and social rights for citizens and residents of the European Union (EU). Since coming into force in 2009, the Charter has served as a reference within the EU to uphold fundamental rights and freedoms as well as to guide the implementation of EU legislation, policies, and actions. The rights cherished by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights are instilled in the charter's preamble and span across six chapters. These chapters encompass Dignity, Freedoms, Equality, Solidarity, Citizens' rights, and Justice. They outline the essential human rights that should be nurtured and protected, allowing for the creation and sustenance of a fair and democratic society within the EU. The preamble of the Charter serves as a vital introduction to the values and principles enshrined within the document. While it does not contain specific legal provisions, it does establish a general background for interpreting the rights laid out in the Charter. The preamble sets the tone, emphasizing the protection of human dignity, the importance of pluralism and diversity, the respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, and promoting social justice and cohesion. It also expresses the EU's commitment to guaranteeing the rights it espouses and to acting in a manner that respects the Charter's principles. Significantly, as a vital legal instrument for the European Union, the Charter has a binding effect on all EU institutions and national authorities when implementing EU law. This means that both the European Court of Justice and national courts may rely upon the Charter when examining cases pertaining to fundamental rights issues. Consequently, the rights set forth in the Charter, while initially only mentioned in the preamble, permeate throughout the entirety of the document, thus ensuring their applicability and enforcement across the EU member states. In conclusion, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is a landmark document that enumerates, strengthens, and guarantees essential rights to all citizens and residents of the European Union. Although the fundamental rights are initially mentioned in the preamble, they are further elaborated upon and brought to fruition throughout the Charter's six distinct chapters. These rights, in effect, shape the foundation of European identity and promote the vision of a prosperous and inclusive society adhering to democratic values."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the app serves a specific function or aims to solve a particular problem, it would be useful to know if it fulfills its intended purpose effectively and efficiently. 2. Are there any unique or standout features? Knowing what sets the app apart from competitors can help determine whether it is worth recommending to a friend. If the app boasts innovative or superior features, it may be more likely to receive a \\"Yes\\" or \\"Definitely\\" recommendation. 3. What is the overall user experience? Beyond just the review stating \\"Cool,\\" it is important to understand the user experience in terms of ease of use, reliability, and satisfaction. If the majority of the users find the app enjoyable and easy to navigate, the likelihood of a positive recommendation increases. 4. Are there any notable drawbacks or limitations? Understanding any potential downsides or issues with the app can help determine whether these factors would outweigh the positive aspects, potentially leading to a \\"Maybe,\\" \\"No,\\" or \\"Not at all\\" recommendation. 5. How do other users rate and review the app? While a single review stating \\"Cool\\" does not provide much information, analyzing multiple ratings and reviews can offer a broader perspective on the app's overall performance and user satisfaction.

First, we will break down the two statements and analyze the details provided in each: 1. \\"A girl dressed in red is walking down the street with two men on stilts behind her and a crowd of people walking in the background.\\" - The girl is dressed in red - The girl is walking down the street - There are two men on stilts behind her - There is a crowd of people walking in the background 2. \\"Two men wearing stilts are following their sister to school.\\" - There are two men, and they are wearing stilts - The two men are following their sister - Their sister is going to school Now, let's compare the details in both statements: - Two men on stilts: This detail is present in both statements, so it is reasonable to assume that the two men on stilts are the same in both scenarios. - A girl: Statement 1 mentions the girl's clothing, while statement 2 mentions her relationship with the stilt-wearing men as their sister. There isn't any information that contradicts each other, but we do not have enough evidence to definitively say they are the same girl. - Walking down the street / Going to school: The girl's destination in statement 2 is school, which could involve walking down the street. These two pieces of information are plausible but not explicitly linked. - A crowd of people walking in the background: This detail was only mentioned in statement 1 and does not have any corresponding information in statement 2. Based on the analysis above, there is not sufficient information to conclusively state that \\"A girl dressed in red is walking down the street with two men on stilts behind her and a crowd of people walking in the background\\", given the information that \\"Two men wearing stilts are following their sister to school\\". However, making some assumptions can allow us to draw possible connections between the two scenarios: A. If we assume that the girl in statement 1 is the sister referenced in statement 2, then it is plausible that she is dressed in red and going to school. B. If we assume that the crowd of people in the background in statement 1 are merely a part of the daily morning rush to school and work, it is plausible that the second statement takes place within the context of the first statement. In conclusion, while it is tempting to connect these two statements, it is important to note that without any clear evidence, their connection remains speculative at best. Sufficient evidence is necessary to make conclusive connections between two scenarios, and in this particular case, we do not have enough information to firmly connect these two scenes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact sharks come in all shapes, sizes and even colors! Follow me please; I'd like to show you a very special small shark commonly known as horn sharks, only found in the coastal waters of north-west North America. Look at this shark, and you can easily see the horns on it and you will know the reason why it is called the horn shark is that it has the broad, flattened head and two large horn-like spines found behind its eyes and makes it one of the hardiest of all shark species. What makes it unique is that as its enemy attempts to swallow it, the spines on its back will stick into the enemy's mouth and give a good chance for it to get away. The horn shark is brown in color with black spots all over its body. The adults can reach up to a length of 4 feet and weigh up to 10 kg. An interesting fact about the horn shark is that it has five gills . The horn shark is a clumsy swimmer using its flexible pectoral fins to push itself along the bottom of the ocean. The maximum distance that has ever been recorded for a horn shark to have traveled out from its habitat is 10 miles. Today, as so little is known about its population off the Californian coast, they have been listed as being \\"Data Deficient\\" in the World Conservation Union.

Write a title for this article: IRBIL, Iraq — Kurdish forces in Iraq are investigating two other possible chemical weapons attacks by the Islamic State group, a top official said Monday, as authorities put an Iraqi offensive to retake Saddam Hussein’s hometown on hold. The two purported chemical weapon attacks resemble one claimed Saturday by Kurdish officials who say an independent laboratory concluded the militants used chlorine gas against its peshmerga forces in a Jan. 23 truck suicide attack. However, their claims were not immediately verified by international authorities. Iraqi officials and Kurds fighting in Syria have made similar allegations about the militants using the low-grade chemical weapons against them. The Islamic State group, which controls a third of Syria and Iraq in its self-declared caliphate, has not commented on the claims. Gen. Aziz Wesi, in charge of a Kurdish special forces brigade, told journalists Monday that authorities declined to immediately discuss the two newly announced attacks when they happened on Dec. 26 and Jan. 28 out of fears of causing a panic. Kurdish officials have offered footage of the aftermath of the Dec. 26 attack, which shows men coughing and pouring water over their heads after another suicide truck bombing that authorities say wounded some 60 men. “I put a wet scarf on my face because when I saw the gas, I felt it,” said Capt. Mohammad Sewdin, who leads the Kurdish special forces unit targeted in the December attack. “I was afraid it might be something like (chemical weapons). So I told my men to do the same.” Sewdin told The Associated Press he was temporarily blinded for six hours after the attack and coughed up blood. He and others were hospitalized. On Saturday, the Kurdistan Region Security Council offered video and lab results it said proved the Islamic State group used chlorine in the Jan. 23 suicide truck bomb. There has been no independent confirmation of any of the Kurds’ claim. Peter Sawczak, a spokesman for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which has monitored Syria dismantling its chemical weapons stockpile, said Saturday that his group had not been asked to investigate the Jan. 23 attack. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday about the newly claimed attacks. Chlorine, an industrial chemical, was first introduced as a chemical weapon at Ypres in World War I with disastrous effects as gas masks were not widely available at the time. While chlorine has many industrial and public uses, as a weapon it chokes victims to death. Most nations banned its use in war in the Geneva Protocol of 1925. In the Syrian civil war, a chlorine gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus in 2013 killed hundreds and nearly drove the U.S. to launch airstrikes against the government of embattled President Bashar Assad. The U.S. and Western allies accused Assad’s government of being responsible for that attack, while Damascus blamed rebels. There have been several allegations that the Islamic State group has used chlorine previously. In October, Iraqi officials claimed Islamic State militants may have used chlorine-filled cylinders during clashes in late September in the towns of Balad and Duluiya. Their disclosures came as reports from the Syrian border town of Kobani indicated that the extremist group added chlorine to an arsenal that already includes heavy weapons and tanks looted from captured military bases. Insurgents have used chlorine gas in Iraq before. In May 2007, suicide bombers driving chlorine tankers struck three cities in Anbar province, killing two police officers and forcing about 350 Iraqi civilians and six U.S. troops to seek treatment for gas exposure. Those bombers belonged to al-Qaida in Iraq, which later became the Islamic State group. The Kurdish claims also come on the 27th anniversary Monday of the 1988 Halabja massacre, which saw Saddam use chemical weapons on the Kurdish village, killing an estimated 5,000 people. Meanwhile Monday, Iraqi Interior Minister Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban said the offensive to retake the Islamic State-held city of Tikrit will be on hold until civilians in Saddam Hussein’s hometown can flee and roadside bombs can be cleared. Speaking to reporters from the nearby city of Samarra, he said Islamic State militants booby-trapped roads and buildings leading into Tikrit, slowing the Iraqi forces, aided by Iranian advisers. “The militants are squeezed into a small part of the city center,” al-Ghabban said. He offered no timeframe for the advance to resume, saying that is being “left to the field commanders.” So far, the campaign is not being aided by U.S.-led airstrikes, which continue in elsewhere in Iraq and Syria. Tikrit, the capital of Salahuddin province, lies about 80 miles north of Baghdad. It is one of the largest cities held by Islamic State militants and lies on the road connecting Baghdad to Mosul. Retaking it will help Iraqi forces have a major supply link for any future operation to retake Mosul. U.S. military officials have that said a coordinated military mission to retake Mosul likely will begin in April or May and involve up to 25,000 Iraqi troops. But the Americans have cautioned that if the Iraqis are not ready, the offensive could be delayed. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO.

This is unrelated to the context, Davies is not part of the Australian team. - Conrad Smith.' and 'Sonny Bill Williams.' are players in the opposing team. - Da Vinci Code.' relates to the analogy made in the text, it's a book, not a rugby team. - Davies.’ This would imply that Davies is focusing on himself, which would be an awkward and unlikely completion to the sentence. - Fiji.' This is another team that is unrelated to his participation. - Glamorgan.' is the location of the team announcement but is not the most logical completion as it's an area, not a team. - Jonathan Davies.’ This would be a repetition and doesn't fit in the context of the sentence. - Millennium Stadium.'

As with the 'All Blacks', this refers to the opposing team. - Vale.’ This refers to the location Vale of Glamorgan, not the team he's focusing on. - Warren Gatland.’ Although this could potentially make sense, as Gatland is the head coach of Wales, the context implies Davies is speaking about his dedication to the team itself, not specifically the coach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The boiling point of water is lower at higher altitudes due to the decreased atmospheric pressure. High-altitude cooking requires a compensation for lower temperatures for any cooking that involves boiling or steaming. This effect starts to become relevant at altitudes above 2,000 feet (610 m). Means of compensation include boiling/steaming for longer times or using a pressure cooker to provide higher pressure inside the cooking vessel, and hence higher temperature. does water boil at different temperatures at different altitudes? Choose from: *no; *yes;","completion":"Yes, water boils at different temperatures at different altitudes due to the changes in atmospheric pressure. When the atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of water also decreases. At sea level, water boils at 100°C (212°F) under normal atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.3 kPa). However, as you go higher in altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes lower, causing water to boil at lower temperatures. This is because the reduced pressure allows the water molecules to vaporize more easily, which means that they require less heat energy to transform from liquid to gas. In turn, this leads to a reduced boiling point. The relationship between altitude and boiling point is not linear, but some typical boiling points at different altitudes include: - At 1,000 feet (305 m) above sea level, the boiling point of water is approximately 99°C (210°F). - At 5,000 feet (1,524 m) above sea level, the boiling point of water is approximately 95°C (203°F). - At 10,000 feet (3,048 m) above sea level, the boiling point of water is approximately 90°C (194°F). As mentioned in the given information, high-altitude cooking requires adjusting cooking times or using specialized equipment, such as pressure cookers, to compensate for the reduced boiling or steaming temperatures. This is important in ensuring that your food is cooked properly and reaches the required internal temperature for safety and taste. Additionally, the lower boiling point at higher altitudes can affect other aspects of cooking and baking, such as the need for increased cooking time for pasta or adjusting ingredient ratios in baked goods. In some cases, it is recommended to use high-altitude specific recipes or guidelines to achieve the desired results in your cooking and baking endeavors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson). Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch.In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary.Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam. Because Sturgess' soul was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or any other vampire (since \\"Only the living can kill the dead\\").

Many traps are designed to catch a rat or mouse using bait and a trap door. These are often the safest types of traps for catching your pet rat. Only purchase traps that state “humane” or “live trap” on the packaging. Some traps advertise that they are “humane killing” traps because they don't cause pest mice to suffer. Make sure the trap you choose specifies that it keeps the rat caught alive. The Havahart mousetrap (commonly called the “have a heart” mouse trap”) is unique because it is open on either side, allowing your rat to enter the trap from more than one direction. These traps are made of wire mesh and are designed to be safe for you and your pet rat. Position the bait in the center of the mouse trap so it will have to enter the trap completely from either side in order to get to it. These traps are reusable and offer enough room inside for your rat to move around until you find it. When placing your bait in this trap, it helps to add a small dab of peanut butter in the center, then place candy or treats in the peanut butter. This will prevent your bait from moving away from the center of the cage. The Smart Mouse Trap is among the most aesthetically pleasing traps on the market because it looks like a small green house for your rat! It is also recommended by humane societies and animal rights organizations all over the world. This trap involves using bait your rat won't actually get access to (it's inside a plastic container) so you will need to use strong smelling bait like bacon bits or strong smelling cheese. This trap works by using a steel spring to shut the plastic door on the house after your rat enters the trap. You may want to include some bait inside the trap itself so your rat has something to eat while it waits for you to come back. If you have a treat you often give your pet rat, use that as the bait in your store bought rat trap. The smell of treats may lure your rat out into the open and to the trap and you are most likely to catch your pet rat with bait you know it likes. Other options for bait include: Peanut Butter Bacon Oatmeal Crackers Even slim jims! You may catch your pet rat quickly, but it could feasibly take some time, so return often to see if your trap has sprung. Check back every two hours to make sure your rat doesn't go too long without water. Check the bait to make sure your rat hasn't eaten the bait without springing the trap. If you are unsuccessful in catching your rat for a day or two, look for a new place to put the trap or consider changing your bait.

Plot title: Infernal Affairs Movie plot: Infernal Affairs focuses on a police officer named Chen Wing-yan, who goes undercover into a triad, and a triad member Lau Kin-ming, who infiltrates the Hong Kong Police Force. Each mole has been planted by the rival organisation to gain an advantage in intelligence over the other side. The more the moles become involved in their undercover lives, the more issues they have to cope with. The prologue opens with the introduction of triad boss Hon Sam, who sends a number of young gangsters to the police academy as moles, among whom include a young Lau. Concurrently, a young Chen joins the police force but is seemingly expelled from the academy even though he manages to impress Superintendent Wong Chi-shing. In reality, Chen has become an undercover agent reporting only to Wong. Over the course of ten years, Chen experiences great stress from his undercover work while Lau quickly rises through the ranks in the police department. The film begins with a meeting between Chen and Lau in a hi-fi store without either of them knowing the other's identity. Wong and his team interrupt a deal between Hon Sam and a Thai cocaine dealer after receiving a tip-off from Chen using Morse code. However, Lau alerts Hon, giving him enough time to order his minions to dispose of the cocaine, eliminating solid evidence of the drug deal. After the incident, Wong and Hon are both aware that they each have a mole within their respective organisations, placing them in a race against time to root out the other mole. Later, Chen sees Hon conversing with Lau at a cinema but does not see Lau's face clearly; he ultimately fails to capture Lau. By this time, both Chen and Lau are struggling with their double identities â Chen starts losing faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; Lau becomes more accustomed to the life of a police officer and he wants to erase his criminal background. At their next meeting, Wong intends to pull Chen out of undercover work for fear of his safety. They are unaware that Lau has his...

He had recently suffered defeat in Wales, there were agricultural problems leading to a famine, and relations with the pope were worsening. Discontent amongst England's magnates led Henry to promise reform, but under continued pressure his authority disintegrated. A royal council of fifteen magnates was formed in June that year, and the rule of the country transferred from the king to the council. With foreign help Henry's reign was restored in 1261 as the council were reluctant to start a civil war. Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, raised a rebellion. In 1264 civil war broke out between those loyal to the king and the baronial forces led by de Montfort.Rochester's constable in 1264, Roger de Leybourne, held the castle in support of Henry. John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, was the garrison's co-commander. A baronial army led by Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, laid siege to the castle on 17 April that year. Having marched from the earl's castle to Tonbridge the army attacked from the Rochester side of the river, either the south or west. While the army advanced towards the city the royalist garrison set alight the suburbs. The king's hall within the castle was also burned down, although it is unclear why. An army under Simon de Montfort marched from London with the intention of attacking the city from another direction. The earl's first two attempts to cross the Medway were fought back, but he was successful on 18 April, Good Friday. The method used is uncertain, although it involved a fire-ship. The smoke may have been used as cover for the rebels, or the ship may have been used to burn the bridge while the army travelled by water. In a co-ordinated attack that had been pre-arranged, the armies of de Montfort and de Clare attacked the city. They entered Rochester in the evening and that night the cathedral was raided. The following day the rebels captured the castle's outer enclosure and the royal garrison retreated to the keep. Because the next day was Easter...

However, it's important to recognize that the information in the premise is somewhat informal and not entirely clear. Upon extracting essential information and identifying key aspects from the premise, we can develop a better understanding and carefully analyze the validity of the hypothesis. The premise highlights the following points: 1. Texas Instruments makes equipment for the semiconductor business. 2. They make (or were making) a lot of their own manufacturing equipment. 3. The time frame for this information is around the year 2000. Taking into account these points extracted from the premise, let's break down the hypothesis. Texas Instruments (TI) is a well-known, multinational, technology company that primarily focuses on designing and manufacturing semiconductors and various integrated circuits. Semiconductors are highly essential components, playing a crucial role in the electronics industry as they help enable the development of modern electronic devices, including smartphones, computers, and more. From the given premise, it is evident that Texas Instruments not only designs semiconductors but also involves in the manufacturing of equipment specifically designed for the semiconductor industry. The information reveals that the production of this manufacturing equipment was significant and possibly included various types of specialized machinery and tools specifically designed to facilitate the production and testing of semiconductors. Moreover, the premise suggests that the company takes an active role in manufacturing its own equipment, which could be driven by several factors, including cost-efficiency, customization of machinery to meet its specific requirements, or the desire to maintain control over the quality, reliability, and performance of their products. Lastly, as the premise refers to the year 2000, it's essential to identify that changes in the industry and a company's production capacity or focus could affect the extent to which Texas Instruments remains involved in the manufacturing of equipment for the semiconductor industry today. Given the information provided and analyzing the context, it's reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Texas Instruments manufactures equipment for the semiconductor industry\\" is likely true, at least around the year 2000.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who had six of at least eight bronze cannons?, using the article: Conquistadors often wore steel armour that included chainmail and helmets. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. Maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify the discomfort of wearing European armour. Quilted cotton armour, although still uncomfortably hot, was flexible and weighed much less. The Maya armour was adapted by the Spanish, who used knee-length quilted cotton tunics and Spanish-style caps. Horsemen wore long quilted cotton leg protectors; their horses were also protected with padded cotton armour. After the final push to the Petén lakes in early 1697, the Spanish recorded that they left with their garrison over 50 Dutch- and French-made muskets, three 1-pound (0.45 kg) calibre light cannons (piezas) cast from iron and mounted on carriages, four iron and two bronze pedreros (2-chambered stone-launchers) and six of at least eight bronze light cannons (known as esmiriles)., what would be the answer ?

Use the following highlights to write an article: Alzheimer’s Society said using drugs already available could be cheaper. and quicker way of tackling dementia. Other possible treatments include acne and psoriasis drugs. Article:","completion":"Title: Leveraging Existing Drugs: A Cheaper and Faster Approach to Tackle Dementia? Alzheimer’s Society, a leading charity organization working towards a world without dementia, has recently proposed an innovative approach towards handling this devastating condition - using drugs that are already available on the market. The society posits that this could potentially offer a quicker and more cost-effective solution to mitigating the impact of dementia, an idea that is opening a fresh avenue in the world of dementia research. The Alzheimer's Society, ground-breaking in its endeavor, believes in not underestimating the power of drugs we already possess. With its focus on drugs developed for other ailments, this perspective perhaps maximizes the utilization of our current arsenal in the healthcare sector. The rationale behind this method lies in its potential cost-effectiveness and speed. Development of new drugs requires considerable resources, both in terms of time and finance. By employing existing medicines, any auxiliary costs associated with research, development, and testing could be significantly reduced. Furthermore, the lengthy process of approval can also be circumvented, accelerating the speed at which these drugs reach the patients in need. The society highlighted two major types of already available drugs: those used in the treatment of acne and psoriasis. This brings hope for the possibilities these drugs can provide in the field where new, effective treatments are urgently needed. The organization suggests that these medicines, originally designed to treat skin conditions, might be repurposed to manage dementia, adding more weapons to the world's anti-dementia arsenal. On an ending note, while this innovative approach holds promise, it’s merely a potential idea just yet. It needs to be fortified by rigorous scientific research to reveal any side effects and determine the efficacy of these drugs for dementia. The prospect of finding faster, cheaper treatments for dementia marks an exciting turning point, which is only possible because of the relentless pursuit of solutions by organizations like Alzheimer's Society. In conclusion, Alzheimer's Society's novel approach could potentially change the game in dementia treatments. Their advocating for the use of existing drugs, like those for acne and psoriasis provides a platform for quicker, cheaper intervention. It's a path that could lead humanity to the much-needed breakthrough in the ongoing fight against dementia. I started the article by introducing the proposition by Alzheimer’s Society to use existing drugs to tackle dementia. I then went on to explain their reasons for choosing this approach, highlighting cost and time efficiency. I also mentioned that the organization is specifically looking at acne and psoriasis drugs as potential treatments. Towards the end, I added a cautionary note that more research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this approach.

Here is a goal: Prevent mildew inside bath toys. How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of preventing mildew inside bath toys, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Choose the right bath toys Justification: Not all bath toys are created equal. Some toys are more susceptible to mildew, such as toys made of fabric or foam and those with holes. Therefore, selecting bath toys made of non-porous materials, like rubber or silicone, will reduce the chances of mildew development. Step 2: Seal any holes in the bath toys Justification: Holes within a bath toy can accumulate water, which provides a conducive environment for mildew to thrive. Sealing these holes using a waterproof sealant prevents water from getting trapped inside the toy. Step 3: Dry bath toys completely after use Justification: Removing excess moisture as soon as possible after a bath helps to deter mildew growth. Place the toys on a drying rack or towel, ensuring that there is adequate airflow around them. Allow the toys to dry thoroughly before placing them in storage. Step 4: Clean bath toys regularly Justification: Regular cleaning helps to remove any dirt and soap residues that can contribute to mildew development. Use a mild bleach solution or a vinegar-water mixture to clean the toys at least once a week. Make sure to rinse them thoroughly and let them dry completely afterward. Step 5: Store bath toys in a well-ventilated area Justification: Storing bath toys in a damp, closed environment can encourage mildew growth. To avoid this, store the toys in a location with good air circulation, such as a mesh bag or open container, to keep mildew at bay. Step 6: Discard or replace severely affected toys Justification: In case some toys already have visible mildew growth, it is best to discard or replace them, as it can be difficult to remove the mildew completely without damaging the toy. This step ensures that the other toys remain safe and mildew-free."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

However, through some mechanism of the remote control, they are transported into the television, ending up in the Parkers' black and white Pleasantville living room. David tries to reason with the repairman (who communicates with him through the Parkers' TV set) but succeeds only in chasing him away. David and Jennifer must now pretend they are, respectively, Bud and Mary Sue Parker.Jennifer is dismayed to be stranded, but she and David begin exposing the town to issues such as sex, personal freedoms, styles of art, and literature.

Identifying the actions: - Sentence 1: Civil liberties groups protested; US district judge ruled - Sentence 2: Civil liberties groups filed suit; U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ordered the monument moved While the actions in both sentences are different, they indicate similar activities. \\"Protested\\" in the first sentence can be interpreted as \\"filed suit\\" in the second.

Identifying the central issue: - Sentence 1: The monument was an unconstitutional promotion of religion - Sentence 2: The monument was an unconstitutional promotion of religion by government The central issue in both sentences is the monument being considered an unconstitutional promotion of religion. The second sentence specifies that it's \\"by government,\\" while this is implicit in the first sentence (as it is a US district judge that is ruling on the matter).

Wikipedia has now gone dark, and hundreds of websites are joining the online encyclopedia Wikipedia in an Internet strike to protest anti-piracy legislation before Congress. Popular user-generated sites like Reddit and BoingBoing are following Wikipedia’s lead and going black for 12 to 24 hours to express outrage over the proposed laws.

Backers of both bills counter the laws are meant to address the widespread problem of online theft of American technology, music, movies and TV shows by foreign criminals.

Arnie's life begins to change when he buys a used red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury, nicknamed \\"Christine\\", in need of extensive repairs. Arnie begins to restore Christine at a local junkyard, Darnell's Autobody, but as he spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses differently, and develops an arrogant personality. Dennis and Arnie's new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul), discover the car's previous owner was obsessed with Christine and had died in it due to carbon monoxide poisoning. A group of bullies at schoolâangry with Arnie after a shop class confrontation results in Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) getting expelledâvandalize Christine. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine. As he examines the ruined car, he hears the creaking of metal and notices the engine is now fully restored.

She looked through the seed magazines. She ordered the tastiest kind of each vegetable and the prettiest kind of each flower. She talked to a friend about her plans. It seemed like the snow would never melt. But Josie didn't have to wait for spring to get started. Six weeks before the last frost, Josie planted seeds indoors. The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow. Finally spring arrived. Each day, Josie moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures. Josie worked in her garden, digging the soil. She added a special growing mix from the garden store to make the soil better. When everything was ready, she removed the seedlings from their trays and planted them in her garden. The warm sun and rich soil helped her vegetables and flowers grow. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What did Josie do to get started before the temperatures were warm?\\" is \\"Grew seedlings indoors\\"?","completion":"Yes, according to the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What did Josie do to get started before the temperatures were warm?\\" is indeed \\"Grew seedlings indoors.\\" As mentioned in the paragraph, Josie started planting her seeds indoors six weeks before the last frost. By doing this, she was able to give her plants a head start, allowing them to grow while it was still cold and snowy outside. This is a common gardening practice called \\"starting seeds indoors\\" or \\"indoor seed starting,\\" which allows gardeners to extend their growing season and have more control over the early stages of their plants' growth. Furthermore, it is mentioned that she gradually exposed the seedlings to the cooler outdoor temperatures by moving them outside for a few hours each day before finally planting them in her garden. This process, referred to as \\"hardening off,\\" helps the plants adjust to the temperature fluctuations and toughens them up before being planted permanently in the garden. To summarize, Josie's preparation for her garden before the warm temperatures arrived included starting her seedlings indoors, giving them a chance to germinate and grow in a controlled environment, and gradually hardening them off to adapt to outdoor conditions. This thoughtful approach allowed her to have a successful and thriving garden once the spring season finally arrived."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A good rule to follow is measuring the thread against the chosen strand of hair and make the thread 2-3 times longer than your hair or the extension you are wrapping. Measure out as many colors as you want to add to the first wrap and lay them out together. Once you try these basic designs, you can try new ways to create different unique patterns on your own braids. Most commonly, people choose to wrap just one braid but don't be afraid to wrap several braid strands or even do your whole head! You can keep your hair wrap in for a couple days or an entire month. Most people decide it is time to remove the wrap when it starts to smell or feel funny. No matter what, do not leave it on longer than a month. An old wrap can mold. If you want to keep rocking the wrap look, remove the old one and start a new one on a different piece of hair. To remove the hair wrap, carefully snip the knot off and unravel the thread.

In retaliation, Mark hangs his father in effigy, using a Cabbage Patch doll he's dressed up to look like his dad.Mark starts a frantic search for a scholarship program, however, his parent's wealth keeps him from qualifying. He finds one scholarship given to an academically exceptional student from the state of California each year. The only catch is that the student must be African-American to qualify. Mark talks to a friend of his who works as a pharmaceutical technician and obtains experimental tanning pills. Mark exceeds the suggested dosage and darkens his skin to appear black. The ruse works; Mark is able to fool his best friend, Gordon (who's also attending Harvard), and the scholarship committee.Mark and Gordon arrive in Boston and rent an apartment from an obviously bigoted man whose daughter, Whitney, will also be living in the same house. She quickly comes on to Mark, saying that she feels the pain of his slave ancestry. She also invites him to her parent's house for dinner which results in an uncomfortable evening for Mark; Whitney's father glares at him thinking he's only looking for a white girlfriend. The rest of the family has their prejudicial opinions of him as well.Mark and Gordon register for classes together, Mark breaking a minor oath with Gordon not to take criminal law - Mark sees that the professor, Banks, is also black and believes he can take advantage of the connection and will coast through the semester. However, Mark finds that Banks' class is much tougher than he thought and that Banks does not play favorites, no matter what race they are.Mark also meets a woman named Sarah, also a law student and is immediately... Answer:","completion":"Mark takes experimental tanning pills to appear as African-American in the movie Soul Man.

Premise: \\"Financial condition is a broader and more forward-looking concept than is financial position.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Financial position is not as forward looking and broad as financial condition.\\"?","completion":"Understanding the premise and the hypothesis requires an understanding of both financial condition and financial position. The financial condition of a business represents its ability to sustain its operations, fulfil its obligations, and meet its financial goals in the future. It is a comprehensive assessment encompassing all aspects of a business's financial situation, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows. This includes both tangible factors (like balance sheets, financial ratios) and intangible factors (like market conditions or governmental regulations). The financial condition is forward-looking because it not only assesses the present state of the business but also its future prospects concerning financial health and performance. On the other hand, the financial position of a company is usually understood as a snapshot of its current financial situation at a particular point in time, based on three key reports: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. It focuses primarily on the company's assets, liabilities, and equity, providing a tangible, quantifiable gauge of a business's economic resources, claims on those resources, and results of operations. So from these definitions, it seems reasonable to infer that the financial condition is indeed a broader and more forward-looking concept than financial position. Now let's turn to the hypothesis: \\"Financial position is not as forward looking and broad as financial condition.\\" Since we established that a financial condition considers a business's future potential, along with a more comprehensive set of financial and non-financial variables, and that financial position represents a more contained, present-focused picture of the business's financial resources, the hypothesis appears to be consistent with the given premise. Therefore, on the basis of this evaluation, the hypothesis that \\"Financial position is not as forward looking and broad as financial condition\\" is indeed entailed by the premise \\"Financial condition is a broader and more forward-looking concept than is financial position\\". The premise and the hypothesis essentially convey the same message but worded differently. Both suggest that when compared to financial position, financial condition provides a more comprehensive, forward-looking analysis of a business's finances. This understanding can be crucial for stakeholders (like management, investors, and financial institutions) who need a sense of the business's future potential and financial stability to make informed decisions. However, it's crucial to note that despite their differences, both of these assessments serve their unique purposes and are integral to understanding a business's overall economic situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy. This latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA. The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user — all without judicial oversight. The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...

What am I thinking happened to Jeremy in Rhode Island ?","completion":"Based on the information given, it appears that your thoughts regarding Jeremy's transformation after his return from Rhode Island could be attributed to a combination of factors, including self-reflection, newfound awareness, or even a significant event that influenced his mindset and priorities. The following points may explain your thoughts on what potentially happened to Jeremy during his time in Rhode Island: 1. Self-Reflection: Jeremy may have undergone a period of deep self-reflection while he was in Rhode Island. This time away from home could have provided him with the opportunity to introspect and evaluate his relationships, behavior, and priorities. By assessing his life and choices, he may have gained a sense of clarity and inner peace, which explains his newfound calmness and ability to handle situations like Zoey's crying. 2. Exposure to new ideas or philosophies: During his time in Rhode Island, Jeremy could have been exposed to new ideas, philosophies, or spiritual practices that led to his personal growth and transformation. Encountering new perspectives or beliefs may have helped him navigate life's challenges and stressors more effectively and subsequently influenced his emotional and mental well-being. 3. Resolution of past issues: Jeremy's change in demeanor could also stem from resolving past emotional or psychological issues. His time in Rhode Island could have allowed him to confront and work through any unresolved emotions, leading to an inner transformation and sense of tranquility in his life. 4. Significant event or encounter: Jeremy may have experienced a life-altering event or met someone particularly influential during his time in Rhode Island. This experience or encounter could have triggered a profound shift in his outlook on life, leading to his transformation and newfound calmness. 5. Self-realization: Perhaps Jeremy realized the impact his previous behavior had on others, especially Zoey. Witnessing the consequences of his actions may have been a powerful motivator for change. Consequently, Jeremy might have intentionally altered his behavior in order to become a better version of himself. Regarding the tattoo of the Celtic circle with the letter \\"Z\\" in it: 1. Symbolic representation: The letter \\"Z\\" within the Celtic circle is likely a representation of Zoey, possibly indicating the importance of his relationship with her. The decision to get this tattoo might signify Jeremy's commitment and dedication to improving his emotional connection with Zoey and being a more supportive and present figure in her life. 2. Reminder of transformation: The tattoo could also serve as a reminder of his personal transformation and growth he experienced during his time in Rhode Island. By imprinting a symbol of this change on his body, Jeremy may be carrying a constant reminder of his journey towards self-discovery and self-improvement. In conclusion, these are potential explanations for Jeremy's transformation after returning from Rhode Island based on the provided information. His newfound calmness and the choice to get a tattoo with Zoey's initial could indicate that he went through significant self-reflection or experienced an impactful event, ultimately leading him to develop a deeper appreciation for his relationships and priorities."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Imera (company)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

City A recently experienced heavy rainfall for several weeks. Meanwhile, city B hasn't had a single rainy day in the same time span. Which city would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain? Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. A:","completion":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, I will analyze the rate of weathering in both cities and determine which city would have less rock and soil material carried away by the rain. Step 1: Assess the rainfall situation in both cities - City A experienced heavy rainfall for several weeks. - City B did not have a single rainy day in the same time span. Step 2: Analyze the effect of rainfall on weathering - High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. - High rainfall may also carry material away, exposing new surfaces and increasing the rate of weathering. Step 3: Apply the weathering effect to the cities - In City A, heavy rainfall would have led to a higher rate of weathering and more material being carried away by the rain. - In City B, the lack of rainfall would have resulted in a lower rate of weathering and less material being carried away. Step 4: Compare the cities and draw a conclusion - The city with less rock and soil material carried away by the rain would be City B, as it did not experience any rainfall during the same time span when City A faced heavy rainfall. This means that the rate of weathering in City B would be much lower compared to City A, resulting in less rock and soil material being carried away by the rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They calmly explained that fees are \\"at their discretion.\\" To clarify I asked, \\"so, if I showed up and there was a random 100 hotel fee charged at your 'discretion' that would be fine with you?\\" They said yes!! SUPER SKETCHY! Our room didn't have any bedding and, when we called the front desk, they said they would call us back with a new room. (huh?) We had to explain that all we wanted was sheets. This seemed confusing to them. Much later we noticed that our room has obviously not been cleaned because there were shampoo/conditioner bottles all over the shower. Maybe that's why they wanted to move us to a room with bedding? Did the last person steal the bedding? Did housekeeping only take the bedding and nothing else? Unclear... The night before we left, we asked for a noon check out and it was granted. But at this point I wasn't so confident in the front desk's cognitive abilities. At 11 AM I called the front desk to confirm and they said we had an 11:30 check out. Nope. But whatever. We weren't eager to stay. Finally, my partner left his contacts in a bag in the bathroom. We kept calling the hotel but it took TWO DAYS for anyone to enter our room to clean it. (We left a pizza box so I'm sure that was fun) They insisted it wasn't there. We don't believe them. If I'd read the reviews I would have stayed away. Location is ok but not worth the crappy service and dirty room.

Understand the given physics problem related to the speed of a boat in still water. 2. Analyze the information provided. 3. Apply relevant equations or calculations to solve the problem. 4. Choose the correct answer from the multiple-choice options. Problem: In one hour, a boat goes 11 km along the stream and 5 km against the stream. The speed of the boat in still water (in km/hr) is: Let the speed of the boat in still water be 'b' km/hr, and the speed of the stream be 's' km/hr. When the boat goes along the stream (downstream), its effective speed is (b + s) km/hr. When the boat goes against the stream (upstream), its effective speed is (b - s) km/hr. From the problem, we have the following information: 1. The boat goes 11 km along the stream in 1 hour. 2. The boat goes 5 km against the stream in 1 hour. Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time 1. 11 km = (b + s) × 1 hour 2. 5 km = (b - s) × 1 hour Simplifying the equations: 1. b + s = 11 2. b - s = 5 Adding equations 1 and 2 to eliminate 's': (b + s) + (b - s) = 11 + 5 2b = 16 Dividing by 2 to get the value of 'b': b = 8 So, the speed of the boat in still water is 8 km/hr.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available choices: i. no; ii. yes;","completion":"Bulletproof Coffee is a branded coffee drink created by David Asprey, an entrepreneur, and author. It consists of a blend of freshly brewed coffee, unsalted grass-fed butter, and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, which is typically derived from coconut oil. The mixture is usually blended until smooth and frothy. Advocates of Bulletproof Coffee claim that it has several health benefits and can help with weight loss, enhance cognitive performance, and improve overall energy levels. Let's explore the various aspects of Bulletproof Coffee to understand its benefits and legitimacy. 1. Health Benefits: There are a few potential health benefits associated with some of the ingredients in Bulletproof Coffee: a. MCT Oil: MCT oil is a type of fat that can be easily and quickly converted by the liver into ketones, which are used as an energy source for the brain and muscles. Some research suggests that MCT oil may aid in weight loss, as it can increase satiety levels and boost metabolism, but these effects may vary depending on the individual. b. Grass-fed butter: Grass-fed butter is a good source of healthy fats and fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin K2, which plays a role in bone and cardiovascular health. It also contains butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that may have anti-inflammatory properties and enhances gut health. 2. Cognitive Performance: Proponents of Bulletproof Coffee argue that the combination of caffeine and MCT oil enhances cognitive function by providing a fast and reliable energy source for the brain. However, the scientific evidence supporting this claim is limited, and further research is needed to confirm these effects. 3. Energy Boost: Bulletproof Coffee can provide an immediate and sustained energy boost due to the combination of caffeine and healthy fats. Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that can increase alertness, concentration, and overall energy levels. The MCT oil and grass-fed butter provide a long-lasting source of fuel for the body, which may help to prevent energy crashes. Now, addressing the question of whether Bulletproof Coffee works and if it is legitimate: Bulletproof Coffee does provide some health benefits due to its individual ingredients, as discussed above. However, it is not a magical solution for weight loss or cognitive enhancement. Many of the claims surrounding Bulletproof Coffee are anecdotal and lack strong scientific evidence. In terms of weight loss, replacing a nutritious meal with a high-calorie coffee drink may not be the most sustainable or healthy option. Consuming Bulletproof Coffee instead of a balanced breakfast may lead to nutrient deficiencies, particularly if you are missing out on essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Additionally, excessive consumption of saturated fats found in butter and MCT oil may pose potential risks to heart health for some individuals. To conclude, both questions are inquiring about the same information to some extent. Although they address different aspects of Bulletproof Coffee, both questions ultimately seek to understand its benefits and legitimacy. The answer is that Bulletproof Coffee may provide some health benefits, cognitive performance improvement, and energy boost, but its claims regarding substantial weight loss and other enhancements are not well-supported by scientific evidence. It is essential to maintain a balanced diet and incorporate a variety of nutrient-rich foods alongside enjoying Bulletproof Coffee in moderation.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In communities north of prefix = st1 /Denver, residents are pitching in to help teachers and administrators as the Vrain school District tries to solve a 13.8 million budget shortage blamed on mismanagement . \\" We're worried about out teachers and principals, and we really don't want to lose them because of this,\\" one parent said,\\" If we can help ease their financial burden, we will.\\" Teachers are grateful, but know it may be years before the district is solvent . They feel really good about the parent support, but they realize it's impossible for them to solve this problem. The 22,000-student district discovered the shortage last month. \\" It's extraordinary. Nobody would have imagined something happening like this at this level,\\" said State Treasurer Mike Coffman. Coffman and district officials last week agreed on a state emergency plan freeing up a 9.8 million loan that enabled the payroll to be met for 2,700 teachers and staff in time for the holidays. District officials also took 1.7 million from student -activity accounts of its 38 schools. At Coffman's request, the District Attorney has begun investigating the district's finances. Coffman says he wants to know whether district officials hid the budget shortage until after the November election, when voters approved a 212 million bond issue for schools. In Frederick, students' parents are buying classroom supplies and offering to pay for groceries and utilities to keep first-year teachers and principals in their jobs. Some 36,000 has been raised in donations from Safeway. A Chevrolet dealership donated 10,000 and forgave the district's 10,750 bill for renting the driver educating cars.

Hypothesis: Becca is the third wheel on her friend Susan's ice skating date. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Based on the provided premise, we cannot conclusively determine whether the hypothesis is true. While the premise states that there is a group of three people ice skating, it leaves out critical information necessary for confirming the hypothesis. To properly analyze the situation, we would need more information about the individuals involved, their relationships to each other, and their intentions for the ice-skating event. Considering the initial premise, it is crucial to gather more details, such as: 1. Who are the three people ice-skating? Are Becca, Susan, and Susan's date included in this group? 2. What are Becca and Susan's relationships like, and how do they view each other? 3. Is Susan actually on a date during this ice-skating event? If so, who is Susan's date? 4. If Susan's date is present, what is Becca's relationship with that person? 5. What are the circumstances surrounding Becca's presence at the ice-skating event – was she invited by the couple, did she invite herself, or do they all frequently hang out together as friends? By addressing these questions, we will be able to draw a more informed conclusion about the hypothesis. For instance, if Becca, Susan, and Susan's date are indeed the three people in question and Becca has no close relationship with Susan's date, it is more probable that Becca could be the third wheel. However, if Susan's date is a mutual friend or if Becca has a strong relationship with the date, her presence might be part of a normal social dynamic. Also, the context of the gathering is crucial. If the gathering is a friendly get-together rather than a romantic date between Susan and her partner, Becca's presence would be more appropriate and less likely to imply her as a third wheel. In conclusion, while the hypothesis might be true, it cannot be confirmed solely based on the provided premise. More information about the individuals, their relationships, and the context of the ice-skating event would be necessary to make a definitive conclusion on whether Becca is indeed the third wheel on her friend Susan's ice-skating date."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

When it comes to long-lasting and efficient gardens, the choice of plants, soil and mulching materials is crucial. In this article, we'll be exploring the benefits of picking beds that house annuals instead of perennials, ensuring fabric permeability, and the step-by-step process of setting up and maintaining an efficient garden bed. Choosing the Right Garden Beds One way to maximize a garden's productivity and beauty is by selecting beds that support annuals, as opposed to perennials. Annuals, such as marigolds, petunias, and zinnias, are plants that complete their life cycle in just one season. They offer a vibrant and diverse range of colors to the garden, allowing for greater flexibility when planning your garden's design. Perennials, on the other hand, have a life expectancy of multiple years, making them less attractive for gardeners looking to change the appearance of their garden more frequently. Additionally, annuals typically have a more extended blooming period, contributing to an attractive and colorful garden for a longer duration. Furthermore, implementing annual plants can improve the health of the garden soil, as they contribute organic matter when they die back each year, nourishing the soil for future plantings. Ensuring Fabric Permeability When establishing a garden, it is critical to choose a fabric that is permeable (i.e., one that allows water and air to pass through). Permeable fabrics will enable the soil to maintain adequate oxygen and moisture levels, promoting healthy root growth and preventing plant diseases. Non-permeable fabrics can lead to suffocated root systems or even mold development, severely impacting plant health. Using a permeable fabric under a bed of mulch can also reduce weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and maintain even soil temperatures. This can contribute to a more controlled and low-maintenance garden setting, allowing you to spend more time enjoying your surroundings rather than tending to weeds or watering. Laying the Fabric and Mulch Here is a step-by-step guide on how to lay the permeable fabric and mulch effectively: 1. Prepare the garden bed: Remove any weeds or debris and loosen the top layer of soil. 2. Lay out the fabric: Roll the fabric across the garden bed in one continuous piece, ensuring that it covers the entire area. 3. Cut out shapes for existing plants or barriers: Using scissors or a utility knife, trim the fabric around existing garden plants or barriers, such as rocks or walkways. 4. Overlap seams if needed: If a single piece of fabric isn’t enough, lay the next piece alongside it, with a small overlap of about 3-4 inches. 5. Anchor the edges: Secure the fabric's edges using garden landscape staples or anchor pins, spacing them about 12 to 18 inches apart. This will prevent the fabric from shifting or being dislodged over time. 6. Place mulch on top: Add 2 to 4 inches of mulch on top of the fabric to conceal it and create a polished garden appearance. Mulch also has various benefits, including conserving moisture, regulating soil temperature, and suppressing weed growth. Conclusion Implementing the right garden bed choices, using permeable fabric, and following a proper fabric installation process can significantly boost the efficiency and aesthetic appeal of any garden. Both annual plants and a well-maintained fabric and mulch system offer benefits, such as a longer lasting, diverse, and colorful garden while simultaneously improving soil quality and promoting healthy plant growth. By adopting these practices, gardeners can save time, money, and effort, while enjoying a thriving garden space for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What may be the reason for the secrets only being his ?","completion":"Based on the given passage, there may be several reasons why the secrets are only his. The following analysis provides a detailed understanding of the possible reasons: 1. Feeling of Isolation as an Android: The main character was an android in the past, as mentioned in the passage. This might imply that he is not a regular human and perceives himself to be different from others. Due to the distinction, he may feel alienated or unable to connect with other people, resulting in him keeping the secrets to himself. 2. Fear of Exposure: The passage also mentions that the character hides his damaged metal body with his cloak. This suggests that he does not want others to discover his true nature, possibly due to the fear of being judged, shunned, or persecuted. His need for concealment might lead him to keep his secret exclusively to himself. 3. A Pivotal Event: The character's past as an android might have entailed a life-altering event that occurred to him alone. It is possible that he was involved in or witnessed something significant, and he cannot share it with anyone else due to the nature of the event. His reluctance to partake in the secret might stem from the belief that sharing it could lead to unforeseen consequences. 4. Protecting Others: Another reason for the character to hold on to the secrets could be a desire to shield others from harm or emotional distress. Realizing the potential danger or impact associated with these secrets, the character may choose to keep them to himself as a means of safeguarding those around him. 5. Personal Burden: Lastly, the secrets might be something that the character regards as a personal burden, resulting from past actions, mistakes, or guilt. He could feel solely responsible for the consequences of his secrets and thus, deems it necessary to keep them confined within himself. To conclude, the reasons for the secrets being only his may pertain to feelings of isolation as an android, fear of exposure, a pivotal event in his past, protecting others from potential harm, or carrying a personal burden. These reasons are deduced from the passage, which highlights the character's past as an android, his damaged metal body, and his efforts to conceal his true nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Capital Gains Taxes, Tax Loss Harvesting, and Wash-Sale Rules: Maximizing Your Investment Strategy Introduction: Many investors wonder how to optimize their investment strategy to minimize tax liabilities and maximize profits. The key to accomplishing this lies in understanding three crucial concepts: capital gains taxes, tax loss harvesting, and wash-sale rules. In this article, we will explain these concepts and help you learn when to sell stocks effectively for tax harvesting purposes. 1. Capital Gains Taxes: The first concept to understand is capital gains taxes. Capital gains taxes are levied on the profits made from selling an investment, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. These taxes come in two forms: short-term and long-term. Short-term capital gains taxes are applied to investments held for a year or less and are taxed as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains taxes, on the other hand, apply to investments held for over a year and are typically taxed at a lower rate than short-term capital gains taxes. This distinction is essential for investors as lower tax rates offer more incentive to hold investments longer, thereby encouraging strategic planning. 2. Tax Loss Harvesting: Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains taxes. This strategy helps in reducing an investor's overall tax burden. Essentially, if you sell an investment at a loss, you can use that loss to offset capital gains from other investments and reduce your taxable gains. It is imperative to time the sale of a losing investment accurately. One should sell before the end of a tax year to claim the loss against gains made in the same year. However, the difference between ordinary and long-term capital gains tax rates should also be considered. 3. Wash-Sale Rules: When employing tax loss harvesting, it is crucial to understand the wash-sale rules. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) implemented these rules to prevent investors from immediately repurchasing an investment they have just sold at a loss for tax-loss harvesting purposes. Per the wash-sale rule, if you sell an investment at a loss and then buy a \\"substantially identical\\" investment within 30 days before or after the sale, the loss cannot be claimed for tax purposes. This 61-day timeframe (including the date of sale) is critical to ensure compliance. 4. Selling Stocks for Tax Harvesting Purposes: With knowledge about capital gains taxes, tax loss harvesting, and wash-sale rules, you can now make informed decisions to sell stocks for tax harvesting purposes. When selecting stocks to sell, prioritize those with the highest tax liabilities. Consider the length of time you have held the stock and its potential for future growth. Keep in mind the wash-sale rules to avoid repurchasing identical investments within the given timeframe. In conclusion, minimizing tax liabilities while maximizing profits is achievable through understanding and leveraging capital gains taxes, tax loss harvesting, and wash-sale rules. By strategically selling stocks and taking advantage of the tax-loss harvesting process, investors can optimize their investment strategy and safeguard their financial growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Abstract OBJECTIVE: Emergency contraception (EC) is an effective pregnancy prevention strategy. EC is available without a prescription to those aged 17 years or older. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of information provided to adolescents and their physicians when they telephone pharmacies to inquire about EC. METHODS: By using standardized scripts, female callers telephoned 943 pharmacies in 5 US cities posing as 17-year-old adolescents or as physicians calling on behalf of their 17-year-old patients. McNemar tests were used to compare outcomes between adolescent and physician callers. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-nine pharmacies (80%) indicated to adolescent callers, and 766 (81%) to physician callers, that EC was available on the day of the call. However, 145 pharmacies (19%) incorrectly told the adolescent callers that it would be impossible to obtain EC under any circumstances, compared with 23 pharmacies (3%) for physician callers. Pharmacies conveyed the correct age to dispense EC without a prescription in 431 adolescent calls (57%) and 466 physician calls (61%). Compared with physician callers, adolescent callers were put on hold more often (54% vs 26%) and spoke to self-identified pharmacists less often (3% vs 12%, P < .0001). When EC was not available, 36% and 33% of pharmacies called by adolescents and physicians respectively offered no additional suggestions on how to obtain it. ||||| Handout A new Pediatrics study suggests that one in five drugstores deny teenage girls Plan B pills, though a law requires the emergency contraceptive to be available to 17-year-olds. Though a law requires pharmacies to make over-the-counter emergency contraceptives like Plan B available to 17-year-olds, a new study by the journal Pediatrics suggests one in every five drugstores are denying the young adults access. A total of 943 pharmacies in five major cities were contacted twice by researchers at Boston University: once posing a 17-year-old, and once as a doctor. Posing as 17-year-old girls, researchers called each drugstore requesting Plan B, the emergency contraceptive to be taken after unprotected sex, saying, “If I’m 17, is that okay?” Health.com reports. Almost 20% of the drugstores denied the “17-year-olds” access to the pill, despite the Food and Drug Administration having passed a law in 2009 requiring the “morning after” pills be made available to the young adults. When the researchers called the same pharmacies posing as doctors, only 3% of the drugstores said the over-the-counter pills weren’t available. When posing as an adolescent, researchers were put on hold 54% of the time, opposed to 26% of the time when calling as doctors, hinting at uncertainty by the drugstores, according to the Pediatrics publication. “It’s important that adolescents get the correct information the first time,” says Dr. Tracey Wilkinson, the lead author of the study, according to Health.com. “This highlights some of the barriers that adolescents face when accessing emergency contraception.” BIRTH CONTROL PILL TIP Researchers believe misinformation could lead to unwanted pregnancy for teens. The pill is meant to be taken within 24 hours after sexual intercourse, but the chance of pregnancy rises 50% if taken after 12 hours, the study shows. Researchers found that pharmacies in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to wrongly deny the teens access to the anti-pregnancy pill than in affluent neighborhoods, Time.com reports. Teen pregnancy is also more common in low-income neighborhoods. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is as follows: Despite a law requiring pharmacies to make over-the-counter emergency contraceptives like Plan B available to 17-year-olds, a study by the journal Pediatrics found that one in five drugstores denies young adults access.

This made everyone feel like they knew the special person, too. Then, Justin Bieber sang a beautiful song that he wrote just for this tribute. His voice was filled with emotion, which means he was truly feeling what he was singing about. Everyone who watched him could feel it, too. The audience was so moved by Justin's tribute that they clapped and cheered for him.

(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has made his proverbial bed. And, oh, is he lying in it now. The ugly comments about blacks and Latinos attributed to him have hit struck another nerve -- this time with players, fans and most decent-thinking Americans. NBA players protest racist talk attributed to L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling The tape released a few days ago reportedly shows that the person identified as Sterling can profess his own kind of love for a woman who's black and Latina but refuses to \\"allow\\" her to befriend her own kind: blacks and Latinos. Sterling allegedly says his girlfriend (whom he at one point on the tape calls \\"stupid\\") can meet with blacks and sleep with blacks but not take pictures with them (in this case former Lakers star turned entrepreneur Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson) or bring them to Clippers games. Like some slave owners who kept their mixed-race female slaves in better living conditions and bestowed privileges upon them, Sterling can allegedly be heard telling a woman identified as V. Stiviano that he doesn't have a problem with her or her race but that she shouldn't fraternize with blacks and Latinos because it disturbs him. He selected her.

A Conversation With John Casey For four decades, John Casey has shaped how trillions of financial assets are managed more so than any other strategist. Casey, Quirk & Associates, the successor to Barra Strategic Consulting Group that John established with his partners in 2002, is the trusted advisor to some of the most prestigious, innovative and ultimately successful investment managers and financial institutions. Casey Quirk has advised a majority of the world’s 50 largest investment management organizations since the beginning of 2009 including the London Stock Exchange and Barklays Global Investors. I was more than a little curious before my lunch with John in the Casey Quirk office in Darien, Connecticut. Refreshingly, the man whom Pensions & Investments famously coined “the king maker” was completely devoid of hubris. While reflecting on how he identifies winners in the investment management industry, John shared that “investment acumen” is not enough. He also looks for “good commercial instinct and good business sense.” John warned that “many people in this business say ‘I am so smart and I do not need anybody. However, the best money managers know that they need a team to succeed.” During our meeting, I observed that he practices what he preaches. The Casey Quirk team is incredibly important to him and John engages and brings in various team members and seeks alternative points of view to complement his own perspective. Our conversation included John Case and partner Jeff Stakel. Katina Stefanova: Looking back on the asset management industry, do you think that the industry has become more demanding and complicated overtime. John Casey: Yes, certainly. During the early 70s, all investors were looking for was investment acumen or perceived investment acumen. Let us not forget that in 1972, the entire pension fund industry was 200 billion and the whole mutual fund industry was only 50 billion and that includes money market funds. The 1973 – 74 equity debacle encouraged investors to look for alternatives to the big banks. So many new firms came to life. In the late 70s and through the mid-80s, thousands of firms became SEC-registered advisors. It took little capital and infrastructure to start a money management business. Planning, good management and technology were not as essential in those earlier days. The barriers to entry are much higher today both because the industry is saturated and because investors are more educated. Several generations of professionals have grown up inside pension funds, public and private global investors have learned a lot during both periods of volatility and growth over the past three decades. Thus today, an asset manager needs to be a well-run business that can pass extensive due diligence. Passion isn’t enough. Stefanova: An educated investor is a good thing overall. There has been a general backlash against underperformance by hedge funds. CALPERs is withdrawing from direct hedge fund investing. Warren Buffett made a prediction that index funds would win over a decade over hedge funds and is so far winning. Do you think such a reaction is justified? Casey: The smart investor today is looking at what do you get once all the costs are paid. Casey Quirk has published several whitepapers over the years that focus on what we believe investment managers need to do to successfully meet investor needs. What is the return after all costs are factored in is going to be a real challenge for investment managers. Thus we have had the increase in passive vehicles which have grown into a multi-trillion industry. If the hedge funds want to be important, they need to deliver net returns that are valuable and consistent. However, the last six years are not representative as the equity markets have gone mostly straight up. If we were to have a downturn, hedge funds may become popular once again assuming that they offer good risk management. Hedge funds have become more popular as a risk management tool in a global asset management portfolio. Stefanova: Do you think it is easy to assess who are the asset managers that can deliver positive risk adjusted return going forward? Surely, just looking at past returns is not enough. I wrote an article about the risk blindspots of portfolio management. How does Casey Quirk advise investors to differentiate amongst asset managers and find quality? Jeff Stakel: We would think about what we call “investment quality” as certainly broader than the investment return that is delivered to investors at the end of the month, the quarter, and the year. Going back to John’s point, we look at the total quality of the client experience, which includes the investment strategy, the risk management, the consistency and quality of the portfolio, the caliber of the team overseeing the investments on a daily basis. One of the big things that we see as a trend in the industry is the alignment of interest: What are investors demanding and are the managers addressing these specific needs in the appropriate manner. Stefanova: Do you go beyond the portfolio strategy to understand the risks embedded in an asset management company and assess the technology infrastructure, the processes and controls, and more broadly the operational risk in the firm? As you know the majority of financial services failures happen because of operational risk issues and lack of controls? Stakel: Katina, your point is spot on. John shared the importance of business management beyond investing and distribution. It applies to a broader operational infrastructure and risk management. For sophisticated buyers today, holistic risk management is almost table stakes, which is why as discussed, the barriers to entry in the investment management industry today are much higher than they were previously. Casey: However, firms and clients brush over some of these issues and they are taken for granted. There is not enough deep understanding of the characteristics of the non-investment aspects of a business. Possibly, this could be because there are not enough people who understand the various non-investment aspects of an asset management firm at the level of depth required. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The hedge fund industry has become increasingly demanding and complicated over time, mainly due to the saturation of the market and the higher levels of education of investors today. A hedge fund needs to be a well-run business that can pass extensive due diligence to succeed in the competitive market. Investors are now more focused on risk-adjusted returns and measuring the overall client experience. This means going beyond just investment returns and considering factors such as investment strategy, risk management, consistency and quality of the portfolio, and the caliber of the team managing the investments. To thrive in this industry, hedge funds must deliver net returns that are valuable and consistent, addressing the specific needs of their investors while maintaining strong operational infrastructure and risk management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

Deciding whether a couch is to your exact taste and can stand the test of time is almost impossible to do with pictures alone. That being said, online reviews are helpful for learning other people’s thoughts on the comfort and durability of potential couches. Make sure you are comfortable with the return policy of the couch distributor and the quality of customer support you’re likely to get if you experience troubles with your purchase. You may have to pay shipping if you order online, and will probably need to be present when the couch is delivered. Contact the couch company immediately if you find any problems. Sit how you normally would on the couch, then see how you feel. Different couches have different softness, and factors like seat depth and armrest height make a difference, too. Lower arms are good for curling up and getting comfy while watching TV, while multi-cushion sofas might be harder to nap on and firm seat backs are more supportive if you usually sit upright. Swaying, creaking, or squeaking indicate poorly installed springs or a weak frame. Lift one side about 6 in (15 cm) off the ground. If the leg on the other side is still touching the ground, the frame is weak. The couch legs should be attached to the frame by screws and pegs, not just glue, staples, and nails. They should be tight and close together, but not feel like they are poking through the fabric. If the sofa has only webbing or mesh, it will probably be uncomfortable and flimsy. Feel free to ask the salesperson for a swatch of the upholstery to bring home, where you can see how the fabric looks in artificial and natural light and test how easy it is to clean. Cotton and linen upholstery is reasonably priced and easy to clean, and microfiber blends can act like cotton and are stain resistant. Leather looks nice and lasts a long time, but is extremely expensive. Natural blends with polyester can snag and wear out overtime. Silk gives the couch a sleek look but is very hard to care for. The average couch sells for 1,000 but designer couches can cost 10,000. The couch should compliment the space you are going to put it in, and feel like a piece you’ll want in your home for many years to come. Discuss the price for delivery up front, and make sure you can get a full refund if the store doesn’t deliver on time. Summary:","completion":"A couch is an important and big item to buy. It's hard to know if you'll like it just from pictures, so reading reviews can help. Check the return policy and customer support too. When buying a couch, think about how soft it is, how deep the seats are, and how high the armrests are. Make sure it doesn't make noises or feel weak. The legs should be strong and well-attached. Check the fabric to see if it's good quality and easy to clean. Couches can cost from 1,000 to 10,000, and you should make sure it fits well in your home.

Erin gathers evidence, including photographs and internal documents, to back her case. Act 3: Armed with irrefutable proof, Erin contacts authorities and environmental watchdog organizations. As news of the scandal begins to surface, she encounters threats from mysterious individuals working for PE&G, who will stop at nothing to keep the company's secret from going public.

Roll the liner back up over your residual limb. It should fit snugly, but not feel uncomfortable. When the silicone liner is fully in place, the strap or pin emerging from the bottom of the liner should be centered over your residual limb. Not all prostheses require the use of a silicone liner. If your doctor didn’t give you a liner, you don’t need to wear one when putting on your prosthesis. Lower the strap into the open top of the cupped portion of your prosthesis. The bottom of the cupped section (which will hold your residual limb) should have a 2 in (5.1 cm) slot. Feed the strap through this small slot. Let the strap hang down to the ground for now. Then place your stump into the cupped section of the prosthesis. If your silicone liner has a pin at the base instead of a strap, this will work a little differently. Just push your residual limb into the prosthesis and put downward pressure on it until your pin clicks and locks. Below the cupped socket that you put your residual limb into there will be a pipe that supports the limb, followed by an extremity piece that is designed to look like a real hand, foot, or other limbs. Your silicone liner will be 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) longer than is needed to cover your residual limb. Grasp the excess silicone and fold it back down so it covers the top of the cupped socket. This will keep your prosthetic limb anchored firmly against your residual limb. It will also serve as a cushion so that the cupped part of the prosthetic limb doesn’t rub directly on your limb. Lift up the strap that you fed through the bottom of the prosthesis earlier. Slip the loose end of the strap through the O-shaped ring that’s at the top of the prosthesis’s cupped socket. Then secure the strap in place by hooking its loose end to the Velcro patch next to the slot that you fed the strap through earlier. When it’s hooked into place, this strap keeps the base of the silicone liner (which contains your stump) firmly in place inside the cupped socket. This allows the prosthesis to move naturally as you walk as if it were part of your body. To remove the prosthesis, simply un-hook the Velcro, loop the strap back through the O-ring, and lift your stump out of the prosthesis’ cupped socket. Many people have prosthetic limbs that attach with a pin at the bottom of the silicone sleeve. To remove the leg, simply press in on the small button located at the bottom of the limb, just above the foot. Some people like to customize their prostheses with thin nylon sleeves. Put on the sleeve like a large sock: stretch out the opening, stick the prosthesis through, and then stretch the sleeve up until it fully covers the prosthesis. If you choose not to wear a sleeve, you may skip this step. The sleeves come in different colors and patterns (e.g., tie-dye or camouflage) and can be purchased through medical-supply stores. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary for this is: To put on a prosthesis with a silicone liner, turn the liner inside out, put your stump in it, and roll the liner up. Then, put your stump in the prosthesis cup and secure it with a strap or pin. When it's on and secure, the prosthesis should move naturally like a real body part. To take it off, undo the strap or press the button near the pin. Some people use a special sleeve to cover and decorate their prosthesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Премьер-министр Израиля Беньямин Нетаньяху (там проживает всего 7 миллионов человек) вновь и вновь демонстрирует, что гораздо эффективнее оказывать США открытое неповиновение и относиться к этой стране с презрением. Translate this to English?","completion":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who resides in a country with a population of just 7 million people) repeatedly demonstrates that it is much more effective to openly disobey the United States and treat this country with contempt. In recent years, Benjamin Netanyahu's relationship with the United States has been a matter of great debate and concern in the international arena. The Israeli Prime Minister, despite residing in a country with such a modest population, has shown a somewhat brazen attitude towards the US. As the leader of a key ally in the Middle East, some find his behavior quite surprising. Netanyahu's open defiance and contempt for the United States raise questions about the effectiveness of the US-Israeli relationship and the impact of this defiance on the world stage. By disregarding the US's wishes, Netanyahu could potentially be damaging his country's standing and the vital support it receives. However, some speculate that Netanyahu's actions can be attributed to his efforts to strengthen Israel's internal position and consolidate power by asserting its independence. One key area where Netanyahu's defiance has become increasingly apparent is in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The United States has long been an advocate for a two-state solution, based on the belief that peaceful co-existence between Israel and Palestine is necessary for regional stability. However, Netanyahu has consistently pushed for Israeli settlements in the disputed territories, in direct opposition to the US's stance on the matter. This has led to significant tensions between the two nations. Moreover, the handling of the Iran nuclear deal has also exemplified Netanyahu's disregard for the United States. While the US sought to negotiate and implement the agreement to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, Netanyahu vehemently opposed the deal and took his concerns directly to the US Congress. By circumventing the diplomatic channels, the Israeli leader further strained relations with the US. Despite these apparent challenges posed by Netanyahu's actions, it is vital to recognize that the US-Israeli relationship continues to be crucial for both parties. The United States has provided significant financial and military support to Israel over the years, and Israel remains a key ally in the region. In conclusion, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has gained attention for his brazen behavior and defiance of the United States on various occasions. While this may be effective in asserting Israel's independence and strength, it remains to be seen if Netanyahu's approach will ultimately benefit or harm his nation's interests in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: when did o canada become canada's national anthem?","completion":"\\"O Canada\\" officially became Canada's national anthem on July 1, 1980, when the National Anthem Act received royal assent during the tenure of the 22nd Canadian Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau. This change was made to mark the 100th anniversary of the lyrics written by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier in 1880. However, the journey of \\"O Canada\\" to become the national anthem spans several decades and entails multiple historical events that contributed to the anthem's evolution and eventual official status. The origins of \\"O Canada\\" can be traced back to 1880 when Calixa Lavallée composed the music for a patriotic song commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Théodore Robitaille, to celebrate St. Jean-Baptiste Day (June 24). Concurrently, Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier, a French-Canadian poet and judge, penned the French lyrics for the song. \\"O Canada\\" was first performed publicly on June 24, 1880, at a banquet in Quebec City. However, at this time, it was not considered a national anthem but rather a patriot song for French Canadians. The first English version of \\"O Canada\\" was created in 1901 by a Toronto doctor named Thomas Bedford Richardson. Many other English versions followed suit in the subsequent years. In 1908, Robert Stanley Weir, a prominent Canadian social figure and judge, wrote an English version of the song that proved to be more popular and eventually formed the basis for the modern English lyrics. Weir's adaptation underwent minor modifications in 1913 and again in 1927. As time went on, \\"O Canada\\" steadily grew in popularity among Canadians. From 1927 onwards, the government began using the song for official state ceremonies, adding to its significance. Though \\"God Save the Queen\\" held the status of the official anthem for several years, \\"O Canada\\" served as an unofficial national anthem for various events and occasions. In 1964, the Canadian government created the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism to address issues of bilingualism, biculturalism, and the perceived lack of representation of French-speaking Canadians. The commission recommended that \\"O Canada\\" be recognized as the country's national anthem. Subsequently, in 1967, the government of Canada launched a competition called \\"Sing Out Canada!\\", inviting submissions for alternative anthems. However, no suitable alternative was deemed capable of replacing \\"O Canada.\\" Instead, this event reinforced the importance and attachment of Canadians to the song, demonstrating that it had been deeply ingrained within the Canadian identity. In the years following the competition, multiple attempts were made by members of Parliament to pass bills and enact legislation to make \\"O Canada\\" the official national anthem. These efforts eventually culminated in the successful passage of the National Anthem Act, which received royal assent on June 27, 1980, and officially adopted \\"O Canada\\" as the national anthem on July 1, 1980. In conclusion, \\"O Canada\\" was officially recognized as Canada's national anthem on July 1, 1980, after a lengthy historical journey spanning a century, various adaptations, and a cultural investigation into the country's bilingual and bicultural nature. Over time, the anthem has become a powerful symbol of Canadian identity, unity, and patriotism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the three sister ships of the one that entered service on October 26th, 1850? ? With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the...

A:","completion":"This product review can be considered negative for several reasons, even though the reviewer does not explicitly express dissatisfaction with the battery itself. They do, however, raise concerns regarding the lack of available information and support, which implies that the reviewer might not be entirely satisfied with their experience. The reviewer begins by stating that they have questions about the battery, which could indicate potential issues they are trying to resolve. It could also suggest that the product's documentation or online resources are not providing sufficient information to address their concerns. While the reviewer does not directly criticize the battery's quality or performance, the fact that they are seeking help implies an inconvenience and possible doubt about the product. Moreover, the reviewer mentions that they are unable to find answers to their questions, which indicates a lack of readily available resources. This highlights that there might be an issue with customer support or a gap in the provision of essential information. When a person is unable to receive support or locate the answers they need, it perpetuates a negative impression of the product and the company manufacturing it. Lastly, the reviewer specifically requests the phone number for Makita, the manufacturer of the battery. This suggests that they have not found an appropriate channel to address their concerns, leading them to request direct contact with the company. Once again, this creates a negative perception around the company's customer service and communication channels. In summary, while the review does not explicitly criticize the battery's quality or performance, the issues raised by the reviewer about unanswered questions, limited resources, and difficulty contacting the company contribute to a negative impression of the product and its manufacturer. By addressing these gaps in customer service and providing better resources and an easily accessible means of support, companies can foster a more positive experience for customers and improve their overall product reputation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island contributed more to global warming? Hint: Pollutants also affect the atmosphere through their contribution to global warming. Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure below ). Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air.

Jessica contracted chronic urinary tract infections more frequently than Tanya, because Choose your answer from: [A]. Jessica had better hygiene. [B]. Tanya had better hygiene. Answer:","completion":"[B]. Tanya had better hygiene. Jessica contracted chronic urinary tract infections more frequently than Tanya, because Tanya had better hygiene. Tanya was very particular about her personal cleanliness and followed a consistent and thorough hygiene routine. This routine included practices such as always wiping from front to back after using the toilet, avoiding the use of harsh soaps or bubble baths, staying well-hydrated, and minimizing irritants near her genital area. By maintaining a high level of personal hygiene, she was able to keep bacterial growth in check, reducing the likelihood of experiencing a urinary tract infection. On the other hand, poor hygiene in Jessica's case contributed to her increased susceptibility to urinary tract infections. Jessica did not pay much attention to her hygiene practices, and she did not follow some of the crucial steps that could have helped her minimize the chances of contracting urinary tract infections. For instance, Jessica often stayed in wet swimsuits for extended periods, allowing harmful bacteria to thrive in the damp environment. The lack of care around her genital area created an ideal breeding ground for bacteria, increasing the likelihood of UTIs. Additionally, Jessica's poor hygiene habits extended to other aspects of her life as well. She did not consume enough water, which allowed bacteria to build up in her urinary tract instead of being flushed out by frequent urination. Jessica also did not change her underwear as often as she should have, increasing the chances that bacteria would accumulate around her genital area. In conclusion, the primary reason for Jessica's higher rate of chronic urinary tract infections, as compared to Tanya, was Tanya's consistent attention to maintaining good personal hygiene. By diligently following proper practices, Tanya actively decreased the presence of harmful bacteria around her genital area, making it significantly harder for her to develop a urinary tract infection. Jessica's lax hygiene practices, on the other hand, made her more susceptible to infections caused by excessive bacterial growth. To avoid recurrent UTIs, Jessica could benefit greatly from adopting the same hygiene habits that Tanya follows."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Actress Kate Hudson trod the red carpet with her partner, Muse singer Matt Bellamy, while co-star Liev Schreiber attended with his partner Naomi Watts. The star-studded premiere followed reports claiming this year's festival had struggled to attract big \\"names\\". The film, directed by Mira Nair, got a mixed reception from critics. Nair won the festival's top prize, the Golden Lion, for Monsoon Wedding in 2001. In her new film, Britain's Riz Ahmed plays a young Pakistani man who becomes a high flier on Wall Street before being radicalised in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Time magazine praised it as a \\"tense, thoughtful and truly international\\" film that \\"raises questions meant to test America's conscience\\". Ahmed - who previously played an incompetent bomber in Chris Morris's satire Four Lions - stood out in \\"a star-making role\\", it added. The 29-year-old was also singled out by Screen International, whose critic said he gives \\"a finely nuanced performance that carries the film\\". Overall, though, reviewer Mark Adams concluded that the film \\"never finds the right pacing or structure to satisfy the dramatic arcs\\". Variety said the film \\"saddles itself with a laborious narrative structure and half-baked thriller elements\\". But the Hollywood Reporter described it as \\"a serious-minded film whose politics demand soul-searching and attention\\". Hamid's book was nominated for the Booker Prize in 2007. Speaking on the red carpet, Nair said she wanted to reflect the fact that \\"the modern Pakistan is nothing like what you read in the papers\\". She added that she hoped to bring \\"some sense of bridge-making, some sense of healing, basically a sense of communication that goes beyond the stereotype\\". This year's line-up also includes To The Wonder, the latest from Tree of Life director Terence Malick, and Robert Redford's The Company You Keep. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix star in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master, the story of a religious cult that some have suggested bears a resemblance to Scientology.

Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day. Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him.

What company was the owner of the 7-Eleven brand in Scandinavia?","completion":"The owner of the 7-Eleven brand in Scandinavia was the Reitan Group. On 27 August 2007, Royal Dutch Shell and the Reitan Group announced an agreement to re-brand approximately 269 service stations across Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals under the different competition laws in each country. In addition to partnerships like the one with the Reitan Group, Royal Dutch Shell has pursued various business strategies and operations globally. For instance, in April 2010, Shell announced it was in the process of finding a potential buyer for all of its operations in Finland and was conducting similar market research concerning its operations in Sweden. Several months later in October 2010, Shell's gas stations and the heavy vehicle fuel supply networks in Finland and Sweden, were sold to St1, a Finnish energy company, more specifically to its major shareholding parent company Keele Oy. In the wake of that transaction, Shell-branded gas stations were planned to be rebranded within a maximum of five years from the acquisition and the number of gas stations was likely to be reduced.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality. I am facing a new situation today: Red fishery and Brown fishery were both fishing for Patagonian toothfish. Red fishery was fishing illegally, while Brown fishery was regulated and lawful. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fishery did more unreported fishing? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background article. From the article, we know that there are problems associated with increased solar ultraviolet radiation, which has reduced phytoplankton and damaged fish DNA. Additionally, we know that illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is negatively affecting the sustainability of Patagonian toothfish, with long-line fishing methods causing a high incidence of seabird mortality. Step 2: Apply the relevant information to the new situation. In the new situation, we have two fisheries: Red fishery and Brown fishery. Red fishery was fishing illegally, while Brown fishery was regulated and lawful. Step 3: Answer the question. The question asks which fishery did more unreported fishing. Based on the information provided, we can determine that Red fishery, which was operating illegally, likely did more unreported fishing compared to Brown fishery, which was regulated and lawful. This conclusion aligns with the background information stating that illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is affecting the sustainability of Patagonian toothfish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Aaron Sharp PUBLISHED: 05:31 EST, 18 September 2013 | UPDATED: 17:04 EST, 18 September 2013 Plea: Starbucks Coffee CEO Howard Schultz, pictured above, has written an open letter to customers in the US asking them not to bring guns into their cafes Starbucks will not enforce a US wide ban on guns in their stores, despite another mass shooting in America this week. The coffee chain has been forced to state its position on the gun debate which has been reignited after crazed gunman Aaron Alexis shot 12 people dead in a Washington Navy yard this week. In an interview, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said anyone carrying a firearm would be 'unwelcome' in","completion":"his establishments, but the company would not implement an outright ban. This decision stems from a desire to prioritize the safety and comfort of all customers, while also respecting the varying opinions and legal rights surrounding gun ownership in the United States. Schultz explained that Starbucks has always strived to create a warm, inviting atmosphere that unites people from all walks of life. However, the growing presence of firearms in the public sphere, coupled with recent tragedies involving gun violence, has made it increasingly difficult for businesses like Starbucks to navigate the delicate balance between supporting individual liberties and ensuring the well-being of their patrons and employees. The CEO recognized that adopting an unyielding stance on the matter could pose numerous challenges, both legally and logistically. While some states permit open and concealed carry of firearms in public places, others impose stricter regulations, and a blanket prohibition may inadvertently place Starbucks at odds with local statutes. Moreover, enforcing a ban could create unnecessary tension between staff and customers, potentially escalating volatile situations and exposing the company to potential legal liabilities. Instead, Schultz called for thoughtful, respectful discourse and implored customers to leave their firearms at home, emphasizing that the decision to prohibit guns was ultimately a matter of personal choice and civic responsibility. In his open letter, he outlined the company's position, stating that Starbucks respects the right of individuals to bear arms, but that the company would prefer customers to refrain from bringing weapons into its cafes. He urged those who insisted on carrying firearms to exercise caution and discretion, with consideration for the diverse and often opposing views held by other customers. This multifaceted approach showcases Starbucks' commitment to promoting social unity without compromising legal rights or alienating its diverse clientele. By acknowledging the complex, sensitive nature of the gun debate and taking a diplomatic yet firm stance, the company aims to strike a balance that respects personal freedoms while mitigating potential risks associated with firearms in public spaces. Schultz's plea for gun owners to engage in civil discourse around the issue may also play a crucial role in fostering a more inclusive, empathetic understanding of gun ownership and regulation in the United States. As society continues to grapple with the challenges and implications of gun control, Starbucks' nuanced response to the issue demonstrates a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and signals a potential path forward for other businesses navigating this contentious terrain."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Paragraph: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L.

Answer the following question: Process: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt - Become magma again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less metamorphic rock melts happens, how will it affect more magma cools. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The process you have outlined is known as the rock cycle, which describes the formation, transformation, and recycling of rocks on Earth through a series of geological processes. The perturbation hypothesis you suggest involves the reduction of metamorphic rock melting. To assess the potential effects of this perturbation on the process, we need to consider each stage of the rock cycle and how they might be influenced by this hypothetical scenario. 1. Magma generation from a volcano: Metamorphic rock melting is just one way in which magma is formed. Magma can also form from the partial melting of the mantle or through the melting of other crust materials, such as oceanic or continental crust. If less metamorphic rock melts, there could be a decrease in the overall volume of magma produced. However, the other processes that generate magma would still continue, which might partially offset the reduction in magma production from metamorphic sources. 2. Magma cooling: If there is less magma produced from metamorphic rock melting, this would lead to a decrease in the amount of magma available to cool and crystallize into igneous rocks. Consequently, fewer igneous rocks would form over time. The overall rate of magma cooling would likely be affected as a result of the reduced input from melting metamorphic rocks. 3. Formation of sedimentary rocks: Since less igneous rock is formed due to the reduction in magma production, there may be a decrease in the amount of rock available to break down into sediment. As the weathering and erosion of igneous rocks are essential to the formation of sedimentary rocks, this reduction may lead to fewer sedimentary rocks being formed overall. 4. Heat and pressure leading to metamorphic rocks: With fewer sedimentary rocks available for metamorphism, the formation of metamorphic rocks might also be reduced. However, since the amount of metamorphic rock melting is already decreased in this perturbation hypothesis, this could create a feedback loop that further reduces the formation of metamorphic rocks, compounding the overall effect through the rock cycle stages. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of less metamorphic rock melting would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the rock cycle process, particularly on magma cooling. The reduced output of magma from melting metamorphic rocks would lead to less overall magma, which in turn results in less igneous rock formation. This, in turn, would affect the formation of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. While other processes might partially compensate for these reductions, the overall balance of the rock cycle would be altered by the decreased input from metamorphic rock-derived magma."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: - The filter has small pores to catch pollutants - The filter will catch chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals - The filter allows water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through - The water on the other side of the filter is much cleaner - What might be the first step of the process?

Translate this to English?","completion":"North Africa, particularly Morocco, holds strategic importance for the European Union. North Africa, including countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, and Egypt, has a significant strategic importance for the European Union (EU) on various levels. As neighboring regions separated by the Mediterranean Sea, the close proximity allows for strong diplomatic, economic, and socio-political relationships to be formed. Firstly, on a geopolitical level, North Africa functions as a buffer for Europe against security threats emerging from unstable regions in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, Morocco has been a reliable and key partner in the counter-terrorism efforts and the fight against irregular migration. Additionally, as a major non-NATO ally, Morocco has increased its military cooperation with European countries to maintain regional security and stability. Secondly, North Africa underwent a political shift during the Arab Spring, which began in 2011. The EU has taken an interest in promoting democratic reform and good governance in these countries to further ensure stability and development in the region. In doing so, the EU believes that this will strengthen the relationship between the two regions and provide a foundation for long-term economic and socio-political cooperation. Thirdly, North Africa is a critical gateway for European businesses looking to access African markets. Trade and investment opportunities are abundant, as many North African countries, including Morocco, offer access to natural resources, large markets, and a growing workforce. The EU is Morocco's largest trading partner, and the two regions have established various political and economic agreements to strengthen their cooperation. Moreover, Morocco has positioned itself as a stable bridge between Europe and the rest of the African continent, serving as an important partner for Europe's business expansion plans. Lastly, the EU-North Africa relationship has a significant focus on addressing migration and human trafficking. As a transit region for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East into Europe, North Africa has been a focal point of the EU's efforts to manage migration flows and improve border control. Morocco, in particular, has played an essential role in cooperating with the EU in managing migration and refugee issues, receiving financial assistance and technical support from European countries to tackle this challenge. Overall, North Africa, particularly Morocco, holds strategic importance for the European Union due to its geopolitical position, potential for economic growth, role in regional security, and as a partner in addressing common challenges such as migration. Strengthening these relations benefits both Europe and North African countries, paving the way for stability and prosperity in the regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In the north of Scotland there is a lake called Loch Ness. It is the biggest lake in Britain. It is over thirty kilometres long and in places nearly 300 meters deep. It is cold and dark and not many people went there until after 1930. Then a road was made around the lake. Holiday makers began to use the road, and this was when the stories began. Someone said that he had seen a monster in the lake. He said it was twelve meters long. It had a long neck and a small head. Then someone else said he had seen it. Others said the same thing and in 1933 a London doctor took a photo. It looked like a monster with a long neck and a thick body but the photo was not dear. The newspapers printed the picture and called it the Loch Ness monster, or \\"Nessie\\". Then the argument began. Some people, however, were certain there was something living in the lake. Others said there was nothing there. In 1961, a lot of people joined together to make a real effort to see and photograph the monster if there was one! Several times people thought they saw something but after ten years there was still no real proof. Later underwater television cameras were used, but no one found any real proof. However, they did find something interesting: a huge underwater cave. It was big enough to be home of a monster, but of course, this was not a proof. In 1975, however, some American scientists formed a search group. They used an underwater camera. It took pictures every seventy seconds. Some of the pictures seemed to show a red-brown creature. Its body was about four meters long and had a very ugly head on the end of a four meter neck. Many people then began to believe in the monster. But even today we can not be certain.

News article: Buckinghamshire artist Tomas Georgeson has left a blank cheque for £8,000 in Milton Keynes Gallery in the hope it will raise local interest in the town’s fledgling art scene. Georgeson told the Telegraph that he concealed the cheque in the gallery on Tuesday morning, and has placed an advert in a local paper to inform local residents. The advert, which will be printed in The Milton Keynes Citizen on Thursday, says: “A blank cheque for £8,000 has been hidden somewhere in the public spaces of Milton Keynes Gallery. It will be collected on 1 March 2013 if unclaimed.” Georgeson says that he decided to hide the cheque as a statement of support for the gallery, and that he wanted to “get people through the door and change the mood of the place.” When the new town was devised in the late 1960s, Milton Keynes received generous funding for the arts in an attempt to encourage local culture. However, Georgeson says that the “brave” creative decisions that helped form the town in the 1970s had slowed by the 1980s to make way for developments which would generate cash flow more quickly. “You can’t just implant culture in a city and expect it to thrive,” Georgeson says. “But now it seems it’s the time for culture to come to Milton Keynes.” While Georgeson says that he’ll stand by the cheque as an artistic statement, it is meant as a benevolent gesture to the gallery and its visitors, rather than an intrusion on the exhibited work. “The integrity of what the gallery does is fantastic,” he comments, “but I see a disconnect between the gallery and the public.” Georgeson says that the £8,000 represents nearly all the money he has. “It won’t bounce if somebody finds the cheque and cashes it. I’m prepared to live with the consequences of that happening, and I could only be prepared if I thought it would really do some good” he said. ||||| An art gallery is at the centre of an off-the-wall treasure hunt - after an artist claimed to have hidden an £8,000 cheque among its exhibits. Milton Keynes Gallery said it had no prior knowledge of Tomas Georgeson's apparent attempt to boost its visitor numbers by concealing the cheque - with the payee left blank - in one of its public spaces. Mr Georgeson, who has previously worked as a volunteer at the 300-square-metre gallery, hopes the potential windfall will boost interest in local art and break down a \\"disconnect\\" between the visitor attraction and the public. He told The Daily Telegraph: \\"It won't bounce if somebody finds the cheque and cashes it. \\"I'm prepared to live with the consequences of that happening, and I could only be prepared if I thought it would really do some good.\\" The Buckinghamshire-based artist is reportedly planning to collect the cheque on 1 March if it has not been found. Milton Keynes Gallery's communications director, Katharine Sorensen, was only made aware of the artist's claims when she was contacted by a reporter yesterday. Ms Sorensen told the Press Association: \\"I put the phone down and went and had a look (around the gallery) with colleagues and couldn't see anything. \\"It's not something we know about and we can't confirm or deny whether it's a hoax or not.\\" Ms Sorensen said the director of the gallery had made contact with Mr Georgeson after news of his offer broke. \\"He (Mr Georgeson) says he has placed something in the gallery, but that it is not underneath or on any artwork so there is no need for anyone to touch the actual exhibits,\\" Ms Sorensen added.

I can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did. I guess it's all part of the dumbing down of America. Personally, like David Spade said, I liked this show better when it went by its original title - \\"Seinfeld\\". What bothers me the most about this show, aside from the obvious, base sense of \\"humor\\", and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled. Truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like, \\"the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized\\", on the \\"Dick Van Dyke Show\\", or \\"the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory.\\" In other words, it's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers. That the writers and producers of \\"Friends\\" would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes, themselves, in such a fashion, before anyone's even had a chance to even see it a second time, speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers, but, also, of the stultified minds of their viewers.

Sterling 9mm weapon, which fires 500 rounds a minute, and a. balaclava, were discovered on the Pembury Estate in. east London by a Hackney Gangs Unit. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the police officers. were cycling past the play park, an area known as a hang-out for the. Pembury Boys gang, when there was a commotion and around ten men dispersed. The weapon: The Sterling Parabellum 9mm sub-machine gun was found on the Pembury Estate in east London by a Hackney Gangs Unit. The suspicious officers searched the area and found the weapon wrapped in a plastic bag. Not far from the scene, they found bullets, a kitchen knife and a balaclava, also in a plastic bag. Fingerprints belonging to the defendants were found on the bags. Tyrell Goather, 21,and Helal Miah,. 17, were sentenced to a combined eight years in prison, while Philip. Johnson, 18, was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order at. Snaresbrook Crown Court for possession. Found guilty: Helal Miah (left) was sentenced to three years in jail and Tyrell Goather (right) was sentenced to five years in prison. They are all believed to be ‘younger’ members of the notorious Pembury Boys gang, whose turf war with the rival London Fields Gang was the inspiration for Channel 4 drama Top Boy about East London gangs. Goather was also key witness in the murder trial of Shaquille Smith, who was stabbed as he sat in a park near London Fields in 2008. Jailing the defendants, Judge Wendy Joseph said: ‘There have been many incidents in London in recent years when young people have been killed or maimed and innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire. Philip Johnson was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order. ‘This was a British Army issue sub-machine gun capable of being fired repeatedly. It was in a children's playground on a heavily populated estate. It was near to live ammunition that could be fired from it. ‘It is obvious that a gun to be used to threaten only does not require ammunition.’ A hat and bike belonging to Miah were dumped near to the weapon. The gun was linked to two non-fatal shootings in south London in 2009 after undergoing police testing. Both Miah and Goather denied the charges and gave alternative explanations as to why their DNA was found on the weapon and bullets, but their accounts were rejected by a jury. Johnson, who is homeless after his gang activity put his family in danger, admitted looking after the bullets for ‘around half an hour’ while he was staying with a friend. Describing the offence as one of ‘significant gravity’ Judge Joseph said: ‘I know it is not easy to grow up on such an estate where there are others encouraging people to join activities that are not legal. ‘But yours is a story of why no young person should join a gang.’ Sentencing Goather, whose testimony jailed the murderers of his friend Shaquille, she added: ‘You of all people should have known better than to associate himself with those who obtain weapons.’ The men are all believed to be members of the Pembury Boys gang, whose turf war with the rival London Fields Gang was the inspiration for Channel 4 drama Top Boy (Top Boy actors pictured) Goather was convicted of possession of an offensive weapon and possession of ammunition and sentenced to five years in prison. Miah, who can be named after the judge lifted reporting restrictions, was convicted of the same offences and sentenced to three years in prison. Johnson, who admitted possession of ammunition, was found not guilty of possession of an offensive weapon and was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order due to the six months he had served in custody on remand. Detectives from the borough’s Operation Bantam gun crime unit later linked the weapon to the three through DNA evidence and analysis of phones. Police believe they were left in charge of the weapon for the ‘older’ members of the Pembury gang.","completion":"Three gang members in East London were found guilty of possessing a sub-machine gun and its ammunition, which were stashed near a children's playground in the area.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Process: - The pancreas detects chemical changes in the stomach - The pancreas creates juices that help digest food - The pancreas releases the juices into the stomach - Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest protein - Insulin is produced to move glucose from the blood - The enzymes begin producing again. Question: suppose I to started vomit happens, how will it affect I had a section removed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"Vomiting can have a range of effects on the body, particularly if you have had a section of your pancreas removed. To better understand these effects, it's important to consider both the function of the pancreas in digestion and the impact of vomiting on the digestive process. The pancreas plays a critical role in digestion by producing and releasing digestive juices into the small intestine, including trypsin and chymotrypsin, which break down protein. Additionally, the pancreas is responsible for producing insulin, a hormone that regulates glucose levels in the blood. When a section of the pancreas is removed, the remaining portion of the pancreas typically continues to produce digestive enzymes and insulin. However, depending on the size and location of the removed section, the function of the pancreas may be somewhat diminished. When vomiting occurs, food and stomach acid are expelled from the stomach, interrupting the normal digestive process and potentially compromising the body's ability to absorb nutrients from the consumed food. This can disrupt both the breakdown of protein by trypsin and chymotrypsin and the absorption of glucose, which in turn affects insulin production. Considering these factors, vomiting may have one of three potential effects: A) More effect: If the function of the pancreas is significantly diminished due to the removed section, vomiting could exacerbate existing digestive issues. In this scenario, the body may struggle to digest food properly and regulate glucose levels, leading to greater discomfort, fatigue, or other symptoms associated with malabsorption and poor blood sugar control. B) Less effect: In some cases, the remaining portion of the pancreas may be able to compensate for the removed section, maintaining sufficient digestive function and insulin production. Vomiting could still disrupt the digestive process, but its impact may be less severe if the pancreas is able to continue functioning effectively. C) No effect: It's also possible that vomiting could have no noticeable effect on a person with a removed pancreas section, particularly if the vomiting is a one-time or infrequent occurrence, and the pancreas is functioning well. However, this outcome is less likely if vomiting persists or worsens over time, as ongoing disruption of the digestive process could eventually affect the pancreas's ability to effectively produce enzymes and insulin. In conclusion, the impact of vomiting on a person who has had a section of their pancreas removed will largely depend on the specific circumstances and the individual's overall pancreatic function. It's important to closely monitor any changes in digestion or overall health and consult with a healthcare professional if symptoms persist or worsen, as additional intervention may be necessary to manage adverse effects."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\".

The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.

William Chinnery's father, also named William, owned trading ships and named one Gilwell in 1800. William and Margaret Chinnery initially resided in London, and after three years of marriage and inheriting Gilwell in 1792, they moved to Gilwell in 1793. They soon shocked the populace by renaming Osborne Hall to \\"Gilwell Hall\\". William Chinnery expanded Gilwell's land holdings through significant purchases over 15 years and, with his wife, transformed it into a country estate with gardens, paths, and statues. Parts of the garden, paths, and dwelling modifications exist into the 21st century. William Chinnery was exposed as the embezzler of a small fortune from the British Treasury where he worked and was dismissed from all his posts on 12 March 1812. Margaret Chinnery was forced to sign over Gilwell Estate to the Exchequer on 2 July 1812.The Chinnery family was prominent enough that members of the English nobility visited often during the 1790s and early 19th century. King George III visited on occasion, and the Prince Regent, who later became George IV, was a regular visitor. George III's seventh son, Prince Adolphus, became a family friend, lived at Gilwell for a while, and tutored their eldest son George.Gilpin Gorst bought the estate in 1815 at public auction, and his son sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When London Bridge was replaced in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades, which date to 1209, and erected them behind the White House around the Buffalo Lawn. The estate changed ownership more times, but these families did not maintain the property and it fell into disrepair by 1900. Reverend Cranshaw, a local resident, bought the estate in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association, as it was then known.

The piece was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in 1999 as one of the shortlisted works for the prestigious Turner Prize, an annual award given to a British visual artist under the age of 50. Tracey Emin is a well-known British artist who is closely associated with the Young British Artists (YBAs), a group of artists who emerged in the 1980s and 1990s to gain international prominence and attention. Emin's controversial work often explores themes of intimacy, vulnerability, and personal experiences. Her artwork encompasses a variety of mediums, including drawing, painting, sculpture, film, photography, and installations. The \\"My Bed\\" art installation represents a significant moment in Emin's life. Created in 1998, the piece features a disheveled double bed with stained sheets, surrounded by various items, such as soiled underwear, slippers, empty alcohol bottles, condoms, cigarettes, a pair of pants stained with menstrual blood, and other personal objects. The inspiration behind the work was a period of emotional turmoil Emin experienced after a breakup, during which she stayed in bed for several days without eating and drinking, only leaving the bed to use the bathroom. The artwork is a confessional piece, presenting the artist's most personal space to the audience, and articulating her emotional state during that particular time. It invites the viewers to reflect on their own intimate and vulnerable moments and confront the taboos around the messy aspects of everyday life. When \\"My Bed\\" was displayed in the 1999 Turner Prize exhibition, it sparked conversations and debates concerning the nature of art, what can be considered art, and the role of an artist. While Emin's provocative piece did not win the Turner Prize that year, it remained one of the most discussed and iconic artworks from the shortlisted nominees as well as an influential work of the YBA movement. The work later sold at a Christie's auction in 2014 for over £2.5 million, further cementing its place in the history of contemporary art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000...

Cal Worthington, a car dealer whose off-the-wall commercials, first broadcast in the 1950s, bombarded California television viewers for more than half a century and made him a pop culture legend, died on Sunday at his ranch in Orland, Calif. He was 92. His family confirmed his death. Mr. Worthington sold a lot of cars â more than a million of them, by his count â and at his peak in the 1960s ran an empire of 29 dealerships from San Diego to Anchorage. But it was the way he sold them that made him a byword for creative hard-sell salesmanship in the great American tradition. Stuck with a dud location when he bought his first dealership, Mr. Worthington decided that the only way to attract customers was to hit the airwaves hard with radio and television commercials that stood out from the pack. This turned out to be his ticket to fame and fortune. In relentless campaigns that treated television viewers to as many as 100 commercials a day, Mr. Worthington proclaimed the virtues of the latest gem on the lot while, for example, strapped to the wing of a soaring biplane or standing on his head on the hood of a car â a visible demonstration of his motto, âI will stand upon my head until my ears are turning red to make a deal.â In the background, a chorus of male voices and frantic banjo pickers sang a jingle to the tune of âIf Youâre Happy and You Know It,â each of its many verses ending with the tag line: âGo see Cal, go see Cal, go see Cal.â The madness only escalated. When a rival dealer began using a pet dog in his television advertisements in the early 1970s, Mr. Worthington rustled up a gorilla and told the audience: âHowdy, Iâm Cal Worthington and this is my dog Spot. I found this little fella down at the pound and heâs so full of love.â Spot reappeared as a hippo, an iguana and a snake, but never a dog. In other Spot spots, which ran until the 1980s, Mr. Worthington rode Shamu the killer whale at an aquatic theme park while waving his cowboy hat, chauffeured a tiger in a golf cart and sat astride an elephant. All the while, the Cal chorus belted out the promise of fabulous deals: If you need a better car, go see Cal.For the best deal by far, go see Cal.If you want your payments low, if you want to save some dough,Go see Cal, go see Cal, go see Cal. The exuberant cheesiness of Mr. Worthingtonâs ads made him a folk hero, as much a part of California popular culture as Woodies with surfboards on the roof or Orange Julius stands. He was a frequent guest on âThe Tonight Show,â where Johnny Carson performed ad parodies. He appeared as himself in the 1973 Jack Lemmon film âSave the Tigerâ and was the model for the car salesman played by Ted Danson in the 1993 film âMade in America.â He even infiltrated Thomas Pynchonâs novel âInherent Vice.â Calvin Coolidge Worthington was born on Nov. 27, 1920, in Bly, Okla., a tiny town that no longer exists. He was one of nine children living in a shotgun house with no plumbing. He wore clothes made from old flour bags. âWe were starving and barefooted,â he told The Los Angeles Times in 2010. âI had a very awful childhood.â His father moved the family to Kilgore, Tex., where there was work in the oil fields. Cal dropped out of school at 13 and, after working as a water boy on a road crew, signed on with the Civilian Conservation Corps, blazing trails in what would become Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Keen on becoming a pilot, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1942 and flew B-17 Flying Fortresses on 29 bombing missions over Germany. He left the military with the rank of captain, a Distinguished Flying Cross and hopes of becoming a commercial pilot, but lack of a college degree disqualified him. Instead, using the 500 he made from selling his car, he bought a gas station in Corpus Christi, where his family had moved. The station did not prosper, but he sold used cars on the side and, after getting rid of the station, established his first dealership, Dependable Used Cars. In 1948 he bid on a load of welding rods being sold off as war surplus in Hawaii, sold his car dealership to pay for them and drove out to Los Angeles to take delivery, hoping to save money by shortening the distance. A longshoremanâs strike stranded the rods, and by the time they were unloaded they were so water-damaged that it took Mr. Worthington two years to sell them off. Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Cal Worthington, a famous car dealer, passed away at the age of 92.

If you do work for a larger corporate chain, inquire about opportunities in other cities or states and at new stores. Companies will be more likely to hire someone that shows initiative and has experience with their model of restaurant. For more options, be willing to relocate to accept a position.

Which American TV sitcom, originally aired from 1974 to 1984, presented an idealized vision of life in 1950s and early 1960s America????","completion":"The American TV sitcom that originally aired from 1974 to 1984 and presented an idealized vision of life in 1950s and early 1960s America is \\"Happy Days.\\" Created by Garry Marshall, the show was a spin-off from an episode of the anthology series \\"Love, American Style,\\" called \\"Love and the Television Set.\\" Filmed at Paramount Studios, \\"Happy Days\\" was produced by Henderson Productions, Miller-Milkis Productions, and later by Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions. Set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, \\"Happy Days\\" revolves around the life of Richard \\"Richie\\" Cunningham, played by Ron Howard, and his family, friends, and life in their community. The show depicts a simpler time when life seemed more carefree and innocent. The main characters who usually hang out at the local diner called Arnold's Drive-In are Richie, his sister Joanie (Erin Moran), their parents Howard (Tom Bosley) and Marion (Marion Ross), Richie's best friend Potsie Weber (Anson Williams), and the iconic, cool, motorcycle-riding, leather-jacket-wearing tough guy Arthur \\"Fonzie\\" Fonzarelli (Henry Winkler). \\"Happy Days\\" started as a single-camera show with a laugh track. However, from the third season onwards, it switched to a multi-camera format shot in front of a live studio audience. The program's characters and tone changed significantly over its 11 seasons, with the early seasons focusing on the teenage misadventures of Richie, Potsie, and Fonzie. Gradually, the show shifted to focus more on Fonzie, who grew to be the central character, and his exploits in the community. Many storylines featured Fonzie's ability to solve problems with his cool charisma, sometimes resorting to his famous catchphrase \\"Aaay!\\" \\"Happy Days\\" enjoyed massive success during its run and was frequently ranked among the top-rated TV shows of its time. The show is responsible for popularizing the term \\"jump the shark,\\" which refers to a point in a TV series when its quality significantly declines due to far-fetched or ridiculous storylines. This phrase originates from a fifth-season episode of \\"Happy Days,\\" where Fonzie literally jumps over a shark while water-skiing, an event that many critics and fans believe marked the beginning of the show's downturn in quality. On a cultural level, the show has had a massive impact. \\"Happy Days\\" has inspired more spin-off series than any other sitcom in TV history. The popular shows \\"Laverne & Shirley,\\" \\"Mork & Mindy,\\" and \\"Joanie Loves Chachi\\" are just a few examples. Additionally, the program has had a profound influence on American popular culture and nostalgia for the 1950s and 1960s, as well as on fashion, music, and other aspects of American life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Trump file an annual financial disclosure form with the Office of Government Ethics? Options: A. to stop false accusations against him for his financial dealings B. it is prerequisite to running for the office of President C. not enough information D. it is required of all top government officials under US law A:","completion":"D. it is required of all top government officials under US law"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tver Carriage Works offers the following products and provides the following services: In this phrase, Tver Carriage Works \\"offers\\" products, which means they make them available or present them for someone to use or buy. Additionally, they \\"provide\\" services, which means they supply or furnish them for someone to utilize or benefit from. 2.

Movie plot title: The Prestige Movie plot: In early 1900s London, magician Robert Angier performs his trick, 'The Real Transported Man,' to a sold out theater. Rival magician Alfred Borden, in disguise, sneaks under the stage. At the trick's culmination, Angier drops through a trap door and into a waiting water tank, where Borden watches him drown. At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingÃ©nieur, John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads. In flashback, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, alongside ingÃ©nieur John Cutter and assistant Julia, who is also Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a water tank, from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a more secure, yet difficult knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, infuriating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden. Borden launches a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his ingÃ©nieur, Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who gives birth to their daughter, Jess. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers.

The language recognition is the first step, so that you know what type of translation you need to make. Part #2: Understand the meaning of the sentence in Italian. Usage: This part requires understanding of Italian language. For instance, the word \\"estremità\\" means \\"end\\", \\"asse\\" means \\"axis\\", and \\"bomba\\" means \\"bomb\\". So a rough meaning of the start of the sentence is \\"at the end of the axis, which corresponds to the 'Bomb' hypothesis.\\" Part #3: Translate each word or phrase from Italian into English, maintaining the original sentence’s meaning and structure. Usage: For example, the phrase “all ’ estremità dell ’ asse delle ascisse\\" could be translated to \\"at the end of the x-axis\\". This maintains the meaning of the phrase between the languages but will depend on knowledge of both languages to ensure proper translation. Part #4: Verify the translated sentence makes sense in English and retains the original sentence's intention. Usage: The translated sentence could be: \\"At the extremity of the x-axis, which corresponds to the \\"Bomb\\" hypothesis. At 130 or at some point beyond 130, between the bomb option and the one related to the production of fissile material sufficient for the construction of a nuclear bomb.\\" The intention of presenting a hypothesis related to the concept of a 'bomb', expressing a particular point (130), and introducing the two options related to the 'bomb' is retained in this English translation. Each part instruction is crucial, ensuring accurate understanding of the sentence, appropriate translation to the English language, and retention of original intention from Italian to English."},{"prompt":"Information: - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused. - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries. - Aristophanes (or ; c. 446 c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it. - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis. - The Clouds (\\"Nephelai\\") is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes. A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens, it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423BC and was not as well-received as the author had hoped, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year. It was revised between 420 and 417BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - The Wasps (\\"Sphkes\\") is the fourth in chronological order of the eleven surviving plays by Aristophanes, the master of an ancient genre of drama called 'Old Comedy'. It was produced at the Lenaia festival in 422 BC, a time when Athens was enjoying a brief respite from the Peloponnesian War following a one-year truce with Sparta. - Carcinus ( Greek : ) was an Ancient Greek tragedian , and was a member of a family including Xenocles ( a father or uncle ) and his grandfather Carcinus of Agrigentum . He received a prize for only one out of his one hundred and sixty plays , many of them composed at the court of Dionysius II of Syracuse . Only nine titles , with associated fragments , of his plays have survived : Achilles , Aerope or Thyestes , Ajax , Alope , Amphiaraus , Oedipus , Orestes , Semele , and Tyro . He and his sons were lampooned by Aristophanes at the end of The Wasps and in Peace . All three of those sons became playwrights . Carcinus is mentioned briefly by Aristotle . In the Poetics , Chapter 17 ( 1455a lines 22 to 29 ) , Aristotle discusses the necessity for a playwright to see the composition on the stage , rather than just in print , in order to weed out any inconsistencies . Aristotle points to an unnamed play of Carcinus which had a character , Amphiaraus , exit a temple . For some reason ( presumably the events prior ) , this seemed outrageously inconsistent when viewed on the stage , and the audience \`\` hissed '' the actors right off the stage . It seems this particular inconsistency was not easily recognised by merely reading the script . - Syracuse ( \\"Syrakousai\\"; Medieval ) is a historic city in Sicily, the capital of the province of Syracuse. The city is notable for its rich Greek history, culture, amphitheatres, architecture, and as the birthplace of the preeminent mathematician and engineer Archimedes. This 2,700-year-old city played a key role in ancient times, when it was one of the major powers of the Mediterranean world. Syracuse is located in the southeast corner of the island of Sicily, next to the Gulf of Syracuse beside the Ionian Sea. - Xenocles is the name of two Greek tragedians. There were two Athenian tragic poets of this name, one the grandfather of the other. No fragments of either are currently known, except for a few words of the elder apparently parodied in Aristophanes' \\"The Clouds\\". - The Lenaia was an annual Athenian festival with a dramatic competition. It was one of the lesser festivals of Athens and Ionia in ancient Greece. The Lenaia took place in Athens in the month of Gamelion, roughly corresponding to January. The festival was in honour of Dionysos Lenaios. \\"Lenaia\\" probably comes from \\"\\"lenos\\"\\" 'wine-press' or from \\"\\"lenai\\"\\", another name for the Maenads (the female worshippers of Dionysos). - Dionysius the Younger or Dionysius II (343 BC) was a Greek politician who ruled Syracuse, Sicily from 367 BC to 357 BC and again from 346 BC to 344 BC. What is the relationship between 'carcinus ' and 'classical athens'? A:","completion":"Carcinus was an Ancient Greek tragedian who lived and worked during the era of Classical Athens.

Carcinus composed many of his plays at the court of Dionysius II of Syracuse.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Food - Water enter the body - Bloodstream - Food and water enter the pancreas - The pancreas breaks down carbs - Helps digest other foods and liquids. Question: suppose A person eats less food than needed happens, how will it affect \\"food isnt processed by the body\\". How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If a person eats less food than needed, it will have the following effects on the process mentioned: 1. Food - Less intake of food will limit the availability of nutrients in the body. 2. Water enter the body - If the person also consumes less water, it may lead to dehydration and reduced overall body function. 3. Bloodstream - The bloodstream may receive fewer nutrients, which could limit the body's ability to distribute essential resources to cells, tissues, and organs. 4. Food and water enter the pancreas - The pancreas may receive less food and water than necessary, potentially impacting its ability to function at optimal levels. 5. The pancreas breaks down carbs - The pancreas might have fewer carbohydrates and other nutrients to break down, affecting the generation of energy in the body. 6. Helps digest other foods and liquids - With less food and water intake, the pancreas might provide reduced assistance in the digestion process. Question: How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned (food isn't processed by the body)? Answer: Eating less food than needed could lead to a situation where the body is unable to process all the food consumed due to the inadequate availability of essential nutrients. It may result in reduced digestive efficiency, which would be considered as a \\"more\\" effect in relation to the second effect mentioned (food isn't processed by the body). While the body attempts to compensate and process the limited available food, the overall effectiveness with which it does so might be negatively affected due to the reduction in nutrient intake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Access to the underground workings at the La Camorra mine is via a ramp from the surface, excavated at a -15% grade and connecting numerous levels. Can we draw the following conclusion? The La Camorra is a dangerous place to work.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the La Camorra mine is a dangerous place to work. The fact that the mine has a ramp leading to multiple underground levels does not inherently imply that the working conditions are hazardous. However, mining industries do commonly face potential danger and risks associated with working underground. In order to draw a well-informed conclusion about the safety of working at the La Camorra mine, several factors would need to be considered. 1. Safety Regulations and Compliance: Assess whether the mine complies with local, national, and international safety regulations. This would cover aspects such as appropriate ventilation, illumination, emergency protocols, and the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for workers. 2. Training: The quality and frequency of safety training sessions for workers can significantly impact the level of danger at the mine. This would include training on proper equipment handling, addressing hazards related to the specific mining techniques employed, and recognizing and responding to signs of potential threats like rock falls, explosions, or water ingress. 3. Work Practices: Safe practices for activities like drilling, blasting, haulage, and support installation are crucial in ensuring a low-risk work environment. It is important to assess whether these practices are being followed correctly and if any deficiencies exist. 4. Monitoring Systems and Risk Management: Regular inspections and monitoring of the mine’s conditions can help identify and mitigate risks. This would involve monitoring for air quality, ground stability, and the presence of hazardous gases like methane or carbon monoxide. Institutions like the La Camorra mine should have established risk management procedures to identify, manage, and communicate any emerging hazards effectively. 5. Incident Records: Reviewing the history of safety-related incidents at the mine can help determine whether it has a higher than normal frequency of accidents or injuries. Comparing these records to industry benchmarks or similar mines can provide insights into the relative safety of working at La Camorra mine. 6. Geotechnical and Geological Conditions: The stability of the mine depends on the nature of the rock and the geological structures present within the deposit. Some mines may experience higher levels of instability and risk due to these factors. 7. Equipment and Infrastructure: Properly maintained equipment and infrastructure can significantly reduce the risk of accidents. It is necessary to check whether the mine has an adequate maintenance schedule and modern safety systems in place. In summary, while it is not possible to draw the conclusion that the La Camorra mine is a dangerous place to work based solely on the presence of a ramp with a -15% grade, it is crucial to consider various factors, such as safety regulations, training, work practices, risk management, incident records, geotechnical conditions, and equipment maintenance. By analyzing these aspects, one could gain a better understanding of the safety conditions at the La Camorra mine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After tending to one of the Mexican children, Angel Obregon II, she presses Bick to take steps to improve their condition. When riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs; War Winds bucks her off, killing her.

Answer:","completion":"To determine the category for \\"Barrier River,\\" I will analyze the possible meanings and connections to the list of categories provided.

Verb: \\"mixed\\" - The verb \\"mixed\\" is the action that the subject, \\"I,\\" is performing. \\"Mixed\\" is the simple past tense of the verb \\"to mix\\", which indicates that the action has already been completed. 3. Direct Object: \\"the eggs\\" - The direct object in the sentence is \\"the eggs\\", which is the item being mixed in the action. \\"Eggs\\" is a plural noun, and \\"the\\" is the definite article accompanying the noun, indicating that the speaker is referring to specific eggs. 4. Preposition: \\"with\\" - The preposition \\"with\\" is used to show the relationship between the eggs and the cream, indicating that they are mixed together. 5. Object of the Preposition: \\"cream\\" - In this sentence, \\"cream\\" acts as the object of the preposition \\"with\\". It is a singular, uncountable noun representing the additional ingredient being mixed with the eggs. Together, these elements create a grammatically sound and syntactically correct sentence. However, it is essential to note that linguists often recognize more than one way to convey an idea appropriately, and the concept of a \\"strict standard\\" can vary depending on the linguistic and stylistic approaches. While this sentence meets the typical requirements for correctness, the flexibility of language may lead some linguists to phrase it differently or accept slight variations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When I told my husband,who was right there when it happened, he assumed my eye was just blurry or something had gotten in the eye. He took me to the ophthalmologist who verified that I could not see out of the eye. Then we subsequently got the worse news that it was a neurological condition with a long name I do not remember that there was nothing he could do about. He said that I would either get my sight back or I you and all we could do was wait and see if it came back. This was right before finals that semester but he told me I absolutely could not be studying or using my good eye for reading or basically anything that would strain it or I could end up losing sight in that eye also. Needless to say, as a mom of two children ages 2 1/2 and 6 months,I could not afford to lose ALL of my sight! So, I had to wait. I could not drive like that either which made matters worse. Both my husband and I were in school fulltime (until then), fortunately it was the end of the semester, unfortunately it was BEFORE finals. My sight did come back but not for about 5 months. When it first started to come back I still couldn't drive because although I could see I did not have my peripheral vision, that did not fully come back for quite a while.

Obama dons Chinese silk jacket in cringeworthy photo shoot President Obama unintentionally looked a lot like “Star Trek: The Next Generation” character Jean-Luc Picard when he donned a maroon silk Chinese jacket to the APEC Summit, honoring his Chinese hosts while continuing a nearly 20-year tradition of disastrous fashion at the global conference. U.S. Presidents have Bill Clinton to thank for starting the innocuous custom - when he gifted dignitaries at the 1993 APEC Summit in Seattle with leather bomber jackets to wear for a conference photo. APEC hosts then picked up on the idea, subjecting leaders to embarrassing fashion shoots, all in the name of appreciation for the local attire. Many have praised President George W. Bush for rocking APEC fashion and being a good sport even when it came to questionable offerings like Vietnam’s silk tunics and Korea’s wrap gown. But Obama has proved less amenable to ditching his swagger for the sake of cultural sensitivity, though he did play along for his first summit in 2009 in Singapore. He dodged a bullet in 2010, when Japan opted not to force attendees into local garb. Then when he served as host for the event in 2011, he suspended the tradition. “I looked at pictures of some of the previous APEC meetings and some of the garb that appeared previously and I thought this might be a tradition that we might want to break,” he told reporters about sticking to business attire at the gathering held in Honolulu. In 2012, Obama sent Hillary Clinton to the APEC Summit and Secretary of State John Kerry went in his stead in 2013. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. President Obama donned a maroon silk Chinese jacket at the APEC Summit, continuing a nearly 20-year tradition of wearing local attire at the global conference. 2. The fashion tradition at the APEC Summit was started by former President Bill Clinton in 1993 when he gifted leather bomber jackets to dignitaries for a conference photo. 3. APEC host countries have since continued the custom, subjecting leaders to various local attire for photo shoots. 4. President George W. Bush was known for embracing the tradition, wearing garments such as silk tunics and wrap gowns from host countries. 5. Obama, on the other hand, has been less inclined to participate in the fashion tradition, suspending the custom when he hosted the event in 2011. 6. In 2012 and 2013, Obama sent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry to the APEC Summit, respectively, instead of attending himself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Felicia liked to fall asleep in silence while Rebecca preferred white noise; Choose your answer from: I. Felicia wore ear plugs to bed.; II. Rebecca wore ear plugs to bed.;","completion":"As two close friends, Felicia and Rebecca often spent countless nights talking and laughing with one another. While both appreciated their differences, they could not find common ground when it came to their sleeping preferences. Felicia liked to fall asleep in silence, while Rebecca preferred white noise to drift off into slumber. Despite this disparity, the two friends were committed to finding a solution that catered to both of their needs. They were aware of each other's preferences and wanted to ensure that neither had to compromise on their comfort. Felicia was initially hesitant about trying something new but made an effort to meet Rebecca halfway. After much deliberation and research, they decided that, out of the two options presented (I. Felicia wore ear plugs to bed; II. Rebecca wore ear plugs to bed), the best course of action was option I. Felicia wore ear plugs to bed. This decision was primarily influenced by Felicia's preference for silence. By wearing ear plugs, she could achieve her desired level of quietness, while Rebecca could still enjoy her familiar white noise. Moreover, they figured that the ear plugs would be less of an inconvenience for Felicia, as she could easily remove them once she had fallen asleep, without affecting Rebecca's sleeping pattern. Consequently, Felicia decided to give ear plugs a try and was pleased to find that they significantly improved her sleeping experience. They effectively blocked out the white noise generated by Rebecca's sound machine, allowing Felicia uninterrupted and peaceful sleep. They were especially useful during nights when Rebecca would stay up late watching TV or listening to music. Additionally, the ear plugs turned out to be an excellent investment, as they were not only reusable and comfortable but also came in handy during various situations, such as while traveling, at noisy events, or whenever Felicia needed to focus in a loud environment. The decision to have Felicia wear ear plugs to bed proved to be an effective and mutually beneficial solution for both friends. It allowed them to respect each other's preferences without causing any inconvenience or resentment. Their understanding and open-mindedness further strengthened their friendship and showcased the importance of adaptability and communication in maintaining harmonious relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

Look for signs of online impersonation.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Identifying and Combating Cyber Harassment: Recognizing the Signs, and Supporting Victims Introduction: The rapid growth of digital technology and the internet have dramatically impacted the way we communicate, making it easier for us to connect with people from around the world. However, this has also given rise to new forms of harassment, primarily occurring online. Online harassment, also known as cyber harassment or cyberbullying, affects millions of people around the world, and it can have damaging effects on the mental health and wellbeing of the victims. In order to mitigate the impact of online harassment and support those who have been targeted, it is crucial to recognize the signs and tactics used by cyber harassers. This article will discuss three key aspects of online harassment that we should be vigilant against: signs of harassment, public online humiliation, and online impersonation. 1. Recognizing signs of harassment: Online harassment can take many forms and affect people of all ages, backgrounds, and experiences. Common features of online harassment include abusive messages, threats, stalking, and spamming. The following are some of the signs to watch out for: - Unsolicited, offensive, and abusive messages or comments directed toward an individual - Persistent attempts to contact someone despite being ignored or blocked - Threats of violence, harm, or revealing personal information - Unwanted sexual advances or explicit content being shared without consent - Inciting others to harass or attack someone online When these signs are present, it is crucial to take action and report the abusive behavior to the relevant authority or platform. 2. Understanding public online humiliation: Another common tactic used by online harassers is public humiliation. This involves publicly shaming, embarrassing, or mocking a person in order to cause emotional distress. This can happen through various channels, like social media platforms, blogs, and forums. Some of the forms of public online humiliation include: - Sharing embarrassing photos, videos, or private conversations without consent - Spreading false rumors or accusations to tarnish someone's reputation - Posting offensive memes or derogatory content about a person - Using derogatory slurs or insults aimed at the target's race, gender, or sexual orientation If you or someone you know is experiencing public online humiliation, it is important to report the offending content to the platform it is posted on and gather evidence of the harassment to support your claims. 3. Detecting online impersonation: Online impersonation is when someone assumes the identity of another person, usually with malicious intent. This is often done to deceive others, gain unauthorized access to personal information, or cause embarrassment to the victim. Some of the telltale signs of online impersonation include: - Fake social media profiles that imitate or closely resemble the victim's account - Email addresses that look similar to the victim's but may have slight alterations - Messages that seem to be from the victim but contain unusual language or requests - New messages or requests from someone claiming to be the victim after they have deactivated or changed their account If you suspect that you or someone you know is being impersonated online, report the incident to the relevant platform, contact your local authorities, and inform your friends and family. Conclusion: Recognizing the signs of online harassment, public online humiliation, and online impersonation is essential for putting an end to these damaging behaviors. By being more aware of these tactics, we can create a safer online environment for all and provide support for those who have been affected by cyber harassment. Remember, if you witness or experience any of these signs, take action by reporting the behavior, gathering evidence, and seeking help from friends, family, or professionals if needed. Together, we can fight against cyber harassment and promote a culture of respect, empathy, and kindness online."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which mountain overlooks the city of Cape Town in South Africa?","completion":"The prominent mountain that majestically overlooks the city of Cape Town in South Africa is the iconic Table Mountain. This flat-topped mountain forms an unmistakable part of Cape Town's skyline and is one of the most famous and recognizable landmarks in the country as well as on the continent of Africa. The mountain stands tall at 1,085 meters (3,558 feet) above sea level, providing a breathtaking backdrop to the bustling city below. Table Mountain is an integral part of the Table Mountain National Park, which covers a vast area of the Cape Peninsula, protecting the region's rich biodiversity, stunning landscapes, and unique flora and fauna. The park is home to an incredible array of plant species, many of which cannot be found anywhere else on earth, making it an essential site for biodiversity conservation. Table Mountain's flat summit is composed primarily of hard, horizontally layered sandstone that resisted the erosive forces of wind and water over millions of years. Geologically, the mountain is part of the Cape Fold Belt, an extensive range of sandstone mountains that stretches along the southwestern coast of South Africa. The striking geological features of Table Mountain have made it a popular destination for geologists, researchers, as well as local and international tourists. The mountain boasts a rich history and cultural significance, with archaeological findings dating back thousands of years. The indigenous Khoisan people and the later Bantu-speaking groups were the first-known inhabitants of the region, followed by European explorers and settlers from the 17th century onwards. In addition to its beauty and ecological importance, Table Mountain offers a variety of leisure and recreational activities. Hiking is a popular pastime, with numerous trails traversing the mountain, catering to different levels of fitness and experience. Climbers and adventure enthusiasts can also partake in rock climbing and abseiling along its steep cliffs. For those seeking a more relaxed experience, the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway, established in 1929, transports visitors to the summit, providing stunning 360-degree panoramic views of Cape Town, the Atlantic seaboard, and the surrounding mountain ranges. Once at the top, visitors can enjoy facilities such as a restaurant, a gift shop, and numerous viewpoints to take in the majestic scenery. Because of its iconic status and its importance to the community and tourism industry, Table Mountain was declared one of the New7Wonders of Nature, following a global voting campaign in 2011. It serves as a symbol of Cape Town and South Africa's natural beauty, as well as being a key attraction for visitors from around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This marks a similar trajectory as in 2013, when Froome also won the event before going on to win the Tour de France later that year. Froome, a 30-year-old Kenya-born rider, is aiming for his second Tour title after crashing during the fifth stage the previous year. Regarding this year's Tour, which begins on July 4th, Froome has expressed confidence in his team's preparedness, as well as his own. BMC rider Van Garderen finished as runner-up in the Criterium, with Lampre's Rui Costa placing third. Orica-Green Edge's Simon Yates, a 22-year-old British rider, won the best young rider jersey, finishing fifth overall. In Sunday's stage, Yates finished second, followed by Costa in third place and Van Garderen in fourth. For context, last year's Tour de France winner, Italian Astana rider Vincenzo Nibali, struggled during Saturday's seventh stage, finishing 12th. In the Tour de Suisse, another Team Sky cyclist, Geraint Thomas, secured a fifth-place finish in the second stage, moving up to second place overall.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that the club owner hire a hit man to kill? from the following article ? In contemporary wartime San Francisco, chemist and blackmailer Albert Baker is killed by hit man Philip Raven, who recovers a stolen chemical formula. Raven is double-crossed by his employer, Willard Gates who pays him with marked bills and reports them to the Los Angeles Police Department as stolen from his company, Nitro Chemical Corporation of Los Angeles. Raven learns of the setup and decides to get revenge. LAPD detective lieutenant Michael Crane, who is vacationing in San Francisco to visit his girlfriend, nightclub singer Ellen Graham, is immediately assigned the case. He goes after Raven, but the assassin eludes him. Meanwhile, Gates hires Ellen to work in his LA nightclub after an audition where she sings and performs magic tricks. Then she is taken to a clandestine meeting with Senator Burnett, where she learns that Gates and Nitro Chemical are under investigation as suspected traitors, and is recruited to spy on Gates. Unknown to each other, she and Gates board a train for Los Angeles, followed by Raven. By chance, Raven and Ellen sit next to each other. The next morning, Gates is alarmed when he sees them asleep with Raven's head on her shoulder. He wires ahead to alert the police, but Raven forces Ellen at gunpoint to help him elude them again. He is about to kill her but is interrupted by workmen, allowing Ellen to flee. From Gates's club, she tries to contact Crane, but he has left San Francisco to return to LA.

Therefore, from this context, it is clear that Albert Baker is the individual whom Willard Gates hires a hit man to assassinate. To understand this in detail, let's break down the information provided: 1. Albert Baker is a chemist and a blackmailer existing in wartime San Francisco. 2. A hit man named Philip Raven is hired to retrieve a stolen chemical formula and assassinate Albert Baker. 3. The person who hires Raven is Willard Gates, a club owner who later double-crosses Raven. 4. Gates tricks Raven by paying him with bills marked as stolen from his company, Nitro Chemical Corporation, located in Los Angeles. 5. Learning about the set-up, Raven decides to seek revenge on Gates. From this information, we can deduce that the person the club owner hired a hit man to kill is Albert Baker."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.

Caused 3000 worth of damage . Darn it . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What will they do with the car","completion":"Based on the given passage, it seems that they have already identified the issues with the car, which include a cracked bumper, a damaged air condenser, a damaged rear-engine mount, and a shifted subframe. The total estimated cost of these damages is 3,000. Although the passage doesn't explicitly mention what they will do with the car, we can infer a few possible actions they might take, considering the context and the extent of the damage. 1. Repair the Car: The most likely course of action would be to get the car repaired, which would involve taking it to a trustworthy mechanic or an authorized dealer's workshop. They would then need to pay the 3,000 to have all the components fixed or replaced. This could be a good option if they believe the car is still worth investing in, have a strong attachment to it, or don't have the budget for a new vehicle at this time. 2. File an Insurance Claim: If they have comprehensive car insurance, they might consider filing a claim to cover the repair costs, minus their deductible. This would help them financially, as the insurance company would pay for the majority of the repair costs. However, this could potentially raise their insurance premiums in the future, and they would need to evaluate if it's worth filing a claim for this incident. 3. Sell the Car As-Is: Another option would be to sell the car in its current damaged state, possibly to someone who is interested in repairing it themselves or using it for spare parts. This would allow them to recoup some of the car's value but probably at a significantly lower price than if it were in good condition. If they decide to go this route, they might either use the money to invest in a new car or perhaps rely on public transportation, biking, or carpooling for their transportation needs. 4. Salvage the Car: If they determine that the car is not worth repairing or selling as-is, they could consider contacting a salvage yard that would be willing to purchase the car for its scrap value. The amount they receive would likely be minimal, but it would still enable them to dispose of the vehicle and move on from the unfortunate incident. After doing so, they may look into purchasing a new or used car to replace the damaged one, depending on their budget and preferences. In conclusion, while the passage does not explicitly state what they will do with the car, the logical steps based on the context and extent of the damage would involve repairing the car, filing an insurance claim, selling it as-is, or salvaging it. Ultimately, the decision will depend on various factors such as their budget, insurance coverage, and attachment to the vehicle."},{"prompt":"M: Well.

Plot title: Mother and Son Movie plot: The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail old woman. They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died. My question: Who is the old woman?

Article:The investigators have produced 13 reports, the evidence in each is harrowing. Villages destroyed, crops burnt, wells poisoned, torture, rape, starvation sieges, mass bombing of civilians, and what only a decade ago might have been unthinkable - chemical weapons. There is no doubt that war crimes have been committed by all sides, the commission says. In each report there is a demand for \\"accountability\\" - that no-one should be allowed to commit such horrific acts and get away with it. \\"This would be incredible, a scandal,\\" says commission member Carla Del Ponte, who describes the violations in Syria as by far the worst she has ever come across. \\"But nothing happens, only words, words, and more words.\\" Ms Del Ponte, as a former prosecutor at the tribunal for Yugoslavia, and the woman who put Slobodan Milosevic in the dock, knows how to bring war criminals to book. While the Syria commission has no power to prosecute, what it does have is a vast amount of evidence, and a confidential list of names, thought to include figures at the very top of the Syrian government and military. To bring those individuals (including, Ms Del Ponte thinks, President Assad) to court, the UN Security Council would have to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court. And throughout the Syria conflict, the Security Council has been divided, with Russia and China in particular resisting what they regard as unnecessary interference in Syria's problems. Now, though, the United Nations, under new Secretary General Antonio Guterres, appears to be flexing its muscles. A new body has been set up, called, rather dryly, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism or IIIM, to sift the evidence, build cases, and pass them to any court that could have jurisdiction. Some European countries are already opening cases. At its head is an experienced French judge, Catherine Marchi-Uhel, who has worked on the tribunal for former Yugoslavia, and the Extraordinary Courts of Cambodia, which prosecuted the Khmer Rouge. \\"This gives me hope that something is moving,\\" says Alain Werner, director of Civitas Maxima, a Swiss organisation that works to ensure justice for victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity. \\"I didn't even think this body would be set upâ€¦ this is proof [the UN] is serious.\\" Mr Werner's own organisation has already built cases against suspected war criminals from Sierra Leone and Liberia, and his work with victims has shown him, he says, that \\"the eagerness for justice is immense\\". One of his colleagues, Antonya Tioulong, knows personally just how important this can be. Her sister and brother-in-law were tortured and murdered in Phnom Penh's notorious S-21 detention centre during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In the 1990s, almost two decades after her sister's death, Antonya was able to learn what had happened to her, and she tried to bring a case in the French courts against the Khmer Rouge officers who had run S-21. It was rejected. \\"I felt powerless. There was no sign, either, of an international tribunal. I wondered, 'Were the two million victims of the Khmer Rouge genocide so unimportant in the eyes of the world that the criminals did not need to be judged?'\\" Antonya had to wait until 2008, when an international tribunal was finally set up. The men who murdered her sister were at last convicted. She was comforted not just by the verdict, but by the fact that the tribunal was public. \\"Thousands of people came from all over the world to attend the hearings in person, showing their desire to understand what happened.\\" But many thousands of victims still wait. In the Swiss capital, Berne, the Red Cross Centre for Victims of Torture and War had more than 4,000 consultations in 2016 alone. \\"Almost the most important thing is that they have the space and time to talk,\\" says psychologist Carola Smolenski. \\"We have patients from former Yugoslavia who still suffer chronically from their experiences.\\" For many of these patients, however, there may never be a public tribunal where perpetrators are convicted, and the suffering of their victims formally recognised in a court of law. Instead, the Red Cross Centre has included a form of \\"validation\\" process as part of the therapy. \\"We will prepare [together with the patient] a detailed chronological report,\\" says Carola Smolenski. \\"We recognise the experience together, and we sign it as witnesses.\\" \\"It is important that they can say, 'That is my story, and it is being taken seriously.'\\" For the millions of Syrians waiting in refugee camps, or trapped in besieged cities, peace cannot come soon enough. But millions of Syrians, too, are waiting to know the fate of loved ones who disappeared into Syria's prisons, or vanished in the heat of battle. In Geneva, the UN peace process is inching along. In the talks about Syria in the Kazakh capital, Astana, the Russians, Turks, and Iranians are working to negotiate \\"de-escalation zones\\" to reduce the violence. But in neither the Geneva process nor Astana is there much talk of accountability for the undoubtedly massive number of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is unclear whether the newly formed IIIM has a role in the peace process at all. Could this be because leaders, on all sides of Syria's conflict, might not be motivated to reach a peace deal if they thought a war crimes trial would be their reward? \\"You might have put your finger on it,\\" says one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. The idea that achieving peace, or at least an absence of war, should take priority over justice is often advanced during tricky diplomatic negotiations. Some also suggest that war crimes tribunals can sow the seeds of future discord, particularly if victims are from one ethnic group and perpetrators from another. Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu famously did not want a tribunal for South Africa, pushing instead for a truth and reconciliation process, in which the accused would acknowledge their crimes but also be forgiven by their victims. The UN's human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, agrees that creating sustainable peace is a complex process, but insists that the authors of Syria's suffering must be formally prosecuted. \\"In Syria, there will never be peace if you don't put the victims at the centre of your effort,\\" he says. \\"You can have the most finely crafted agreement, but if victims don't feel justice, then it is worthless, a pointless exercise. There has to be an accounting, the central authors must be brought to book.\\" Nevertheless, he sees prosecutions as only part of the process. \\"At a fundamental level, we will never have permanent peace if we don't deal with unresolved issues.\\" This means, he says, all sides in a conflict recognising their conduct, and showing \\"contrition\\". And there, Mr Hussein says, society must play its role. During the German trials after World War Two, he points out, there were 7,000 convictions, but few of those convicted showed any remorse. The push for contrition and remorse came later, through work by German historians, school teachers, and post-War politicians. Alain Werner agrees that, in view of the scale of the atrocities in Syria, \\"it is very difficult to think there will be no justice\\". But, he adds, because the number of cases is \\"staggering\\", justice is unlikely to be swift. \\"Syria could take 40 yearsâ€¦ even 100 years to investigate.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"This article talks about how bad things have happened during a war in Syria.

Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were \\"noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance\\", biographer David Buckley wrote that \\"Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation.\\" Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, \\"There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie\\".Musicologist James Perone credited Bowie with having \\"brought sophistication to rock music\\", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The Human League founder Martyn Ware remarked that he had lived his life \\"as though he were an art installation.\\" The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was \\"an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions\\". U2 lead singer Bono commented, \\"I like Bowie when he’s evenly pulled in the direction of being a pop star and Picasso, where he's right down the middle. That’s usually my favorite, when the songwriting is disciplined but the recording is not. I love when he's pulled equally in the directions of art and populism.\\"Broadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was \\"an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things\\". Peel said he \\"liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change\\". Buckley called the era \\"bloated,...

How many pints are there in a gallon?","completion":"There are 8 pints in a gallon. A gallon is a unit of measurement for volume commonly used in the United States as well as for certain industrial applications worldwide. There are two main types of gallons, the Imperial (UK) gallon and the US gallon. However, the US gallon is more commonly used when discussing pints. To clarify the conversions: 1 US gallon = 8 US pints 1 UK (Imperial) gallon = 8 UK (Imperial) pints Keep in mind that there's a difference between the US gallon and the UK (Imperial) gallon, as well as their respective subunits. To be more precise: 1 US gallon = 3.78541 liters 1 US pint = 473.176 milliliters 1 UK (Imperial) gallon = 4.54609 liters 1 UK (Imperial) pint = 568.261 milliliters So, while there are still 8 pints in a gallon in both measurement systems, the actual volume of a pint and a gallon differs depending on whether you are using the US or UK (Imperial) system of measurement. Since pints and gallons are mostly used in the United States, when people ask about the number of pints in a gallon, they are usually referring to the US measurement system, which gives us 8 US pints in 1 US gallon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Their investigation of a seamount more than 500km (300 miles) from the Canary Islands has revealed a crust of \\"astonishingly rich\\" rock. Samples brought back to the surface contain the scarce substance tellurium in concentrations 50,000 times higher than in deposits on land. Tellurium is used in a type of advanced solar panel, so the discovery raises a difficult question about whether the push for renewable energy may encourage mining of the seabed. The rocks also contain what are called rare earth elements that are used in wind turbines and electronics. Known as Tropic Seamount, the mountain stands about 3,000m tall â€“ about the size of one of the middle-ranging Alpine summits â€“ with a large plateau at its top, lying about 1,000m below the ocean surface. Using robotic submarines, researchers from the UK's National Oceanography Centre found that the crust is dark and fine-grained and stretches in a layer roughly 4cm thick over the entire surface of the mountain. Dr Bram Murton, the leader of the expedition, told the BBC that he had been expecting to find abundant minerals on the seamount but not in such concentrations. \\"These crusts are astonishingly rich and that's what makes these rocks so incredibly special and valuable from a resource perspective.\\" He has calculated that the 2,670 tonnes of tellurium on this single seamount represents one-twelfth of the world's total supply. And Dr Murton has come up with a hypothetical estimate that if the entire deposit could be extracted and used to make solar panels, it could meet 65% of the UK's electricity demand. He says he is not advocating deep-sea mining, which has yet to start anywhere in the world and is likely to be highly controversial because of the damage it could cause to the marine environment. But Dr Murton does want his team's discovery, part of a major research project called MarineE-Tech, to trigger a debate about where vital resources should come from. \\"If we need green energy supplies, then we need the raw materials to make the devices that produce the energy so, yes, the raw materials have to come from somewhere. \\"We either dig them up from the ground and make a very large hole or dig them from the seabed and make a comparatively smaller hole. \\"It's a dilemma for society - nothing we do comes without a cost.\\" Scientists are now weighing up the relative risks and merits of mining on land as opposed to on the seabed. Mines on land often require forests and villages to be cleared, overlying rocks to be removed and roads or railways to be built in order to extract ores with relatively weak concentrations of minerals. By contrast, mines on the seabed would extract far richer ores, covering a smaller area and with no immediate impact on people - but instead killing marine life wherever digging machines are deployed and potentially devastating a far wider area. One major concern is the effect of plumes of dust, stirred up by excavation of the ocean floor, spreading for long distances and smothering all life wherever it settles. To understand the implications, the expedition to Tropic Seamount conducted an experiment, the first of its kind, to mimic the effects of mining and to measure the resulting plume. Deploying from the UK research ship James Cook, a remotely operated vehicle deliberately pumped out hundreds of litres of sediment-filled water every minute while other robotic sensors were positioned downstream in the ocean current. According to Dr Murton, early results indicate that dust was hard to detect 1km away from the source of the plume, suggesting that the impact of mining could be more localised than many fear. But this comes as different disciplines within marine science are coming up with a range of perspectives on this emerging development. A study led by Dr Daniel Jones, also at the NOC, reviewed evidence of seabed exploration and found that in the wake of mining many marine creatures would be likely to recover within a year but that few would return to their previous levels even after two decades. Another study focused on tiny organisms on the floor of the Pacific Ocean in a region known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which stretches in a belt south of Hawaii. Much of this zone has been licensed by the UN's International Seabed Authority to companies from more than a dozen countries to search for minerals in the potato-sized rocks or \\"nodules\\" lying on the seabed. Prof Andy Gooday, also of the NOC, and colleagues found that among the metals-rich nodules, there is a far greater diversity of single-celled organisms called xenophyophores than previously thought. Their research identified as many as 34 species of these lifeforms that are new to science. These organisms occupy one of the lower rungs in the food chain and also play an important role by forming hard shell-like structures, like miniature coral reefs, that provide habitats for other creatures. Prof Gooday says that the range of life in the sediments of the deep ocean can be compared with that of a tropical rainforest and that \\"life on the ocean floor is more dynamic\\" than anyone expected. He believes it is unlikely that seabed mining would cause species to go extinct but that the impact locally would be severe. \\"If you eliminate these xenophyphores, which are very fragile and would certainly be destroyed by mining, it would destroy habitat structure for other organisms. \\"It's difficult to predict and, like everything in the deep sea connected with the effects of mining, we need to learn more â€“ we still know so little about what's going on down there.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about a big underwater mountain called Tropic Seamount, which has lots of very special rocks that contain a valuable material called tellurium.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: To where does Dr. Randy Olson travel? Movie plot title: Flock of Dodos Movie plot: Flock of Dodos examines the disagreements that proponents of intelligent design have with the scientific consensus position of evolution.[1] The evolutionarily famous dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is a now-extinct bird that lived on the island of Mauritius. Due to its lack of fear of humans and inability to fly, the dodo was easy prey, and thus became known for its apparent stupidity. The film attempts to determine who the real \\"dodos\\" are in a constantly evolving world: the scientists who are failing to effectively promote evolution as a scientifically accepted fact, the intelligent design advocates, or the American public who get fooled by the \\"salesmanship\\" of evolution critics. The film gives equal air time to both sides of the argument, including intelligent design proponent Michael Behe and several of his colleagues. While Randy Olson ultimately sides with the scientists who accept evolution, the scientists are criticized for their elitism and inability to efficiently present science to the general public, which ultimately contributes to the spread of misconceptions.[2] The film begins by going over the history of intelligent design thought from Plato and Paley to the present-day incarnation promoted by the Discovery Institute. Olson mixes in humorous cartoons of squawking dodos with commentary from his mother and interviews with proponents on both sides of the intelligent design/evolution debate. On the intelligent design side, Olson interviews Behe, John Calvart (founder of the Access Research Network) and a member of the Kansas school board.[3] Olson also unsuccessfully tries to interview Kansas Board of Education member Connie Morris (associated with Kansas evolution hearings) and members of the Discovery Institute.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Consuming a balanced and nutritious breakfast can provide your body with essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins required for the day. Additionally, a healthy morning meal can enhance cognitive functions and improve concentration, mood, and overall well-being. Different cultures and regions have various traditional jentacular (breakfast) foods. In North America and Europe, common items served for breakfast include eggs, bacon, sausages, pastries, cereal, yogurt, fruits, and beverages such as coffee, tea, and juice. Asian countries, for example, Japan and China, often serve rice, soup, and fish for breakfast. In India, breakfast may consist of flatbreads, vegetables, and savory pancakes called \\"dosa.\\" Eating a jentacular meal rich in protein, good fats, and whole grains helps maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the day, curbing cravings and preventing energy crashes.

Finally , because cap and trade affects all companies and minimises cost to them , it provides all companies with an incentive to work toward green technology . 2. Under the status quo , where subsidies and research grants are paid to businesses researching emissions reduction technology , the government has to decide which companies are best at solving the ecological damage that industry causes . 3. So , if a company takes action to reduce its carbon emissions below the designated level , than it can make a profit . 4. This is a powerful market incentive that is more likely to cause companies to invest money in finding ways to reduce their carbon emissions . 5. A cap-and-trade system provides companies with credits if they are able to reduce their emissions below an established level . 6. They can then sell these credits for a profit . 7. Within this mechanism , market prices would simply reflect the availability of credits . 8. As such , nations can guarantee a reduction in carbon emissions just by reducing the number of credits in the market . 9. A carbon tax , conversely , only provides the incentive of cutting costs , and does not offer this important profit motive . 10. With cap-and-trade emissions are much more likely to be meaningfully reduced , specifically because the cap is static and as such nations can choose to raise and lower it as they wish .","completion":"The sentences are talking about a system called cap-and-trade. This system helps companies want to use green technology by giving them a special reward called credits. These credits are given when companies make less pollution than they're allowed. They can then sell these credits to make money. This helps companies want to make even less pollution. Right now, the government gives money to some companies to help them make less pollution, but they have to choose who gets the help. With cap-and-trade, all the companies can join and try to make less pollution. This way, more companies work on finding ways to make less pollution and it helps the world be cleaner. This is better than another idea called a carbon tax, which only helps companies save money but doesn't give them the extra reward like cap-and-trade does. So, by changing how many credits there are in the market, countries can make sure there is less pollution because companies want to earn more credits and make more money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He employed this phrase in his work titled \\"Odes\\" (specifically, Book 1, Poem 11), which is a collection of lyric poems that broach various themes, such as love, religion, morality, patriotism, and personal experiences. \\"Carpe Diem\\" has since become an axiom that advocates living life to the fullest, pursuing opportunities, and making the most of the present moment before it becomes a thing of the past. This mindset encourages individuals to be decisive, proactive, and to seize opportunities that arise in their daily lives. In Horace's poem, Leuconoë, the phrase emphasizes the unpredictability of life, highlighting the importance of enjoying the present without worrying too much about the future. The concept of Carpe Diem has influenced literature, philosophy, and popular culture over the centuries. It has been used as a theme in various works by poets such as Robert Herrick, John Keats, and Lord Byron, among others. Additionally, the phrase has been adopted as a motto by numerous institutions and individuals who strive to instill a sense of urgency, productivity, and enthusiasm towards life's journey. Today, \\"Carpe Diem\\" continues to inspire people in different aspects of their lives, whether it is in setting personal goals, making choices, or tackling challenges. Overall, it serves as a powerful reminder to make the most of the limited time that we have, appreciating the transient nature of life and translating our aspirations into actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the 1830s an aboriginal is charged with the spearing of a white settler, but was about to be released by the Captain convinced of his innocence after questioning him. But, during a party that night, a drunken officer shoots and kills the prisoner, and is charged with his murder. Thomas Morland, the acting Attorney General, is sent to Newcastle to investigate. Captain Alcot wishes to keep on the good side of the land-hungry Carlton so they attempt to defend the drunken lieutenant who has shot a native. Neither believe the prisoner Jacko had anything to do with the murder of a white settler, since he was captured 60 miles away from the crime. So they bribe Sergeant Constantine, who arrested Jacko, into saying that the place of arrest was close to Newcastle. At a trial in Sydney, the lieutenant is charged with murder by the Acting Attorney-General.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which organizations said the death toll to be beyond 10,000?","completion":"Title: Unveiling the Organizations Reporting a Death Toll of Over 10,000 Introduction: The death toll is a statistic that often brings into light the magnitude of a catastrophic event, be it war, natural disasters, or pandemics. A death toll exceeding 10,000 indicates a significant loss of human life and is likely to resonate across the globe. As such, organizations have the crucial responsibility to record and report these deaths accurately. In an effort to answer the question, \\"Which organizations said the death toll to be beyond 10,000?\\", this article will present some reputable authorities that have reported death tolls exceeding 10,000 in various events around the world. Step 1: Identify the catastrophic events that surpassed 10,000 deaths In order to identify the organizations responsible for reporting death tolls above 10,000, we must first recognize the catastrophic events that have caused this much human loss. Some examples of such events include: - The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami - The 2010 Haiti earthquake - The Syrian Civil War - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic Step 2: Determine the organizations responsible for reporting the death tolls of these events With the events identified, we can now explore the organizations that declared the death toll to be beyond 10,000. The following institutions have done so: 1. United Nations (UN) The United Nations, being a global organization, often plays a role in providing humanitarian aid and reporting on catastrophic events worldwide. In the case of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the UN reported a death toll exceeding 230,000 across 14 countries. Similarly, the UN reported an estimate of 222,570 deaths following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. 2. World Health Organization (WHO) An agency within the United Nations, the World Health Organization specializes in international public health. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has been reporting and updating the death toll regularly. As of October 2021, COVID-related deaths have far exceeded 10,000, reaching over 4.9 million globally. 3. Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) Specifically focusing on the Syrian conflict, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is a UK-based organization monitoring human rights violations in Syria. To date, the organization has confirmed a death toll of more than 593,000 since the war began in March 2011. Conclusion: In summary, numerous reputable organizations have reported death tolls exceeding 10,000, including the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In instances of war, natural disasters, or pandemics, accurate and credible documentation of death tolls is crucial to understanding the severity of these events and addressing the humanitarian needs that result from such tragedies."},{"prompt":"Question: Title: Game won't start Review: Bought the game, installed it.

Question: James's parents felt that he was wasting his money, but they still let him put a coin where every weekend? Options: A. wishing well B. piggy bank C. eat cake D. change purse E. parking meter A:","completion":"A detailed and long answer to this question would consider each option and the context in which it applies, taking into account James's habits and preferences, as well as the parents' perspective on money management. Option A: Wishing Well Wishing wells are usually found in public places like parks and shopping centers, and people often throw coins into them to make a wish. In some cases, the collected money is donated to charities, and the act of throwing a coin into a wishing well can become a fun and whimsical tradition. However, James's parents believe he is wasting his money, and it's likely they would not encourage him to put coins into a wishing well regularly, as this might be seen as an unnecessary and unproductive expense. Option B: Piggy Bank A piggy bank is a small container, typically shaped like a pig, for collecting coins and saving money. This option seems to align with common sense, as James's parents are concerned about his spending habits and would want him to develop a savings mindset. By depositing money into a piggy bank every weekend, James can slowly accumulate funds that can later be used for more important purposes or emergencies, promoting responsible money management. Option C: Eat Cake This option does not make logical sense in the context of the question. Eating cake is an activity rather than a place to deposit money. It is unrelated to saving or spending money, and therefore cannot be considered a valid option in answering the question. Option D: Change Purse A change purse is a small bag or pouch used to carry coins and small amounts of money. Though this item could be used to store James's money temporarily, it does not serve the same purpose as a piggy bank or wishing well, for it is meant as a convenient way to carry change when out and about. Since the question asks about where James puts a coin every weekend and his parents' concern is about saving money, this option does not seem to align with common sense. Option E: Parking Meter A parking meter is a device used to collect payment for parking in public spaces. Depositing coins into a parking meter every weekend would not be a sensible solution for saving money or addressing James's wasteful spending. The act of putting money into a parking meter has a specific purpose – to pay for parking – and it would likely be considered another frivolous expense by James's parents. In conclusion, the option that aligns with common sense in the context of the question is Option B, the piggy bank. Putting coins into a piggy bank every weekend will encourage James to save money and adopt more responsible spending habits, which addresses his parents' concern about his money management skills. Additionally, this option serves a specific and practical purpose, unlike the others, which might be deemed wasteful or irrelevant to the parents' goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. It sounds simple, but changing what you ingest daily can have a huge impact on your anxiety levels. If you notice yourself feeling anxious, panicky, or stressed every day, plan to implement at least one of these dietary changes. Rethink your consumption of the following common anxiety provokers: Coffee. The most popular “energy drink” of all time may also be one of the leading causes of anxiety. If you drink coffee every morning, try switching to decaffeinated tea or just water for a few weeks. It may be hard to give up, but chances are you’ll see a reduction in your stress levels over this period of time. Sugar and starch. People often see eating sugary and starchy treats (like ice cream, cookies, or pasta) as an option for stress reduction, since comfort foods temporarily provide a feeling of calm. However, the rise and fall of blood sugar that occurs after eating these foods can actually cause emotional strain and stress. Alcohol. After a stressful day at work, many unwind over a few drinks. Alcohol makes stress feel far away in the moment, but the after-effect cancels out the temporary sense of relaxation. Drink sparingly, and when you do drink, make sure to hydrate to reduce the chance of getting a very stressful hangover. In functional medicine, anxiety is believed to be caused by inflammation of the central nervous system. This inflammation stems from the gut, so changing your diet may lead to a reduction in anxiety. Keeping yourself healthy with a balanced diet can go a long way toward stabilizing your mood. If you’re getting the right nutrients, your body will be better able to ward off anxiety during stressful situations. To avoid the negative mental-health effects of coffee, alcohol, and sugar, try replacing these foods with fruits and vegetables. Consume more foods high in antioxidants such as blueberries and acai berries. These help to raise mood levels and lower the hormones responsible for stress. Try foods that are high in Vitamins D, B, and E, such as eggs, almonds, and salmon. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as walnuts or flax seeds, may also help. Foods high in minerals like magnesium, such as whole grains (pasta and bread), maca root, and seaweed. Most people do not get the recommended amount of magnesium which can result in a variety of symptoms, including anxiety. Foods and drinks that have GABA, a type of neurotransmitter that increases sleep and relaxation, should be consumed on a regular basis. Some of these include kefir (a cultured dairy product), kimchi, and oolong tea. Studies have shown that regular exercise relieves symptoms of everyday anxiety and also helps to treat anxiety disorders. It improves feelings of well-being both while you’re exercising and for hours afterward. Cardiovascular exercises such as running or biking as well as weight training and other muscle-building exercises all serve the purpose of reducing anxiety. Consider giving yoga a try. The soothing atmosphere of yoga studios, and the chance to be quiet and internally-focused for an hour or so, make this physical activity particularly conducive to calming anxiety. If the thought of exercising itself makes you anxious, try incorporating low-impact physical activity into your routines. You don’t have to play a team sport or join a gym to get enough exercise; simply walking around your neighborhood can go a long way toward boosting your mood every day. Breathing deeply and slowly will immediately decrease your stress level. Most people practice shallow chest breathing, drawing breath into their lungs and exhaling at a rapid rate. When we’re feeling stressed, we tend to breathe even more quickly, which stresses us out even more. Instead, focus on breathing from your diaphragm or belly. Your stomach should balloon up. Breathing deeply and slowly will draw in more air than breathing through the lungs would, and also helps decrease your blood pressure, relax your muscles, and calm you down. Try breathing in for a count of 4, holding for a count of 3, and breathing out for a count of 4. Keeping your total number of breaths to 8 or less in one minute will help to immediately reduce anxiety levels. Often, anxiety builds up when you don’t get a chance to detox from life’s problems. Take at least ten minutes during your day to practice a hobby or pastime which brings you peace. This may be reading, playing sports, playing music, or making art. Giving yourself an outlet will help to remove the anxiety from your mind both immediately and in the long run. If you have a little free time, look into taking a new class in a field of interest to you. If you love jewelry, look into a local ring making class. If you’ve always wanted to learn a new language, start taking lessons from a local teacher or audit a language class at a local community college. During the times that you are doing your favorite things, make a conscious decision to avoid thinking about your stressors. Removing them from your thoughts will allow you to enjoy your activity much more, and help prevent future ruminations. Do whatever it is that helps you relax in a healthy way. There's no one right way to de-stress, everyone is different. When you’re at home you should be totally anxiety free. Your home, and the people you love, should be your sanctuary. When you are dealing with a lot of anxiety, take some time and relax at home. Make sure that you give yourself ample time to spend with those closest to you, in happy and non-stressful scenarios. Take a hot bath, listen to calming music, and avoid anything that might worsen your anxiety. If you’re not around anyone at your home, call a friend, or ask someone to come over. It can be comforting to spend time with people you love. Talk to a family member or friend about how you’re feeling. Say something like, “I’ve been very anxious lately, and it’s been preventing me from feeling happy. Do you ever feel this way?” Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to your anxiety. The best way to increase your Vitamin D is to go outside in the sun for at least fifteen minutes a day. You can also take Vitamin D supplements if necessary. If you keep a busy schedule, bring work back with you from the office, and stress about perfecting your school papers, you’re likely often overwhelming yourself and creating more anxiety than is necessary. Keep a schedule of your necessary activities and cut everything else out for a bit. Giving yourself alone time to deal with your anxiety will help you to overcome it in the long run. Although getting together with friends regularly is always nice, doing it too often can cause anxiety about letting them down and not having time to yourself. Spread out friend dates with plenty of time for yourself in between. Learn to say “no” to some requests. Whether it be another commitment from work or piling on errands, turning down invites is okay from time to time. A lack of sleep can leave anyone feeling haggard and worn out, and it’s worse for individuals who suffer from anxiety. Insufficient sleep can cause your anxious, worried thoughts to worsen. Make sure that you’re getting 7–9 hours of sleep every night. Try going to bed and waking up at the same times every day. This will help to regulate your sleep cycle, which will help you to get better nights of sleep. If you’re having a hard time falling or staying asleep, try using melatonin supplements. Melatonin is a hormone your body creates to help you fall asleep. You can buy the hormone in low dose pills from most health food stores. Avoid using your phone, laptop, and television in the hour before you go to bed. These devices can inhibit healthy sleep and prevent proper melatonin production in your body because of the bright light they put off. Summary:","completion":"To reduce anxiety levels, consider making dietary and lifestyle changes. Replace coffee, alcohol, and sugar with fruits, vegetables, and foods high in antioxidants, vitamins D, B, and E, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and GABA. Engage in regular exercise, such as cardiovascular workouts, weight training, or yoga. Practice deep, slow breathing, and incorporate calming activities or hobbies into your daily routine.

Question: Who did Sam hire to impersonate Gloria? Title: Body Double Movie plot: Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a struggling actor who has lost his role as a vampire in a low-budget horror movie after his claustrophobia thwarts shooting. After returning home to discover his girlfriend cheating on him, he is left without a place to stay. At a method acting class he meets Sam (Gregg Henry) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's friend has left town temporarily and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the Hollywood Hills. During the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially ecstatic about one feature: a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle (Deborah Shelton), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Sam has even set up a telescope which Scully cannot resist using voyeuristically to watch her. One night he sees Gloria being abused by a boyfriend. When she goes shopping the next day, Scully decides to follow her. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \\"Indian,\\" a man he had noticed watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows her to a seaside motel where apparently Gloria has been stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach the Indian suddenly snatches her purse.

Pick your answer from: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no","completion":"The answer is --no. The reason for this is because the information provided in the first statement describes a very specific situation. In the conveyed scenario, \\"A man [is] dressed as an Indian with two dogs standing and talking to a group of people by some hay.\\" This clearly suggests that the man is engaged in an active scenario, possibly partaking in some kind of public event or a gathering where he is dressed as an Indian, accompanied by his two dogs, and conversing with other people around him. The second statement, \\"The man is laying on a couch watching television\\", presents an entirely different context. This scenario suggests a more relaxed, passive situation, most probably indoors and in private. Here, the man is depicted as resting or reclining on a couch and occupied by what he is watching on television. The two scenes paint two significantly different activities and situations. There's no logical continuity from the man talking in an animated crowd to the same man lying alone on a couch watching television. The stated scenarios occur in entirely different settings (outdoors vs. indoors), present contrasting levels of activity (active engagement vs. passive watching), and even show a notable difference in wardrobe (dressed as an Indian vs. presumably casual home wear). Therefore, it does not logically follow from the first scenario that the man would then be found in the situation described by the second statement. As there is no continuity or logical connection between the two statements, we can confidently conclude that one situation does not necessarily lead to the other based on the given information.

They were opposed in this by French authorities, who continued to encourage the conflict, but Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Dummer announced a cessation of hostilities on 31 July 1725 following negotiations in March.:83 The terms of this preliminary agreement were negotiated by Dummer and Chiefs Loron and Wenemouet and applied only to the Penobscots at first. They were allowed to retain Jesuit priests, but the two parties were in disagreement concerning land titles and British sovereignty over the Wabanakis. The written agreement was translated into Abenaki by French Jesuit Etienne Lauverjat; Chief Loron immediately repudiated it, specifically rejecting claims of British sovereignty over him. Despite his disagreement, Loron pursued peace, sending wampum belts to other tribal leaders, although his envoys were unsuccessful in reaching Gray Lock, who continued his raiding expeditions. Peace treaties were signed in Maine on 15 December 1725 and in Nova Scotia on 15 June 1726, involving a large number of tribal chiefs. The peace was reconfirmed by all except Gray Lock at a major gathering at Falmouth in the summer of 1727; other tribal envoys claimed that they were not able to locate him.

These data points are interconnected, all relating to cultural and linguistic aspects of Russia, the largest country in the world. Russia, officially the Russian Federation, is a transcontinental country spanning Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. Covering an area of 17,125,191 square kilometers, Russia is the largest country in the world in terms of land area. It is home to a diverse population of approximately 146 million people, belonging to various ethnic groups and speaking a variety of languages. The Russian Federation comprises 85 federal subjects, including 22 republics, each with its own official languages and cultures alongside Russian. Russia shares borders with 14 different countries, and its extensive cultural and historical heritage has left a significant impact on its languages, traditions, and customs. Language, in general, is a complex system of communication used by humans to express thoughts, emotions, and information through the use of arbitrary symbols, such as speech, writing, or non-verbal gestures. It plays a crucial role in connecting individuals and societies and serves as the basis for social interactions, education, and cultural identity. There are over 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, with many featuring intricate rules and structures, including grammar, syntax, phonology, and vocabulary. The Russian language, specifically, is an East Slavic language that belongs to the larger Indo-European language family. It serves as the official language of Russia and is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. With approximately 258 million speakers globally, Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world and the second most widely used among the languages native to Europe, after English. The modern Russian language has its roots in the Old East Slavic language spoken by the Eastern Slavs during the 9th to 13th centuries and evolved through several stages, including Old Russian, Middle Russian, and eventually Modern Russian. Russian uses the Cyrillic script, which was developed in the 9th century by the brothers Saints Cyril and Methodius, based on the Greek alphabet. The Russian alphabet comprises 33 letters, with both upper and lower case forms. Russian grammar is complex, featuring six grammatical cases, two noun genders (masculine and feminine), and a neutral gender for inanimate objects. The language also consists of a rich vocabulary with distinct loanwords from various languages, such as French, German, English, and Tatar, owing to the historical influences of trade, politics, and cultural exchange. In summary, the data provided reflects the interconnection between the vast and culturally rich nation of Russia and the Russian language, which serves as the official language and an essential component of the country's identity. Representing a deep-rooted history and linguistic complexity, the Russian language plays a significant role in the cultural and social lives of its speakers, both within and outside of Russia's borders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stevens reveals that he's leaving town, and, believing his wife Leonetta to be in immediate danger, asks Rico to check on her.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"When a person is hungry and as a result, more food enters the body, the supposed perturbation would be considered as directly impacting a step of the process. To better understand this, let's analyze the process step-by-step and identify the direct impact: 1. Food enters the body: More food entering the body is a direct consequence of hunger. This directly impacts the first step of the process, as it is responsible for the initial intake of food. 2. Food begins to be processed by the digestive system: The increased amount of food entering the body will have a direct impact on the digestive system since it will have to work harder and potentially for a longer time to process the food and break it down into nutrients and energy. 3. The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion: The pancreas will also be directly impacted by the larger quantity of food coming in, as it will have to release more enzymes to support the digestive process. This increased demand for enzymes corresponds directly to the increased amount of food being consumed. 4. Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood: Since more food is being consumed and digested, the blood sugar levels will be directly affected. A larger quantity of digested food will lead to more glucose being absorbed into the blood, potentially causing a spike in blood sugar. 5. The pancreas releases one hormone to lower the blood sugar (glucose) level: As a direct response to the increased amount of glucose in the blood, the pancreas will release more insulin to help lower blood sugar levels. Insulin is responsible for facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, which regulates blood sugar levels. 6. The pancreas releases another hormone to raise the blood sugar (glucose) level: When the blood sugar levels are regulated and the body has absorbed the excess glucose, the pancreas might release a hormone called glucagon, which helps to raise blood sugar levels by stimulating the conversion of stored glycogen into glucose. This step might not be directly impacted by the increased food intake but is an important part of maintaining overall glucose homeostasis. In conclusion, when a person is hungry and consumes larger quantities of food, it directly impacts most steps of the process, from the initial food intake to the regulation of blood sugar levels. The impact on the digestive and endocrine systems demonstrates the interconnected nature of these processes and shows how the increase in food consumption can directly influence the resulting outcomes."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer a question about this article: A third concern with the Kinsey scale is that it inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality on the same scale, making one a tradeoff of the other. Research in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity found that concepts of masculinity and femininity are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on a separate scale rather than as a single continuum, with each end representing opposite extremes. When compared on the same scale, they act as tradeoffs such, whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa. However, if they are considered as separate dimensions one can be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine. Similarly, considering heterosexuality and homosexuality on separate scales would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either. When they are measured independently, the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined, rather than the balance between heterosexual and homosexual as determined using the Kinsey Scale. What happens if the concepts are measured on the same scale?","completion":"If the concepts are measured on the same scale, it's like having a seesaw. When one side goes up, the other side goes down. So, if you become more of one thing (like more heterosexual), you have to be less of the other (less homosexual). It makes them tradeoffs of each other. But if we measure them on separate scales, it's like having two different slides, where you can be high or low on both at the same time. This allows people to be a mix of both concepts, rather than just being one or the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Because Earth and the Sun exhibits less gravitational pull than that of Krypton, and also due to his solar-powered body, the Man of Steel can also alter his personal mono-directional gravity field to propel himself through the air at will. Originally, he only had the power to jump great distances, as stated by the 1940s Superman cartoons slogan \`\`Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.'' This was also shown in the movie Man of Steel. His power of flight has ranged from simply being able to jump great distances using his vast strength, to beginning in late 1941 being able to accelerate, float in midair, and change direction while traveling. Later he became able to traverse interstellar distances without stopping.

This power was often referred to as \\"able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\\" Over time, his flight abilities evolved, and he became able to not only jump with enormous strength but also manipulate his personal mono-directional gravity field to propel himself through the air, accelerate, float, change direction, and even traverse interstellar distances. While his more advanced flight abilities also involve manipulation of gravity, the basis of his flight capability is still rooted in his exceptional strength, especially in the context of Earth and the Sun exhibiting less gravitational pull than that of Krypton."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Article: A road rage incident in California turned violent Sunday night when someone fired a single shot into a moving car, striking a pregnant woman in the eye, authorities said Monday. The woman, 18, is three months’ pregnant and remains in critical condition, while the condition of her baby is unknown, according to the Fresno County sheriff’s department. Authorities are still looking for the suspect. On Sunday night, the woman was a passenger while her husband, 26, drove near the border between Fresno and Tulare counties, authorities said. Her husband passed another SUV that was driving slowly, but eventually that driver caught up to the couple and someone inside that SUV fired a single shot through the driver’s side window and struck the woman in the eye. “The confrontation appears to have been unprovoked by the husband and wife, so it’s unclear why someone in the suspect’s vehicle resorted to an act of violence,” reads a statement from the sheriff’s department. After the woman was shot, her husband turned around, pulled off to the side of the road and asked someone to call 911, the sheriff’s department said. A police officer in Tulare County escorted the husband as he drove his wife to the hospital; she was eventually airlifted for an emergency surgery. The shot came from a light brown SUV with at least two people inside that’s been described to authorities as a 2006 to 2012 Chevy Tahoe, Chevy Suburban or GMC Yukon.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the English artist whose portraits of male nudes were generally well received? from the following article ? William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David (Will McMillan), his girlfriend, nurse Judy (Lane Carroll), and firefighter Clank (Harold Wayne Jones). David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks, arrive in town, led by Major Ryder (Harry Spillman), who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying an untested bioweapon crash-landed in the hills near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \\"Trixie,\\" causing victims to either die or become homicidal. \\"Trixie\\" is highly contagious, with anyone drinking from the Evans City reservoir becoming affected.

In order to do that, we'll first isolate the term with the x in it on one side of the equation. We'll first subtract 239 from both sides of the equation to eliminate it on the right side. That will give us: 73 + 239 = -39x - 239 + 239 312 = -39x So, the task is to solve this new equation for x: 312 = -39x. To find the value of x, we just need to get rid of the -39 that is currently being multiplied by x. In order to do that, we'll divide both sides of this equation by -39: 312 / -39 = -39x / -39 That simplifies to: -8 = x So, the solution to the equation 73 = -39x - 239 is x = -8. This means that if you substitute -8 for x into the original equation, you should get a true statement. Let's check it: 73 = -39*(-8) - 239 73 = 312 - 239 73 = 73 And that verifies that our solution is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: FOX Sports on MSN Logic tells you Tiger Woods has no shot to win the U.S. Open. In fact, it appears a shirtless and shoeless John Daly will be offered a full membership at Augusta National before Woods returns from a two-month layoff to seize his 14th major title. He hasn't played a competitive round since Sunday at the Masters. He had surgery on a left knee that had been surgically altered in the past. He admitted Tuesday he hasn't felt strong enough and steady enough to walk a full 18 holes. So Woods stands a better chance of missing the Open cut like he did at Winged Foot two years back than he does of winning a national championship he hasn't won since taking Bethpage Black in 2002. That's why a triumph over the field at Torrey Pines this weekend will represent Tiger's greatest victory of all. It doesn't matter that a whole lot of smart money will be bet on Tiger despite his injury, or that Tiger has won at Torrey half a dozen times, including once after his first surgery. Truth is, Tiger's never won at Torrey under grueling U.S. Open conditions, and grueling U.S. Open conditions have historically taken something of a toll on Woods. We're not talking about his withdrawal as an amateur in '95, after injuring his wrist and wounding his psyche in the Shinnecock rough. We're talking about the fact Woods has won his fewest Grand Slam events while playing under USGA law. Tiger's taken four Masters, four PGA Championships, three British Opens, and two U.S. Opens. Yes, he did make a complete mockery of Pebble Beach in 2000, winning by a Secretariat margin (15 strokes) and all but declaring right then and there that he'd become the first man to win more than four Open titles. But eight years later, Tiger would settle for a third. The U.S. Open demands something that Woods doesn't always deliver  namely, driving accuracy. It offers targets so tight, greens so fast and rough so penal that it's often called the most trying test in golf. Sandwiched between his Open losses to Michael Campbell (at Pinehurst) and Angel Cabrera (at Oakmont), Woods tried a different kind of comeback at the 2006 Open at Winged Foot. His father, Earl, had died of cancer in early May, and Tiger had called him \\"an amazing dad, coach, mentor, soldier, husband and friend.\\" Playing with a broken heart, and competing for the first time since the Masters, Woods missed his very first Grand Slam cut as a pro, hitting only seven of 28 fairways on his way out the door. On a certain level, Tiger paid a perfect Father's Day tribute to his old man. He couldn't play his game without Earl around to see it, to hear about it, to break it all down. Woods has maintained that this Open comeback at Torrey Pines isn't in the same ballpark as that one at Winged Foot. He was dealing with emotional trauma back then; this time the pain is far more manageable. \\"All the things I had to go through and my preparation for tournaments, my dad taught me all those things,\\" Woods said. \\"Overcoming and getting out and playing and practicing, I didn't want to do that because I'd always think about dad. That was the hardest thing. \\"This (injury) is totally different ... You can't compare the two mentally. They're two totally different places.\\" Tiger isn't dealing with the loss of his best friend, just with the nuisance that is a bum knee. But still, golf is a game that puts a premium on repetition and focus. You're not supposed to be able to win the U.S. Open if you've been on the couch for two months watching the NBA playoffs and slapping around a few range balls on your rec-room putting green in between trips to the fridge. Not even if your name is Eldrick \\"Tiger\\" Woods. \\"I'm good to go,\\" Tiger declared. \\"I plan on playing competitive. Come gametime on Thursday, I'll be ready.\\" Tiger admitted that his left knee remains \\"a little sore,\\" yet he's been practicing at Torrey Pines and showing no signs of a body in disrepair. Jordan Cox, an amateur from Stanford, Tiger's old school, played with Woods the other day and was quoted saying, \\"I don't think the surgery affected him at all. He's hitting it really, really well right now.\\" Only it's one thing to play nine pressure-free holes with assorted friends and star-struck hopefuls, quite another to go 72 holes in major championship conditions. Sure, if anyone can reduce the surgery and the layoff to non-factors, Tiger Woods is the man. But the odds are stacked against him. They're stacked high enough to make Torrey Pines the potential scene of his most unlikely and most rewarding victory. To date, Tiger's greatest major triumph is a tossup between Pebble Beach and his breakthrough victory at the Masters in '97, when he introduced himself to the general public by reducing Augusta National to a pitch-and-putt and shattering every record and barrier in sight. There is the Tiger Slam, of course, and the defining shot of his career  that magic carpet ride of a chip-in at Augusta's 16th hole. But everything gets trumped the moment Woods raises the Open trophy high above his head at Torrey Pines. Will it happen? I don't think so. Though I believe Woods will play better than he did at Winged Foot and make the cut, I would be surprised if he's in serious contention on the Sunday back nine. Under the circumstances, he's the only golfer on the planet who would be given any chance at all. So a victory at the Open would be the closest thing to a signature major like the one Tiger's only true rival, Jack Nicklaus, claimed at the '86 Masters. Logic tells you it isn't going to happen. But then again, logic has never been a club in Tiger Woods' bag.","completion":"Despite significant obstacles in Tiger Woods' path to winning the U.S. Open, such as his lack of competitive play and recent knee surgery, a win at Torrey Pines would represent his greatest victory. Historically, Woods has struggled at the U.S. Open due to the demanding course conditions. Additionally, golf requires consistency and focus, which may be challenging since he has been out of play for an extended period. The odds are stacked against Woods, but if he were to triumph, it would be his most unlikely and rewarding victory."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The essential oils used most commonly for sinus infections are: Eucalyptus Menthol Lavender Sweet basil Oregano Rosemary Peppermint Tea tree Rose geranium Pine Clove Lemon Chamomile In a small bowl, add 1 and 1/2 cups of very warm (but not so hot that you scald your nasal tissues) distilled water, 6 tablespoons of finely ground unprocessed sea salt, and nine to 10 drops of essential oils, if you're using them. Stir the mixture well to dissolve the salt. Add the liquid to your Neti pot and let it cool before using. If you'd like to use more than one kind of essential oil, just be sure to use an equal number of drops so that the total number of drops equals nine or 10. Sea salt protects your nasal tissues. Never use tap water or water that hasn't been filtered, distilled, or sterilized by boiling for at least one minute. . Bend forward over a sink and tilt your head to one side. Breathe through your mouth to close your nose and throat off from the solution. Insert the neti pot spout into your upper nostril and slowly pour the solution so that it runs through and out of your lower nostril. Use half of the solution. Repeat this process with the other nostril and use the rest of the solution. Blow your nose when you're finished to get the remaining fluid out of your nose. If you don't have a Neti pot or don't feel comfortable using one, try a simple nasal saline spray, available at any pharmacy.

Use the saline spray to keep your sinuses hydrated while you are on the go. Irrigating your sinuses using a Neti pot is more effective in treating sinusitis than a nasal spray, but it can be intimidating at first. You may want to begin with a spray and gradually move to the Neti pot. Nasal saline sprays have the benefit of being ultra portable. Throw one in your purse or bag or keep one at work. If more than one member of your family has a sinus infection, consider using a diffuser. This will dispense essential oils throughout a room. Anyone with a sinus infection should sit as close as possible to the diffuser. Choose an essential oil and follow the manufacturer's instructions on your machine. Most diffusers suggest using 1/2 cup of water with three to five drops of essential oils.","completion":"The article discusses the use of essential oils and aromatherapy in combination with saline solutions, such as in a Neti pot or nasal spray, for the treatment of sinus infections, highlighting various essential oils and techniques for their application and offering alternative methods using diffusers and nasal saline sprays."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are the steps I took to analyze the review and come to this conclusion: 1. I read the title: \\"NONE OF THEM WORKED!!! DO NOT BUY!\\" - The reviewer is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the product and warning others not to buy it. This suggests a negative tone. 2. I examined the content of the review: The reviewer mentions that they purchased the product for their dog's laser pointer, but the batteries did not last longer than 3 minutes. This highlights a performance issue with the product, which is a negative aspect. 3. The reviewer also advises caution by saying, \\"Beware do not buy!!\\" - This further emphasizes the unflattering depiction of the product, as the reviewer is actively discouraging others from purchasing it. 4. The reviewer is thankful for only buying one package instead of multiple, implying that they consider it a waste of money and are relieved they did not spend more on the product.

Question: \\"When did the German army begin removing Jews from France?\\" Context: \\"On 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an \\"open city\\". On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the Vel d'Hiv (Vélodrome d'Hiver), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back. On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris, and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville.\\" Answer:","completion":"The German army began removing Jews from France during the Holocaust after they marched into Paris on June 14, 1940. Paris was declared an \\"open city,\\" and during this period of occupation, the German forces and their collaborators implemented various anti-Semitic policies that severely targeted the Jewish population in France. One of the most notorious incidents of this persecution was the Vel d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du Vélodrome d'Hiver). On July 16-17, 1942, under the direction of German authorities, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children. The reasons behind these arrests ranged from being listed in the Jewish registry, which was established in France in 1940, to simple suspicion of Jewish identity or activities against the occupation regime. The detained Jews were initially confined for five days at the Vel d'Hiv, a large sports stadium in Paris. The appalling conditions at the stadium only worsened the situation, as thousands of people suffered from a lack of food, water, and proper sanitation facilities. Despite this, the worst was yet to come. After the five-day confinement, the Jews detained at the Vel d'Hiv were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz, where they were subjected to forced labor, dehumanization, and brutality. The majority of those sent to Auschwitz faced systemic extermination. Tragically, none of the children who were removed from France during this roundup survived the Holocaust. The tide began to turn when the Liberation of Paris took place on August 25, 1944, led by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the United States Army's 4th Infantry Division. The French leader Charles de Gaulle spearheaded a massive, emotional procession down the Champs Élysées towards the Notre Dame de Paris, symbolizing the return of French sovereignty and hope for the future. From the Hôtel de Ville, de Gaulle delivered an impassioned speech, commemorating the sacrifices made by the French people during the occupation and rallying the nation to continue fighting for freedom. In conclusion, the German army began removing Jews from France after they occupied Paris in June 1940. The most infamous example of this persecution was the Vel d'Hiv Roundup in July 1942, during which nearly 13,000 Jews were arrested and ultimately sent to extermination camps like Auschwitz. The City of Light would not be liberated until August 1944, but this marked the beginning of the end for the German forces and their collaborators who had terrorized the Jewish population in France and other occupied territories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.

Ava was truly a vision to behold, her golden gown embellished with sapphire accents that highlighted her delicate features and mesmerizing blue eyes. The way the dress hugged her slender figure and flowed behind her like an enchanting wave of silk only added to her ethereal beauty. She navigated the room seamlessly, exchanging pleasantries with acquaintances and gracefully accepting compliments as she went. However, her gaze never lingered for long, perpetually searching, waiting for that one particular person she sought the most - him. It was a secret that they had shared, a mutual attraction that transcended the passing glances and casual conversations they had exchanged amid the lavish parties they frequented. It was a magnetic pull they both felt, as if drawn together by some unseen force that only they could perceive. Within the veiled world of high society, their connection was an exhilarating and dangerous game that they played, their hearts pounding in unison with every stolen glance and subtle caress.

The sound of the orchestra receded to a distant hum as, in unison, they lifted their glasses in a silent toast to the bond they shared - a bond that nobody would ever suspect. They offered furtive smiles, both acknowledging the hidden meaning and depths of emotion behind this simple gesture. As the night wore on, they continued their delicate dance, narrowly avoiding suspicion as they managed to steal fleeting moments together. With each shared smile, whispered word, and gentle touch, their feelings grew stronger and more undeniable, the love they nurtured blossoming secretly in a hidden corner of their souls. But as the last echoes of music faded into silence, and the guests began to depart, they knew it was time to say goodbye. They hesitated, the lingering warmth of each other's hands unwilling to be relinquished. But with a final, tender glance and a promise of stolen moments to come, they released each other and disappeared into the night, leaving only their stirring hearts and undying love as evidence of their passion. And so, amidst the opulence and glamour of a forgotten night, a love story began to unfold; one that would forever intertwine their destinies and paint the world around them with the brilliance of gold and shimmering sapphire.

Article: Organic food, once considered something that only health fanatics desired, is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. Conventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Almost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \\"no-aging\\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion. One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better... Question: It can be inferred from the passage that _ .

What happens if the capacitor can handle maximum amount of reversal?, Context: For maximum life, capacitors usually need to be able to handle the maximum amount of reversal that a system will experience. An AC circuit will experience 100% voltage reversal, while under-damped DC circuits will experience less than 100%. Reversal creates excess electric fields in the dielectric, causes excess heating of both the dielectric and the conductors, and can dramatically shorten the life expectancy of the capacitor. Reversal ratings will often affect the design considerations for the capacitor, from the choice of dielectric materials and voltage ratings to the types of internal connections used.","completion":"If a capacitor can handle the maximum amount of reversal, it means that the capacitor is designed to withstand the stresses induced by the electric fields and the heating caused by voltage reversals. In such a case, the capacitor will experience minimal wear and have a longer life expectancy. This is because the capacitor's design considerations, including the choice of dielectric materials, voltage ratings, and its internal connections, have been optimized to handle the maximum reversal conditions for that specific system (100% for AC circuits or less than 100% for under-damped DC circuits)."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Every year on this day, organizations all over the country celebrate young volunteers, educate young people about how they can help their country, and invite them to participate in service projects. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \\"National Youth Service Day honors young volunteers and is an invitation to others to join hands and do our part as Americans.\\" Founded in 1988, NYSD originally took place on a Tuesday. Now the event lasts from Friday until Sunday so that more people can participate in it. More than 200 organizations work together to create thousands of projects each year. Millions of young people across the United States take part in these service projects. Long before the event, people, community groups, schools, and nonprofit organizations think of ways to meet their communities' needs. Then, they plan projects for young volunteers. Projects include bringing food to hungry people, tutoring younger children and helping senior citizens. During the event, young people from the community do things like planting neighborhood gardens and cleaning up local parks. The organizations that contribute to NYSD believe that volunteering and community service are important activities for people of all ages, but especially for young people.

Among given answer choices A-E, the most common, immediate, but not long-lasting side effect of having a bath is D. Wet Skin. Let's go over each choice to better understand why this is the case. A. Use of Water: While taking a bath certainly does involve the use of water, referring to this as a \\"side effect\\" is ambiguous. It is not usually termed as a 'side effect' as it's essentially the mean; not an aftereffect or an unintended consequence of bathing. B. Drowning: While technically it is possible that someone could drown in a bath, it is not a common side effect. Drowning is a very serious and dangerous occurrence that results from being submerged under water without being able to breathe, and it's not generally associated as a common risk with bathing. C. Rash: In some cases, certain individuals may experience rashes from taking a bath, especially if they are allergic to certain ingredients in their soaps or bath products. However, this is not a common overall side effect of bathing. D. Wet Skin: By immersion in water during a bath, one's skin becomes wet. This is an immediate and direct side effect of taking a bath. However, it is temporary and not long-lasting as skin dries out after stepping out of the bath and drying off with a towel or simply air drying. E. Dry Skin: This could be considered a side effect of excessive bathing or using hot water and harsh soaps, as it can strip the skin of its natural oils leading to dry skin. However, not everyone who bathes ends up with dry skin, especially when using moisturizing products or moisturizing immediately after a bath. Thus, it's not as universally common as wet skin. In summary, while all the options given have conceivable links to bathing, the most commonplace and short-lived side effect of taking a bath is getting one's skin wet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Boulder, Colorado (CNN) -- Clear skies allowed for more evacuations and rescues in flood-devastated Colorado on Friday, but the forecast through Sunday called for more heavy rain. Even after the last of the storms, authorities can't say how long it will take to reach residents who will remain isolated by devastated roads. The confirmed death toll reached four when Boulder County officials recovered the body of a woman who had been swept away after getting out of her vehicle Thursday, Sheriff Joe Pelle said. Authorities already had recovered the body of a man who left the same car and tried to save the woman. One other death had been reported in Boulder County and one occurred in El Paso County. President Barack Obama declared an emergency for Boulder, Larimer and El Paso counties, FEMA announced Friday. The declaration allowed FEMA to bring in four rescue teams, the largest ever deployment in Colorado, officials said. More heavy rain is forecast through Sunday for the region, on top of the 15 inches some parts of the state have already received. \\"This isn't over,\\" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. On Friday, National Guard troops using \\"high-profile\\" trucks to wade through water were evacuating the entire Boulder County town of Lyons, which had been cut off since the flooding began Wednesday night. \\"It just really felt like God came down and saved us. It felt great,\\" Melinda Villa said of the National Guard's arrival at the Lyons apartment where she was stranded with her 1-month-old infant. She said, \\"I just felt like I was trapped. No phone, no water, barely any formula for my baby, barely any food for us.\\" Jonathan Linenberger described a Noah's Ark-style evacuation as he, his fiancee and four dogs and three cats greeted the National Guard truck. \\"We had to go (through) knee-deep water, at least. We had to wade our animals across into the truck to get them there,\\" said Linenberger. \\"That was the first thing you can grab, your loved ones -- and that's what we have.\\" The National Guard also was evacuating the entire population -- 285 people -- from the town of Jamestown by helicopter, CNN affiliate KCNC-TV reported. Four helicopters were being used for rescues in Boulder County Friday, Pelle said. The sheriff said helicopters also may have to be used indefinitely to deliver food and water to residents along damaged rural roads. \\"Please know we're working hard,\\" Pelle told residents who might see his televised news conference. \\"We're concerned about you. But you're going to have to be patient. Please know this is an unprecented event.\\" About 80 people in Boulder County have been reported missing or \\"unaccounted for\\" by relatives, Sheriff's Cmdr. Heidi Prentup said. The University of Colorado canceled Saturday's scheduled football game against Fresno State. In Larimer County to the north, Sheriff Justin Smith surveyed the heavily damaged Big Thompson Canyon by air Friday. Some people remain stranded in homes there, he said, adding, \\"How we're going to get them out -- it's going to take a damn long time.\\" However, he said the break in the rain Friday allowed school buses to begin evacuating students who had been stranded at a school. Smith described widespread damage to roads. He estimated 17 miles of Highway 34, a major artery, will need to be rebuilt. Lyons rescue The National Guard effort to get residents out of Lyons began shortly after daybreak. About 100 troops in 21 heavy vehicles able to ford high waters streamed into the city to begin moving residents out, Gov. John Hickenlooper said. Residents had been entirely cut off, without water or sewer service, in many cases without electricity, facing what Fire Chief J.J. Hoffman said in a Facebook posting was a \\"very large disaster.\\" It was unclear when the evacuation would be complete. \\"I encourage all of you -- stay strong!\\" Hoffman wrote on the fire department's Facebook page. \\"We will make it through this, we are here for you and doing the absolute best we can with the resources we have to get to each and every one of you!\\" As Lyons evacuees arrived at a shelter set up in a church in nearby Longmont, they told stories of houses ripped off their foundations as the St. Vrain Creek turned into a violent river, CNN affiliate KMGH reported. KMGH reporter Theresa Marchetta said evacuees also described homes dangling off cliffs. Some people in Lyons still were awaiting rescue, evacuees said, and some residents had chosen to stay. Marchetta said evacuees told her there had been a town meeting and residents were checking on each other to ensure no one was missing. Danger elsewhere State transportation officials issued an emergency alert to residents in some of the hardest-hit counties, warning them to stay off roads because many are unstable and could give way without notice. They also closed Interstate 25 from the Wyoming line south to Denver. Part of Interstate 70 also was shut down. In Fort Collins, some residents had been urged to leave their homes. And in Denver, police responded when a man was swept into a drainage pipe with his dog. Both were saved after traveling two blocks in the water, police said on Twitter. The rains sent virtually every waterway in Boulder County coursing out of its banks, and massive water flows washed away roads and bridges, flooded homes and stressed numerous other bridges. In the early hours Friday, flood sirens sounded in Boulder County as emergency officials feared that debris-caked canyons might give way and send another wall of water crashing through the city of Boulder and neighboring communities. \\"All residents are warned to go to higher ground immediately due to the potential for flash flooding along the creek,\\" Boulder's Office of Emergency Management said. Emergency management warned that \\"there are mudslides at the mouth of Boulder Canyon 400 feet long and four feet deep as the sides of the canyon give way due to the saturation from the days-long rain.\\" Authorities continued to warn of the danger of mudslides Friday night.

Heavy rain returned to the region Thursday evening, threatening an equally disastrous Friday. By the end of Thursday, thousands had been evacuated from their homes in places as far apart as Loveland, Erie and Aurora as rain-swollen creeks and rivers threatened their homes. Nearly every road heading into the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson counties was blocked by floodwaters or debris. Loveland and Longmont were essentially shorn in two by road closures near the Big Thompson and St. Vrain rivers that kept residents on one side unable to cross to the other. Sonia Chacon clears debris from around her family's home in north Boulder. Floodwaters damaged roads and homes, and left three people dead. (RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post) At least three Colorado towns — Lyons, Estes Park and Jamestown — were entirely isolated by water. Xcel Energy cut off power to most of Lyons. In Estes Park, a community of about 6,000 people, both telephone lines and cellphone towers were down. As darkness fell, the only communication into or out of the town was by ham radio. \\"God, it just needs to stop,\\" said Bob Stahl, who lives within a block of the St. Vrain River in Longmont. \\"I just hope it quits.\\" So fierce and sustained was the deluge that officials said they don't know how bad the damage is or how long it will take to fix. Roads crews couldn't reach flooded areas. More heavy rain was expected overnight and Friday morning — both prolonging the rivers' menace and delaying the recovery from their wrath. All together, the floods were expected to be some of the worst in state history. \\"It's going to take us a while to rebuild from this, no question,\\" Gov. John Hickenlooper said Thursday afternoon. \\"A storm of this size is going to cause severe consequences.\\" Even without more rain, flooding was expected to ripple for days. Flooding is predicted on Friday along the South Platte River east of Greeley, said U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Robert Kimbrough. On Saturday, minor flooding is expected along the same river near Sterling. \\"We can anticipate we will see rivers going above flood stages as that flood crest makes its way downstream,\\" Kimbrough said. Hickenlooper said he had summoned help from the National Guard. The White House announced Thursday night that President Barack Obama had declared an emergency in Boulder, El Paso and Larimer counties, so that money and resources can come to the state more quickly. Purely by the numbers, the storm's might was staggering. Dozens of communities from Fremont County to Larimer County reported flooding, a swath of rain roughly equivalent to the distance between Baltimore and New York. For Boulder, which saw some of the worst flooding, Kimbrough said there was only a 1-in-100 chance that a storm of this magnitude would happen in a year — meaning the storm is a proverbial 100-year flood.

(RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post) Boulder Creek's flow rate, measured at one point at 4,500 cubic feet per second, was more than twice as large as the previous peak flow recorded during the river gauge's quarter-century history. Typically the river runs at between 100 and 300 cfs. With at least 10 inches of rain having fallen across the city since the storm began, Boulder's 25 square miles were inundated with roughly 4.5 billion gallons of water. On the University of Colorado at Boulder campus, one quarter of all buildings had suffered some type of water damage, although much of it was minor, a school spokesman said.

(Doug Conarroe, North Forty News) Flash-flood warnings lit up Adams, Denver, Larimer, Boulder, Jefferson, Arapahoe, Douglas, El Paso, Lincoln, Cheyenne and Kit Carson counties on Thursday night. The National Weather Service warned that any given storm cell was capable of dropping multi-inch amounts in only a few hours. \\"(A) major flooding/flash-flooding event (is) underway at this time with biblical rainfall amounts reported in many areas,\\" the National Weather Service announced Thursday morning. State climatologist Nolan Doesken said the floods are not the worst Colorado has ever seen but they are unusual for being so widespread. A stubborn low-pressure system from the north and a persistent suction of moisture from the south have collided over the state, he said. The result is a perpetual loop of rain. Flood waters engulf the front of a pair of cars on a property along Weld County Road 2 in Northglenn, Colorado on September 12, 2013. (Seth McConnell, The Denver Post) Doesken said the storm is similar to one that occurred in September 1938, when flooding rampaged through Morrison, Eldorado Springs and parts of El Paso County — a storm The Denver Post at the time called \\"A moment's madness of the skies.\\" \\"This is not unprecedented,\\" Doesken said. \\"It is simply not common.\\" The floods' impact, though still unclear, was devastating. One man, who neighbors identified as Joey Howlett, 72, was reported killed after a building collapsed in Jamestown, in the mountains above Boulder. Later, the body of a man family identified as Wesley Quinlan was found in north Boulder in the 200 block of Linden Drive. Officials said that man had been with a woman in a car that became stranded in the area. The woman is still missing. In Colorado Springs, emergency crews checking flooding conditions early Thursday discovered the body of a man in Fountain Creek, near Nevada Avenue and Las Vegas Street. The man was identified Thursday afternoon as Danny Davis, 54. \\"The event is far from over,\\" Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said at a morning news conference. \\"We know we've lost lives. As the day goes on, we may find we've lost others.\\" Only quick evacuations and moments of heroics prevented other deaths. Officials in Erie, Longmont and Loveland moved rapidly to evacuate residents in flood-prone areas. Emergency crews in Aurora, Commerce City, Denver and Jefferson County scrambled to rescue drivers stranded in floodwaters. Firefighters in Broomfield pulled two people out of cars that splashed into floodwaters when the section of Dillon Road that they were driving on crumbled beneath them. A third motorist was able to free himself from his vehicle. \\"I have people banging on the doors,\\" one of the first police officers on scene shouted into his police radio. \\"There's one overturned. I'm hearing people banging. I can't get down there right now.\\" North Metro Fire & Rescue firefighters used a raft to rescue the two, who suffered only minor injuries. Throughout the day, residents in the flood's path looked on with disbelief as their neighborhoods turned suddenly threatening. Three Loveland police officers knocked on Julie Demaree's door at 3 p.m. Thursday to deliver a fairly short, blunt order: \\"You have 30 minutes, ... so get out.\\" Demaree and her boyfriend collected their things and their dog and headed toward a hotel near Interstate 25 and U.S. 34. As they left, they looked back on the sliver of the Big Thompson River that runs by Demaree's condo. \\"I liked to walk on the little walking trail there, but now it's completely flooded,\\" she said. \\"By the time we left, the water there had gone up 3 feet.\\" Conditions worsened throughout the day in Longmont, and, by late afternoon, the evacuation center at Silver Creek High School had registered 150 people. \\"We are having a hard time getting supplies,\\" said Steve Aubrey, a Boulder County Sheriff's deputy. \\"We are checking with the National Guard to see if we can get cots for everyone tonight.\\" Many tried to stay upbeat. On Twitter, a man posted a picture of himself holding a fish he said he caught. The fish was swimming around the basketball hoop in his driveway. For Grant Hetherington and Jyssica Lasco, the flood washed away their plans to be married Friday at the Stone Mountain Lodge in Lyons. They had spent a year-and-a-half planning the event. A half-day's work on Thursday quickly switched the wedding to a venue in Loveland. \\"I cried a little, but I'm still marrying my best friend and the love of my life,\\" said Lasco, 24, \\"and we're sending our thoughts out to those affected by the flooding.\\" As rain continued to fall into the night, officials said that was about all that could be done. Earlier in the day, Hickenlooper was asked whether the state had the resources to deal with the flooding. The governor insisted it did. It was just that, on Thursday, the rains reigned. \\"It's not that we haven't had the equipment or the manpower,\\" Hickenlooper said. \\"It's that the conditions haven't permitted it.\\" Staff writers Suzanne Brown, Joey Bunch, Tom McGhee, Jeremy P.

Bratton was publicly sworn in on Thursday by Mayor Bill de Blasio as commissioner of the New York Police Department, the second time in two decades that he is leading the nationâs largest police force. William J. Bratton was sworn in on Thursday as theÂ 42nd commissioner of the New York Police Department by Mayor Bill de Blasio. A day after officially taking over the department early Wednesday at a private midnight ceremony, Commissioner Bratton stood before a packed hall at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan and promised a new era of policing in the city. He began his speech by saying, âWho says you canât come home again.â During his address, Mr. Bratton promised âa collaboration unlike any that we have ever seen in this cityâ between the police and the people they serve. He said he would seek to understand the âdisconnectâ that had prevented the department from being celebrated for its accomplishments in delivering a safe city in recent years and instead was met with distrust in many communities. âThatâs why I came back,â he said. A law enforcement leader with international renown, Mr. Bratton, 66, returns to a department he last ran in the 1990s, when the task before him was to reduce crime. On Wednesday, he succeeded Raymond W. Kelly, whom he also replaced in 1994. The city has grown safer since then, recording fewer than 340 murders in 2013 compared with about 1,500 in 1994. But the practices of the Police Department, especially in minority neighborhoods where crime stubbornly remains, became the focal point of Mr. de Blasioâs successful campaign. Promises to reform the department were instrumental to his victory. Mr. Bratton, who becomes the cityâs 42nd police commissioner, must now try to make good on the pre-election rhetoric of the man who picked him to better relations between the Police Department and minorities, especially to change the stop-and-frisk tactics that have sown distrust in many quarters. Mr. Kelly, who has staunchly defended the practices as being a legitimate anticrime tactic, did not attend Thursdayâs ceremony. But Mr. Bratton did praise his predecessorâs record. Mr. Bratton will most likely draw on his experience in Los Angeles, where he led a police force, which had become synonymous with corruption and brutality, out from under a federal consent decree in the 2000s. He reached out there to the departmentâs critics early on, and won over most of them by the time he stepped down in 2009, despite a doubling in the number of stop-and-frisk encounters during his tenure. Mr. Bratton has applied a similar playbook so far in New York, meeting with minority leaders and the departmentâs ardent critics almost immediately after his selection was announced last month. Addressing the rank-and-file officers on Thursday, Mr. Bratton sought to reassure them that he would be a strong defender of their interests, as well. How much the officers on the street support him will probably be a significant factor in maintaining a level of safety that New Yorkers have come to expect. After leaving the New York Police Department in 1996, Mr. Bratton took a number of security positions and founded his own consulting company; he was widely sought as an adviser for police departments across the country and the world. In recent years, he served as chairman of Kroll, the private security and investigations company, and on the boards of Motorola Corporation and ShotSpotter, a gunshot-detection technology company. In those positions, he has emphasized the importance of collaboration in business and law enforcement success. Mr. Bratton closed by addressing 10 members of the most recent Police Department academy class, who graduated last week and were seated at the front of the hall, which was filled with policing leaders from around the country. âEveryday you get the opportunity to do good,â he said. âIt doesnât get any better than that.â Write a title for it.","completion":"William J.

Write some highlights for the following article: An underground website that was dealing cocaine and other illegal drugs has been shut down, federal authorities said today. U.S. law enforcement shut down Silk Road, an anonymous Internet marketplace for illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and criminal activities such as murder for hire, and arrested its alleged owner. Silk Road owner, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' was arrested in San Francisco on Tuesday, according to court filings. Criminal network: Ross William Ulbricht, 29, has been arrested in San Francisco over the alleged drug-dealing activities of his website Silk Road. Ulbricht, who holds an advanced degree in chemical engineering, appeared in federal court on Wednesday and a bail hearing was set for Friday. His lawyer Brandon LeBlanc, a public defender, declined to comment. A Google+ account for Ulbricht had this post on April 9 last year: 'Anybody know someone that works for UPS, FedEX, or DHL?' Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ulbricht with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, the filing said. 'Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today,' FBI agent Christopher Tarbell said in the criminal complaint. The site was used by 'several thousand drug dealers' to sell 'hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs,' he said. The site, which has operated since early 2011, also offered tutorials on hacking ATM machines, contact lists for black market connections and counterfeiters, and guns and hit men for sale, according to the charges. More than 900,000 registered users of the site bought and sold drugs using the digital currency Bitcoin. Time's up: The FBI has shut down Silk Road, an anonymous Internet marketplace for illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and criminal activities such as murder for hire. In recent media reports about the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the Silk Road website has emerged as part of a darker side to the use of digital currencies. Through the site, according to the charges, users could buy drugs and have them shipped to an address. Investigators, posing as regular users on Silk Road, made more than 100 purchases of drugs, which were shipped to the New York area. According to the complaint, Ulbricht, who shortened his alias from Dread Pirate Roberts to DPR when posting on Silk Road's forums, operated the site from San Francisco. It's a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation. Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. Famous fans include the Winklevoss twins - famous rivals of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg - who own around 1 per cent of Bitcoins - currently worth around 11million. It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers. There are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold. The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. They were introduced by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay. At times, he used computers at Internet cafes to access the servers running the website, which employed several technological tools to mask the location of its servers and the identities of its administrators and users. The complaint described other aspects of Ulbricht's online presence: In a Google+ profile, he described himself as a fan of libertarian economic philosophy and posted videos from the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an Auburn, Alabama-based economics institute. Reached by phone in Austin, Texas, Ubricht's parents said they had not known what their son was doing in San Francisco. 'He is a really stellar, good person and very idealistic,' said Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Lacava. 'I know he never meant to hurt anyone.' Ulbricht's father Kirk confirmed his son had received a master's in material sciences from Pennsylvania State University. His thesis was titled: Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. 'He did amazing research on crystals and exotic materials they hoped would have some use for humans, Ulbricht said. 'But it was very theoretical stuff.' The complaint against Ulbricht describes a darker side. During one correspondence with a Silk Road user, Ulbricht tried to call out a hit on another user with whom he had a dispute. That user, known online as FriendlyChemist, was threatening to expose the identities of thousands of Silk Road users unless Ulbricht sent him money. 'I wouldn't mind if he was executed,' Ulbricht wrote, offering personal details about his foe, including the fact that he was a married father of three, and the names of the city and province where he lived. In a later post, Ulbricht wrote: 'He is threatening to expose the identities of thousands of my clients.' 'This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me. Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct.' During the raid, authorities seized 3.6 million worth of bitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to complete transactions on Silk Road. Facing charges: Ulbricht, 29, is due in court on Friday. He has an advanced chemisty degree and 'very idealistic', according to his parents. The charges against Ulbricht said his website generated sales of more than 9.5 million bitcoin, roughly equivalent to 1.2 billion. Authorities seized the currency by taking control of the digital 'wallets' Silk Road used to store bitcoin. In a corresponding civil asset forfeiture action, prosecutors claimed Silk Road and Ulbricht were liable to the government for the value of all transactions involving drug tracking and computer hacking, as well as for money laundering penalties, and a final amount would be determined at trial. The raid on Wednesday was not the first time the U.S. government has made arrests related to Silk Road. Earlier this year, authorities in South Carolina arrested Eric Daniel Hughes, known on Silk Road as 'Casey Jones', and charged him in state court with drug possession. The Drug Enforcement Agency seized units of bitcoin, which Hughes allegedly used to purchase drugs from the online market. Bitcoin, which has been around since 2008, first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking the digital currency to Silk Road. Highlights:","completion":"- Federal authorities shut down Silk Road, an underground website dealing in illegal drugs and other criminal activities. - Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged owner of Silk Road, was arrested in San Francisco and is charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. - Silk Road operated since early 2011, and more than 900,000 registered users traded drugs using Bitcoin as digital currency. - Investigators posed as users and made over 100 purchases of drugs, which were then shipped to the New York area. - Authorities seized 3.6 million worth of Bitcoin during the raid and Ulbricht's website reportedly generated sales of more than 9.5 million Bitcoin (around 1.2 billion). - Prosecutors claim Silk Road and Ulbricht are liable to the government for the value of all transactions involving drug tracking, computer hacking, and money laundering penalties, with a final amount to be determined at trial."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872? from the following article ? There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of...

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: You may have heard the term \\"the American Dream\\". In 1848, James W. Marshall found gold in California and people began having golden dreams. That 19th century \\"American Dream\\" motivated the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \\"Golden State\\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next. People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets. But most, instead, worked as railroad labourers. They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream. After years of hard work, he grew from a poor young man from Austria into a movie superstar and then governor. Many people hope his story can save the American Dream and give California a brighter future. Question: Why did most of the early immigrants work as railroad laborers?

Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor).

It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). - State or provincial parks are parks or other protected areas managed at the sub-national level within those nations which use \\"state\\" or \\"province\\" as a political subdivision.

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Nevada City (originally, Ustumah, a Nisenan Maidu village; later, Nevada, Deer Creek Dry Diggins, and Caldwell's Upper Store) is the county seat of Nevada County, California, United States, located northeast of Sacramento and 28 miles north of Auburn.

The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. - Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of gravity acting on the particles. For example, sand and silt can be carried in suspension in river water and on reaching the sea be deposited by sedimentation and if buried this may eventually become sandstone and siltstone, (sedimentary rocks). - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - A tax incentive is an aspect of a country's tax code designed to incentivize, or encourage a particular economic activity. - Mining is extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth usually from an orebody, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposits. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological and/or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term \\"protected area\\" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas. - The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

A deadly virus released in 1996 wipes out almost all of humanity, forcing survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus. In 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected to be trained and sent back in time to find the original virus in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport. Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors, and he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but disappears moments later, and wakes up back in 2035. He is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield during World War I, is shot in the leg, and then is suddenly transported to 1996. Answer:","completion":"James Cole"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the confrontation's end, however, the conflict isn't finished, says Harry Reid. \\"We can’t have an American people that violate the law and just walk away from it,\\" he said on Nevada's KRNV, via the Washington Times. \\"So it’s not over.\\" Many protesters were still at Bundy's ranch as of yesterday, the Times notes.","completion":"Title: Nevada Standoff Concludes Peacefully, But Questions of States' Rights Remain On Saturday, a potentially grim confrontation between a rancher's supporters and federal officials ended without any violence in Nevada. The standoff was primarily centered around the question of states' rights. Former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack had devised a strategy in case the situation escalated: he planned to place women at the forefront of the confrontation so that, in the event the federal officers resorted to shooting, it would be televised internationally, showcasing this misconduct. However, this contingency plan was never needed, as the standoff concluded peacefully. The rancher in question, Cliven Bundy, whose son and supporters sought to intimidate federal officials using their weapons, managed to retrieve their seized cattle without incident. Bundy's son told Reuters that the objective was to open the gates and walk through peacefully to reclaim their cattle (which were eventually returned). These actions were taken as an assertion of states' rights in response to perceived injustices committed by the federal government. While the physical conflict was resolved, the underlying issues are far from settled. In an interview with Nevada's KRNV, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid emphasized the importance of upholding the law, stating that the American people cannot \\"walk away from it.\\" According to Reid, the conflict is not over and the stand on states' rights will undoubtedly provoke further reflection. Many protesters remained at Bundy's ranch as of yesterday, with the Washington Times noting the ongoing tension in the area. In conclusion, although the standoff at the Nevada ranch ended peacefully, the conflict involving states' rights and federal authority continues. The Bundy family and their supporters managed to make a statement, but questions regarding the limits of federal power and the rights of citizens continue to demand attention."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Molecules on the surface are pulled inward by cohesive forces, reducing the surface area. Molecules inside the liquid experience zero net force, since they have neighbors on all sides. Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Making Connections: Surface Tension Forces between atoms and molecules underlie the macroscopic effect called surface tension. These attractive forces pull the molecules closer together and tend to minimize the surface area. This is another example of a submicroscopic explanation for a macroscopic phenomenon. The model of a liquid surface acting like a stretched elastic sheet can effectively explain surface tension effects. For example, some insects can walk on water (as opposed to floating in it) as we would walk on a trampoline—they dent the surface as shown in Figure 11.28(a). Figure 11.28(b) shows another example, where a needle rests on a water surface. The iron needle cannot, and does not, float, because its density is greater than that of water. Rather, its weight is supported by forces in the stretched surface that try to make the surface smaller or flatter. If the needle were placed point down on the surface, its weight acting on a smaller area would break the surface, and it would sink. Q: Surface tension forces between moleculse cause the surface of liquid to contract to what? Choices: - typically surface area - Weak Surface area - strongest surface area - smallest surface area A: Answer:","completion":"smallest surface area"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Step 2: This equation can be solved by isolating l, i.e., getting l on one side of the equation by itself. Step 3: To do this, we should eliminate the \\"-29\\" on the left side of the equation. We can achieve this by adding 29 to both sides of the equation. Doing the same operation on both sides of an equation keeps the equation balanced and doesn't change its solution. So we have: l - 29 + 29 = -35 + 29 This simplifies to: l = -35 + 29 Step 4: Finally, simplify the right side expression: l = -6 So, the solution to the equation \\"l - 29 = -35\\" is l = -6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the band member who left the Smashing Pumpkins in 2009?, using the article: The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Summarize this article: Politics being showbusiness for ugly people, Joan Collins has no interest in getting involved in it. As we learn in her new book, a manifesto entitled The World According to Joan, at 18 she was voted “Most Beautiful Girl in England” (page 46), while at the age of 21 she was signed up to a film in which she had to play “the most beautiful girl in New York” (page 49). Dear Joanie tells me that she did once get involved with UKIP, “but I wasn’t sure it was the kind of thing I wanted to do. I’m not Glenda Jackson.” No, heaven forbid. So where does La Collins fall on the political spectrum? “I’d say I was Conservative party, 1940s.” She laughs huskily; it’s ever so naughty. “And I was a very big supporter of Thatcher.” What does she think of David Cameron? “I like David, but I think he’s hog-tied by what’s-his-name.” Nick Clegg? “Yes. I’m not a big fan.” And what does she think of Ed Miliband. “Not a lot,” she says simply. Even though La Collins insists that a life in Westminster holds no thrall for her – she is, after all, 78, and goodness knows what the electorate would make of her second and third homes in Los Angeles and St Tropez – she doesn’t hesitate when I ask her what she would do if, in a parallel universe, Joan Collins were Prime Minister. “First, education. I think it is shocking that 15- and 16-year-olds leave school unable to add up and with the reading ability of a four-year-old. When I was at school, I was terrible at algebra and arithmetic, but I was always the best at English and literature. And acting, of course.” She does a self-mocking “Of course I was” shrug of her shoulders, which are currently minus Dynasty-style pads. “I always did the best essays. I edited the fourth-form school magazine because, while I always wanted to be an actress, at the back of my mind I also wanted to be a dress designer and a writer, and funnily enough I have actually ended up doing all three.” But enough about her talents. She settles herself in to a huge sofa in the Dorchester, the cushions almost swallowing her little frame, before launching back in to the Joan Collins plan to fix Britain. “Second, immigration. Because the reason we don’t have any housing is that we have 400,000 extra people coming in here every year and doing jobs that our young people could do.” “And that’s just the ones we know about,” adds her publicist. “Yes!” says Joan, throwing her dainty little jewel-encrusted and manicured hands in to the air. “Exactly! In Birmingham last Christmas, I said to my driver, ‘Why are there no decorations?’ I had just come back from New York where every street is festooned with decorations. And he said, ‘Well, we have a lot of people here whom it offends on religious grounds.’ But I’m not saying any more than that. I don’t want petrol bombs being thrown through my window.” She is weary of being seen as an old reactionary, but then she hasn’t much time for being politically correct. And it would be easy to dismiss her views as irrelevant, that of an out-of-touch septuagenarian millionairess who splits her time between two continents. And yet, the more I listen to her, the more I think she makes some quite salient points, that she simply says what she sees. Even the assertions in her book about her great beauty cease to seem arrogant – more of a statement of fact. She is a diamond-encrusted battleaxe. What else does she want to talk about? The riots, of course. “These kids are so ignorant and stupid. I don’t think they have much of a moral compass now because they spend their life doing – what are those games they do? The ones where they kill and they shoot? And they watch a lot of violent stuff on television.” She sighs. “And, of course, porn is readily available.” Joan, the star of such films as The Bitch and The Stud can’t “stand watching porn”, even tried getting it taken off her Sky system, “but, unfortunately, it’s part of the package”. It would never have been like that in her day. “I hear that it is far more disgusting than it was 20 or 30 years ago, and kids of 11 can watch it on their phones at school. So they are desensitised. I don’t think they have much judgment. They think that, when they kick a pensioner to death – which seems to happen on a regular basis in this country – they’re not actually kicking a real person. Violence has become normalised in this country, and I think it’s quite tragic.” La Collins is sipping on a Bloody Mary and eating a club sandwich – or at least parts of it, removing layers of bread as she goes. Last night was her book launch, attended by the likes of Frederick Forsyth, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Christopher Biggins, Nicky Haslam “and lots of my friends who are not ‘above-the-title’ names”. At this she lets out another throaty laugh. The book puts down reality television stars, declining standards in dress (“It’s no one’s fault to be born ugly, but, honestly, must it be worn as a symbol of pride?”) and a lack of chivalry in men (“Gone are the days when a gentleman lightly took your hand in his and brushed his lips across it, or tipped his hat to acknowledge you as he chivalrously stepped aside to let you pass”). Men are turning gay because women are unfeminine. Women over a size 10 should not wear slip dresses, and nobody should show bare legs in winter. Ankle-strap shoes are “seriously unattractive”, and she advises against wearing jeans. “Rarely glamorous” is her damning indictment of them. Joan, whose fifth husband Percy is 32 years younger than her, sits in front of me in a cream beret and a zebra-print dress. She is dripping in gold jewellery. Her publicist tells me: “I rarely wear any make-up, but, at the end of a day with Joan, I am caked in it.” La Collins looks incredible and you can tell this is actually because she has had no work done and stayed natural (she thinks sex is better than Botox). How, I ask, does she look so glamorous the whole time? “You think I’m glamorous today? This is all just thrown together. What I find extraordinary is that all these girls today go out in the coldest weather, wearing the shortest skirts with crop tops, no stockings and no coats.” She shivers at the thought. “But I guess they can’t take the coats in because they will just get stolen.” I wonder what she makes of modern-day celebrities. She once said that the only person she could think of with true star quality was Angelina Jolie, so I decide to throw some names at her. What does she think of Gwyneth Paltrow? “Is she the one who called her grandmother a rude word on air?” she asks, dismissively. “I thought that was pretty shocking.” Kiera Knightley? “Well, she’s thin,” is all Joan will say. Carey Mulligan? “I don’t want to comment on Carey Mulligan,” she remarks sadly, before proceeding to do just that. “I can’t believe she’s playing Eliza Doolittle in a new movie.” I move on and show her a picture of Kate Winslet taken a few days earlier at the Venice Film Festival. She lets out a huge sigh. “Oh, that’s a dreadful dress. The worst dress. And ghastly shoes and an awful hairstyle. I’m sorry.” She shakes her head. I move away from actresses. Adele? “She’s a very good singer, very, very talented, but she has a terrible hairpiece.” Joan, a self-confessed wig wearer, knows a lot about hairpieces. Kate Moss is “OK, but she’s not Linda Evangelista in my mind”. I clutch desperately at straws. There must be one modern-day female she admires. Victoria Beckham? “Oh I love Victoria Beckham. You’ve finally found someone I like.” And that’s the other reason Joan Collins could never be a politician: she tells it like it is. ‘The World According to Joan’ by Joan Collins is available exclusively from Sainsbury’s at a special introductory price of £5 (RRP: £12.99) ||||| Joan Collins has apparently never heard the the old adage, \\"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.\\" The 78-year-old British actress is acting just as catty as the \\"Dynasty\\" character, Alexis Carrington, she's best known for playing. With her new book, \\"The World According To Joan,\\" Collins calls it as she sees it, and doesn't hold anything back. The book puts down reality TV stars, modern fashion, and makes the assertion that men are \\"turning gay because women are unfeminine\\", reports The Telegraph who asked her for thoughts on some of today's A-list stars. Upon seeing a photo of actress Kate Winslet at the Venice Film Festival, the paper reports Collins let out a sigh and said, \\"Oh, that's a dreadful dress. The worst dress. And ghastly shoes and an awful hair style.\\" Collins takes fashion very seriously. After all this is the same woman who after feeling faint was rushed from this year's Vanity Fair Oscar party in an ambulance -- all because the dress she wore was too tight. Collins also said she didn't want to comment on actress Carey Mulligan, but then told The Telegraph, \\"I can't believe she's playing Eliza Doolittle in a new movie.\\" All Collins would say about Kiera Knightley is that she's thin, and that while singer Adele is talented, she wears terrible hair pieces. Wondering Collin's thought's on Kate Moss? She says Moss is \\"OK, but she's not Linda Evangelista.\\" Collins has never been shy with her opinions about celebrities, and in 2010 told the UK's Hello! magazine that she didn't think there were many good looking actresses around today, with the exception of Angelina Jolie. \\"Jennifer Aniston is cute, but I wouldn't call her beautiful. I think that's why Cheryl Cole is so popular, because she is just so pretty and public are starved of gorgeous people,\\" she declared. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Joan Collins, British actress and renowned beauty, shares her opinions on politics, societal issues, and celebrities in her new book, \\"The World According to Joan.\\" She aligns herself with the Conservative party and expressed support for Margaret Thatcher, while showing less enthusiasm for David Cameron and Nick Clegg. On societal matters, she expressed concern over education, criticizing the inability of 15- and 16-year-olds to perform basic academic tasks. She links this to immigration saying that the influx of people into the UK is taking away opportunities from young individuals. Joan criticizes modern society for being oversaturated with violent video games and pornography, saying that it has desensitized children and normalized violence. Moreover, Joan doesn't shy away from expressing her critiques on modern clothing styles and today's celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Kiera Knightley, Carey Mulligan, and Kate Winslet. However, she did express admiration for Victoria Beckham, singing praises for her. The outspokenness of the 78-year-old actress is consistent with her \\"Dynasty\\" character, Alexis Carrington. Her book critiques modern fashion, reality TV stars, and makes bold statements, demonstrating the similarity between her and her onscreen persona."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

I can use this background: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. Now, I have a new situation: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Answer this question please: Which lever would have smaller mechanical advantage, lever A or lever B?","completion":"Based on the background information provided, lever A is a hypothetical lever with the ideal mechanical advantage, while lever B is a real-world lever. The ideal mechanical advantage represents the maximum possible increase in force that a lever can achieve under perfect conditions, without any loss due to friction or other inefficiencies. In the real world, however, these ideal conditions do not exist, as every machine encounters some friction or inefficiencies. Because ideal mechanical advantage assumes zero friction, it represents the best case scenario or the maximum potential mechanical advantage a lever can achieve. In contrast, the actual mechanical advantage of a lever takes into account the friction and other inefficiencies that affect the performance of the machine. Therefore, these losses will cause the actual mechanical advantage to be lower than the ideal mechanical advantage. Since lever A is designed with the ideal mechanical advantage in mind, it represents the potential maximum mechanical advantage that can be achieved under perfect conditions. On the other hand, lever B is a real-world lever that experiences losses due to friction and other inefficiencies, which will cause its actual mechanical advantage to be somewhat lower than the ideal mechanical advantage. In conclusion, given that lever A represents the ideal mechanical advantage while lever B is a real-world lever with an actual mechanical advantage, lever B would have a smaller mechanical advantage compared to lever A. This is because the ideal mechanical advantage of lever A assumes no losses due to friction, thus representing the maximum possible force increase, whereas lever B's actual mechanical advantage does experience losses resulting in lower force increase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

It also showed the biggest format changes since the introduction of the Gundersen method at the 1985 World Championships in Seefeld , Austria . In addition of the 10 km mass start event , there were changes in the Gundersen - based individual events . The 7.5 km sprint event was changed to a 10 km individual large hill event while the 15 km individual event was changed to a 10 km individual normal hill event with both being approved in September 2008 . These changes also affected the Nordic combined program for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver though the mass start was excluded . The United States , which had two medals in Nordic combined prior to this championships ( Johnny Spillane : gold in 7.5 km sprint at Val di Fiemme in 2003 and Bill Demong : silver in 15 km individual at Sapporo in 2007 ) , won a total of four medals with three golds and a bronze .

Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - The 2008/09 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup was the 26th world cup season, a combination of ski jumping and cross-country skiing organized by FIS.

Established on September 30, 2003, about four months after the 2010 games were awarded to Vancouver, British Columbia, it performed these roles with \\"the mandate to support and promote the development of sport in Canada.\\" - The Gundersen method is a method in the Nordic combined developed by Gunder Gundersen, a Nordic combined athlete from Norway, that was first used in the 1980s. This technique turned the cross country skiing part of the Nordic combined from a point-based system where all athletes ski in an interval start manner and whoever earned the most points with the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined won the event to a pursuit race for the cross country skiing part where whoever crossed the finish line first in the cross country skiing part of the Nordic combined event won the competition. This parallels the modern pentathlon in which the start times of the final event (a cross-country run) are also staggered so that the first to cross the finish line is the winner of the entire event. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. - The 1972 Winter Olympics, officially known as the (French: Les \\"XIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), were a winter multi-sport event which was held from February 3 to February 13, 1972, in Sapporo, Hokkaid, Japan. It was the first Winter Olympics to be held outside Europe and North America, and only the third game (summer or winter) held outside those regions over all, after Melbourne (1956 Summer Olympics) and Tokyo (1964 Summer Olympics). - The 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"XXIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\") and commonly known as Vancouver 2010, informally the 21st Winter Olympics, were a major international multi-sport event held from February 12 to 28, 2010, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with some events held in the surrounding suburbs of Richmond, West Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands, and in the nearby resort town of Whistler. Approximately 2,600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines. Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games were organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC), headed by John Furlong.

Phase I utilizes 50 Vestas V-90 Mk.5 wind turbine generators, each with a rated capacity of 3 MW. BP will operate phase I of the project. Can we infer the following? the project needs 5 wind turbine generators (a). Yes. (b). It's impossible to say. (c). No. The answer is:","completion":"(c). No. The Sherbino Mesa Wind Farm, located in Pecos County, Texas, is a large-scale renewable energy project with a potential capacity of 750 MW. The initial operating capacity of the project is 150 MW, powered by 50 Vestas V-90 Mk.5 wind turbine generators, each with a rated capacity of 3 MW, which are distributed across the project area to generate clean, renewable electricity for the region. To answer your question, we need to clarify what information we are aiming to infer. If we are investigating whether the project needs 5 wind turbine generators for the entire project or for Phase I, the answer is no. As mentioned earlier, the first 150 MW of the project, called Phase I, is in operation and utilizes 50 Vestas V-90 Mk.5 wind turbine generators, each with a rated capacity of 3 MW. This means the total number of required wind turbine generators for Phase I is already 50, not 5. Furthermore, your question states that the potential capacity of the Sherbino Mesa Wind Farm is 750 MW. If we assume that the wind turbine generators being used continue to be the Vestas V-90 Mk.5 models with their 3 MW rated capacity, achieving a total project capacity of 750 MW would actually require 250 wind turbine generators: 750 MW (potential capacity) ÷ 3 MW (generator capacity) = 250 generators. So, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the project needs 5 wind turbine generators in any context. The correct answer is (c). No."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Turnover of integrin-based focal adhesions (FAs) with the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for coordinated cell movement. In collectively migrating human keratinocytes, FAs assemble near the leading edge, grow and mature as a result of contractile forces and disassemble underneath the advancing cell body. We report that clustering of microtubule-associated CLASP1 and CLASP2 proteins around FAs temporally correlates with FA turnover. CLASPs and LL5β (also known as PHLDB2), which recruits CLASPs to FAs, facilitate FA disassembly. CLASPs are further required for FA-associated ECM degradation, and matrix metalloprotease inhibition slows FA disassembly similarly to CLASP or PHLDB2 (LL5β) depletion. Finally, CLASP-mediated microtubule tethering at FAs establishes an FA-directed transport pathway for delivery, docking and localized fusion of exocytic vesicles near FAs. We propose that CLASPs couple microtubule organization, vesicle transport and cell interactions with the ECM, establishing a local secretion pathway that facilitates FA turnover by severing cell-matrix connections.","completion":"Title: CLASPs' Role in Focal Adhesions Turnover: Coupling Microtubule Organization, Vesicle Transport, and ECM Interactions for Efficient Cell Movement"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Victims threaten to boycott Woolf inquiry into child abuse Pressure on Lady Woolf to step down as the new head of the government inquiry into child abuse has intensified after a lawyer representing almost 50 victims said a number would not participate because of their concern about how it was going to be run. The claims, by Alison Millar, a partner at Leigh Day solicitors, came as the leading organisation representing abuse survivors said many feared that it would be “a whitewash” and questioned Woolf’s credentials to lead the inquiry. Woolf has been under scrutiny after it emerged that she had attended a number of social gatherings with Lord and Lady Brittan. Lord Brittan’s role as home secretary in the 1980s is considered by abuse survivors to be crucial to the inquiry. They want to know what happened to a dossier about alleged Westminster paedophiles that went missing from his department. “As Leon Brittan is potentially such an important figure in this investigation, to appoint somebody who has demonstrably had more than a passing connection to the Brittans renders her unsuitable for the post,” said Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood. “We’ve heard from many survivors who are extremely distressed. They are saying it’s going to be a whitewash, that it doesn’t want to speak to the victims and that’s just a paper exercise. They are worried it’s not going to get to the truth of what happened.” Victims are dismayed that Woolf, who is to stand down as Lord Mayor of London next month, will be taking up another demanding job, separate from her role heading up the inquiry. “Some of my clients question her capability in terms of her diary commitments to do this very complex and lengthy inquiry,” Millar said. “She’s due to take on a prestigious appointment with the University of Law, which will involve promoting it to international students. We want to know: does she have a lot of international trips booked, is she going to be able to come to the meetings? You cannot do this remotely.” Saunders also questioned Woolf’s expertise. “She’s a corporate lawyer; she has no experience in investigating serious criminal cases,” he said. Woolf is under pressure to release the draft of her letter sent to the Home Office outlining the social contacts she had with the Brittans. It is unclear whether the letter was then subject to revisions. Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs select committee, has asked Woolf to clarify a number of points regarding her appointment by next week. One law firm has already drawn up plans to seek a judicial review of Woolf’s appointment. Millar suggested that that remained a possibility for her clients too. She said many had been upset by Woolf’s recent appearance before Vaz’s committee. “One of the things that angered our clients was when Fiona Woolf started talking about the victim community,” Millar said. “There is no victim community; they are survivors of child abuse. They do not live in a communal state. They are a disparate range of people whose interests are not homogenous. Quite often they are isolated from other people, including each other, and they’re not all talking and saying ‘we want this we want that’. However, all the clients I’ve spoken with are unanimous that they don’t want Fiona Woolf to chair this inquiry because the perception of her is someone too close to the establishment. “A number of my more vocal clients have said they’re not going to participate in the inquiry as it’s currently set up,” Millar said. “Whether they feel as strongly when the inquiry gets going I don’t know. But you’ve got a pretty sceptical group of people. If you set an inquiry up from day one that looks like it’s not going to listen to them, they are going to turn their back on it.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"People who were hurt as children are not happy with Lady Woolf leading an important investigation about child abuse. They are worried that she won't do a good job and find the truth, because she has connections with some people involved in the case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Christopher (Billy Drago), a Victorian era American journalist, is traveling through Japan looking for Komomo (ItÃ´), a lost girlfriend whom he had promised to rescue from prostitution and bring to America. Landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). He claims no knowledge of Komomo, but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room. Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hung herself after her love never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past â her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously â underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums â she hung herself in torment and tired of waiting for her love. Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth. The girl starts again, in the second telling, her family is no longer happy nor loving; her father was an alcoholic, her mother an abortionist. She was taken in by a Buddhist priest, who, presumably, molested her and inspired an obsession with hell. Her father never died of lung disease â she beat him to death for raping her. Again she tells of being sold into prostitution, but gives a new version of the dark fate of Christopher's beloved Komomo. Despite the kindness of Komomo, who befriended her, the disfigured girl stole the jade ring and planted Komomo's hairpin to frame her â and after Komomo was tortured, killed her. She explains to Christopher that she intended to save Komomo from hell: as Komomo would be doomed...

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue.

Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers.

Justin has never had any animals in his house unlike Derrick because","completion":"Justin's family was allergic to animal fur. Derrick, however, had grown up surrounded by a variety of animals, including dogs, cats, and even a few more exotic pets like iguanas and parakeets. Justin often found himself envious of the bond that Derrick had with his pets, and he longed for that kind of companionship. Step 1: Establishing the characters' desires and backgrounds To continue the story, we need to establish what each character's desires and backgrounds are. Justin wants to experience having a pet but cannot due to his family's allergies, while Derrick is already very experienced with having pets. One day, when Justin was hanging out at Derrick's house, he noticed a small aquarium in the corner of the room. Inside the aquarium were a few colorful fish swimming around. As he watched the fish, an idea began to form in his mind - perhaps there was a type of pet that his family could have without triggering their allergies! Step 2: Introducing a potential solution to Justin's problem Now that we've established the characters' backgrounds and desires, the story can progress to offer a potential solution to Justin's longing for a pet. In this case, the solution could be a hypoallergenic pet, like fish. With excitement, Justin approached Derrick to learn more about the fish and how to properly take care of them. Derrick enthusiastically told Justin all about the different species living in the aquarium, as well as the care and maintenance required to keep them happy and healthy. Step 3: Building the bond between characters through shared interests By having Derrick share his knowledge about aquarium care with Justin, we create a bond between the two characters and show the beginning of a mentor/apprentice relationship with Derrick guiding Justin in the realm of pet ownership. Over the following weeks, Justin researched more about fish and aquariums, eventually convincing his parents to let him set up a small fish tank in the living room. With Derrick's help, Justin bought all the necessary equipment and fish, slowly starting his journey as a fish owner. Step 4: Demonstrating growth and progress for Justin as a pet owner Show Justin's dedication to learning about fish and actually setting up an aquarium in his home, which demonstrates growth and progress in achieving his goal of having a pet. As Justin's collection of fish grew, so did his bond with Derrick. The two friends spent countless hours discussing their shared passion for animals, even visiting aquariums and local pet stores during their free time. Justin's family soon found that they, too, enjoyed the calming presence of the fish and appreciated their son's growing sense of responsibility. Step 5: Showing the positive effects on both characters and their families Displaying how Justin's passion for fish positively impacts not only himself but also Derrick and their respective families will wrap up this part of the story nicely. Over time, Justin and Derrick's passion for animals continued to grow. They both knew that, despite their differences, their shared love of animals brought them closer together and enriched their lives in a way they could never have predicted. Step 6: Closing the story with a reflection on the characters' growth and friendship Conclude the story by acknowledging the growth of both characters through their shared passion for animals, and how their friendship was strengthened by their experiences together. In summary, the story highlights the journey of Justin in overcoming obstacles to experience the joy of pet ownership and building a stronger bond with Derrick through their shared love of animals. The story also showcases the positive effects that their passion for animals brought to their lives and the lives of their families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown. - A priest or priestess (feminine) (from Greek \\"presbýteros\\" through Latin \\"presbyter\\", \\"elder\\", or from Old High German \\"priast\\", \\"prest\\", from Vulgar Latin \\"provost\\" \\"one put over others\\", from Latin \\"praepositus\\" \\"person placed in charge\\"), is a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively. - Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. - A sobriquet is a nickname, sometimes assumed, but often given by another. Distinct from a pseudonym that is assumed as a disguise, it usually is a familiar name, familiar enough such that it may be used in place of a real name without the need of explanation. This salient characteristic is of sufficient familiarity that the sobriquet may become more familiar than the original name. - John William Waterhouse (April 6, 1849 February 10, 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to his sobriquet \\"the modern Pre-Raphaelite\\". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists, his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend. - The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government. - The Blue Carpet is a piece of Public Art in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, designed by Thomas Heatherwick. Although classified as a piece of public art, it is closer to an urban design feature. The piece occupies a public open space in front of the Laing Art Gallery, close to the main shopping and nightclub areas. - The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century. - Charles William Mitchell ( 1854 -- 1903 ) was an English Pre-Raphaelite painter from Newcastle .

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - Charles Kingsley (12 June 1819 23 January 1875) was a broad church priest of the Church of England, a university professor, social reformer, historian and novelist.

It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. - Newcastle upon Tyne, commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and forms the core of Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Broad church is a term referring to latitudinarian churchmanship in the Church of England in particular and Anglicanism in general.

Wells' novel, \\"The Time Machine.\\" The text speaks of a secret passage that connects the present world with the world of the Morlocks. Intrigued by the idea, Alexander begins his research to decipher the passage's location, only to find that he's reached a dead end. But fate has other plans for Alexander when he encounters a mysterious and enigmatic mentor named Orpheus, who claims he has been searching for the Morlocks for centuries and possesses the knowledge of ancient arts and time travel. Brought together by their shared curiosity, Alexander and Orpheus form an unlikely alliance as they decipher clues and unravel mysteries to locate the passage. On their quest, they face numerous challenges and dangers, including the deceptive charm of the Sirens, who attempt to hinder their progress, and a rogue time traveler named Atticus, who seeks to harness the power of the Morlocks for his own sinister reasons. With time running out, Alexander and Orpheus are led to a forgotten underground city hidden beneath the largest metropolis in the world. There, they discover the Morlocks, a highly advanced but troubled society who, despite their frightening appearance, possess the secrets to both the universe's creation and its inevitable destruction. However, upon finding the Morlocks, Alexander and Orpheus uncover a shocking truth: the Morlocks are not the monsters once depicted in literature, but rather the gatekeepers to an ancient secret. This secret reveals that a cosmic force called the Shadow Divide threatens to tear apart time and space itself, and only Alexander, taught by the wisdom and guidance of Orpheus, has the power to unite the past, present, and future into one cohesive timeline and save humanity from ultimate annihilation. In the end, as Alexander embraces his newfound destiny and Ascends to his full potential, he must call upon the wisdom of the Morlocks and allies from different times and realms to confront the adversarial forces conspiring against him and prevent the looming apocalypse. Fractured alliances will be mended, betrayals will be revealed, and the ultimate battle for time and existence will be waged, with the fate of countless worlds hanging in the balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wikipedia is not a reliable source for academic writing or research.

Choose from: (i). no. (ii). yes.","completion":"(i). No. It is not advisable to cite Wikipedia as a source in a research paper or academic writing. The reasons for this are as follows: 1. Lack of reliability: The main reason for not using Wikipedia as a source in academic writing is its lack of reliability. Unlike peer-reviewed articles and books, the content on Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, regardless of their expertise or credibility. As a result, information on the platform can be inaccurate, biased, or incomplete. 2. Frequent changes: Wikipedia's content is constantly being updated and modified. As an open-content platform, anyone can edit or add new information. Consequently, there is always a risk that the information you cite may be changed or removed entirely at a later time. 3. Informal nature: Wikipedia is meant to be a \\"quick reference\\" source and is not intended for in-depth research. The writing style and tone of Wikipedia articles are often informal and may not meet the rigorous standards expected in academic writing. 4. Lack of proper citation and sources: While Wikipedia articles generally contain citations and references to other sources, the quality of these references varies. In some cases, sources may be unverifiable, biased, or not meet academic standards. By citing Wikipedia, you may inadvertently cite less reputable sources. 5. Plagiarism concerns: Since Wikipedia is an open-content platform, the text within Wikipedia articles is often borrowed or paraphrased from other sources. If you were to directly quote information from Wikipedia without verifying the original source, you risk unintentional plagiarism. To ensure the credibility and reliability of your research paper, it is best to use primary and secondary sources that have undergone a peer-review process, such as articles from scholarly journals, books, or other reputable sources. While Wikipedia can be a valuable starting point for getting a general understanding of a topic, it should not be cited as a definitive source in academic writing. Instead, use the references listed in Wikipedia articles to track down primary and secondary sources that can be cited with confidence."},{"prompt":"Question: Article: How could we tell time if there were no watches or clocks anywhere in the world?
