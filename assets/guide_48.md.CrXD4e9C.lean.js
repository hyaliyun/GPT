Question: What is the last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida...

Please answer a question about the following article about Unicode: Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and the now-obsolete UCS-2. UTF-8 uses one byte for any ASCII character, all of which have the same code values in both UTF-8 and ASCII encoding, and up to four bytes for other characters. UCS-2 uses a 16-bit code unit (two 8-bit bytes) for each character but cannot encode every character in the current Unicode standard. UTF-16 extends UCS-2, using one 16-bit unit for the characters that were representable in UCS-2 and two 16-bit units (4 × 8 bits) to handle each of the additional characters. How are two 16-bit units used?","completion":"In Unicode, two 16-bit units are used to encode a character in a process known as \\"UTF-16 surrogate pairs\\". This allows representation of characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of Unicode, which is the range of characters that can be represented using a single 16-bit unit. To better understand how two 16-bit units are used, let's first look at some background information: 1. Unicode assigns each character a unique code point, ranging from 0x0000 to 0x10FFFF. 2. The BMP comprises the first 65,536 (0x0000 to 0xFFFF) code points, which can be represented by a single 16-bit unit. 3. There are 1,048,576 (0x10000 to 0x10FFFF) code points outside the BMP, referred to as Supplementary Unicode characters or \\"Astral characters.\\" UTF-16 uses the following process to represent characters with two 16-bit units: 1. For characters within the BMP (0x0000 to 0xFFFF), UTF-16 uses a single 16-bit unit that directly corresponds to the Unicode code point. 2. For characters outside the BMP (0x10000 to 0x10FFFF), UTF-16 utilizes a pair of 16-bit units called \\"surrogate pairs\\": a. The first 16-bit unit, known as the \\"high surrogate\\" or \\"leading surrogate\\", falls within the range 0xD800 to 0xDBFF. b. The second 16-bit unit, called the \\"low surrogate\\" or \\"trailing surrogate\\", falls within the range 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF. To encode a character outside the BMP using two 16-bit units, UTF-16 follows these steps: 1. Subtract 0x10000 from the Unicode code point of the character to obtain a 20-bit value. 2. Split the 20-bit value into two parts: the upper 10 bits and the lower 10 bits. 3. Add 0xD800 to the upper 10 bits to determine the high surrogate. 4. Add 0xDC00 to the lower 10 bits to determine the low surrogate. The result is a surrogate pair comprised of two 16-bit units. The high surrogate appears first, followed by the low surrogate. When decoding a UTF-16 encoded character, the reverse process is followed: retrieve the high and low surrogates, subtract the appropriate base values, and reassemble them into a complete Unicode code point. In summary, UTF-16 encoding uses two 16-bit units, or surrogate pairs, to represent characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane. This allows encoding of the full range of Unicode characters by splitting the 20-bit value into two 10-bit parts and adding specific values to form the high and low surrogates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Advani spent his initial years in Kuwait before moving to Bangalore, India. He received his education at the Frank Anthony Public School, Bangalore and completed his bachelor's degree in Commerce from Sri Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain College. He received training in snooker from former national Snooker champion Arvind Savur. Pankaj Advani, on international competitive debut in the discipline, won the IBSF World Snooker Championship (i.e. the World Amateur Snooker Championship) on 25 October 2003 in Jiangmen, China. He was 18 years old, and became the youngest Indian to win the title, his first world title. A decade later, as a 28-year-old, at the IBSF World 6-Red World Snooker Championship in Sharm-El-Sheik, Egypt, he won one of the amateur world titles (on debut in the short format). As a new player on the tour, Advani would need to win four matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events. He did this in just his fourth attempt, when qualifying for the International Championship. He defeated Craig Steadman 6-1, six-time world champion Steve Davis 6-5 (after being 1-4 down), Alan McManus 6-3 and Michael Holt 6-4 to reach the venue stage for the first time. He made four century breaks during qualification, the most of any player. Advani was to play a wildcard match once at the tournament in Chengdu, China, to reach the last 32, however he decided to withdraw from the tournament to take part in the World Billiards Championship, which he went on to win. He also reached the semi-finals of the minor ranking European Tour Event 1, beating four-time world champion John Higgins 4-1 along the way. Advani lost to Mark Selby 2-4. Advani played in eight of the ten of these Players Tour Championship events and finished 40th on the Order of Merit. At the 2013 Welsh Open, he became the first Indian player to reach the quarter-final stage of a ranking event with a 4-1 win over Graeme Dott in the last 16, but lost 2-5 to Judd Trump. Advani's season ended when he was beaten 8-10 by Joe Swail in the first round of World Championship Qualifying. He was ranked world number 74 after his first year on the main snooker tour. Has he ever competed in the US?","completion":"The article doesn't mention if Pankaj Advani has competed in the US.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Wash your sheets regularly and avoid putting items under your bed.; +Avoid sleeping in bed. Wash your sheets regularly and avoid putting items under your bed.;","completion":"The more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning would be: +Avoid eating in bed. Wash your sheets regularly and avoid putting items under your bed. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Avoid eating in bed: Eating in bed might attract spiders because it can lead to crumbs or leftovers which can, in turn, attract insects that spiders prey upon. Therefore, by not eating in bed, you can reduce the chances of attracting spiders. 2. Wash sheets regularly: By washing your sheets regularly, you eliminate possible insect eggs, bodies of tiny insects, or food particles that could attract spiders. 3. Avoid placing items under the bed: Items under the bed can create perfect hiding and breeding spots for spiders. By avoiding placing items under your bed, you can limit the possible spaces that spiders could inhabit. Whereas, \\"avoid sleeping in bed\\" is an impractical method of keeping spiders away. It does not address the source of the spider issue and simply vacating your own bed doesn't deter spiders or reduce their populations. This suggestion seems based more on fear or dislike of spiders than any sound scientific reasoning.

Hamilton argued that the natural faculties of blacks were as good as those of free whites, and he warned that the British would arm the slaves if the patriots did not. In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks. In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president. Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York. In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina. He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument. Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries. In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France. Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees).

On the other hand, the statement \\"A woman sits at a table.\\" only provides baseline information without any additional specifics. This statement does not give any information about the woman's ethnicity, the color of the table, or what the woman is wearing, but it still accurately conveys the essential action taking place: a woman sitting at a table. Thus, while the two statements differ in the level of detail they provide, the core message remains the same.

In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would case A have higher or lower air pressure above it than case B? Hint: Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. The answer is:","completion":"Case A would have lower air pressure above it than case B. This is because, in case A (airplane wing), the air flows more quickly and has lower air pressure above the wing, which creates lift, allowing the airplane to rise against gravity. In case B (race car spoiler), the air flows more slowly and has higher air pressure above the spoiler, which pushes the car downward, providing better traction on the track."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Report cyberbullying. Stay safe.","completion":"Title: Staying One Step Ahead: How to Effectively Deal with Cyberbullying Introduction In today's hyper-connected world, interactions with people across the globe have become the norm. Our lives are rapidly being shaped by technology, and we are more dependent on it than ever before. While these advancements have made our lives more convenient, they have also opened doors for new forms of harassment, most notably, cyberbullying. Cyberbullying can manifest in various forms, from harassing messages to public shaming. It is essential to know how to use technology to your advantage, counteract such situations, and stay safe. In this article, we will discuss some effective strategies for dealing with cyberbullying. 1. Use Technology to Your Advantage Oftentimes, the tools we utilize in our everyday lives can be our first line of defense against cyberbullying. By educating ourselves on the different tools and settings available on social media platforms, messaging apps, and online games, we can take control and minimize the risk of encountering a cyberbully. Some techniques include: - Adjust privacy settings to limit who can view your profile or send you messages. This narrowing of your online network can help prevent unsolicited interactions and comments. - Utilize content filters to block certain words or phrases from appearing in your comments and messages. This can deter cyberbullies from sending harmful language. - Use tools such as Google Alerts to notify you of whenever your name or personal information is mentioned online. This way, you can monitor and quickly address any potential cases of cyberbullying. 2. Don't Feed the Trolls One of the most common pieces of advice given to those dealing with cyberbullies is to ignore them, as responding can often fuel their behaviors. Cyberbullies seek attention and want to elicit a reaction from their targets. By not engaging with them, you deplete their power. Stay calm and resist the urge to \\"fight back\\" or defend yourself. If the attack persists, consider blocking the individual or stepping away from your device for a while, allowing time for your emotions to settle. 3. Record Evidence Keeping a record of cyberbullying incidents serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it helps you keep track of events and patterns in case you need to report the incident. Secondly, it provides concrete evidence of the harassment for authorities, schools, or internet service providers. Take screenshots of troubling messages, posts, or comments and store them in a secure location. Remember to include the date, time, and any other relevant details about the incidents. 4. Report Cyberbullying In many cases, it is crucial to report cyberbullying incidents to the appropriate parties. This can include school administrators, platform moderators, or even local authorities if necessary. By reporting these events, you help ensure that the bully is held responsible for their actions and that steps are taken to stop further harassment. However, it's also important to evaluate the situation carefully, and only escalate if you or someone else's safety is at stake. 5. Stay Safe Your primary objective should always be to prioritize your safety and well-being. This means staying aware of your boundaries and knowing when to take a break from online activities. Furthermore, it is key to develop a support network that can provide assistance should you encounter a cyberbully. This could include friends, family, or even dedicated organizations such as helplines or online groups that focus on dealing with cyberbullies. Remember, you don't have to face this challenge alone. Conclusion Dealing with cyberbullying can be emotionally and mentally draining. However, by arming yourself with knowledge, utilizing the tools available to you, and knowing your limits, you can effectively combat these harmful behaviors and safeguard your well-being. Always remember to stay vigilant, do not engage with the aggressor, record evidence, report incidents when necessary, and prioritize your safety. Together, we can create a safer and more respectful online environment for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Entertainment Software Association reckons that nearly one third of all Americans will give a computer game as a Christmas gift in 2004.","completion":"The topic discussed in the given text is about the popularity of video games as Christmas gifts in America. To delve into the topic, it revolves around the growing culture of video games in the United States and their relevance in gift-giving scenarios, specifically around Christmas time. The information primarily derives from a predictive statistic from the Entertainment Software Association. The Entertainment Software Association is the main association representing computer and video game publishers in the United States. Looking at the specifics, the text provides a forecast for the year 2004, seeming to be an influential year for the industry, given that nearly a third of all Americans were projected to give a computer game as a Christmas gift. This increase in giving digital gifts illustrates the evolving perception and acceptance of video games as viable and appreciated gifts. Previously, traditional gifts such as toys, books or clothes have dominated the Christmas gift-giving culture. The shift towards digital gifts, particularly computer games, could be attributed to the rise of information technology and digital media over the years. Moreover, this also reflects the influence of technology on social behaviors and traditions. The fact that computer games have become a popular choice for gift-giving indicates the changing dynamics of gift-giving itself. It reveals how the traditional act of gifting, once involving physical commodities, has been transformed into an exchange of digital goods, reflecting the embracing of newer forms of entertainment in everyday life. In summary, the topic revolves around the popularization of computer games as a preferred choice of Christmas gifts amongst Americans in the year 2004.

The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey. Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers. The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations. He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957.

Movie title: Skyrunners Context: Teenage brothers 18-year-old Nick and 14-year-old Tyler come across a UFO that crashed near their town. Soon after evading the government, mainly agent Armstrong, as well as keeping the UFO in seclusion, Tyler goes through dramatic physical changes and gains superhuman powers due to his dramatic trip into space via the UFO, including enhanced strength and telepathy, and he almost as tall as Nick. The situation becomes even more difficult to cover up considering that Tyler is being constantly blown off by Nick, due to Nick's efforts at chasing Julie Gunn, as well as Nick having to make a science project to graduate high school and reptile-like aliens that have begun to appear and pursue Tyler. After having literally no one left to turn to, Tyler decides to tell agent Armstrong about the UFO. After agent Armstrong explains to Tyler about the effects that his trip into space had on his body, he shoots the ship with a laser gun, thereby critically damaging it, before he reveals himself to Tyler as a reptile-like alien in disguise and captures him. Nick, feeling guilty for constantly doubting and ignoring Tyler, goes to the UFO hideout to try to apologize. Upon finding that Tyler is missing and the UFO damaged, he begins an attempt to repair the UFO. After trying all night, he is successful and the UFO takes him to the hidden underground fortress in which the aliens are residing and realizes that it is actually an impact crater from the aliens' crash-landing on Earth. Nick locates Tyler and frees him from his holding cell. The brothers uncover that the aliens are planning to take over Earth by polluting the atmosphere. Tyler then uses an alien explosive from the UFO to destroy the aliens and their pollution equipment and escape in the UFO. However, they do not succeed in destroying all of them and are chased by a surviving alien in a more powerful version of their UFO. After destroying the alien fighter and its pilot in a fast-paced dogfight, the UFO crashes at Nick's high school graduation. Nick then uses fixing...

Movie title: Good Morning, Vietnam Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1965, Airman Second Class Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) arrives in Saigon from Crete to work as a DJ for Armed Forces Radio Service. Cronauer is greeted by Private First Class Edward Montesquieu Garlick (Forest Whitaker). Cronauer's irreverence contrasts sharply with many staff members and soon rouses the ire of two of his superiors, Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming, while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor (Noble Willingham) and the other DJs quickly grow to like the new man and his brand of comedy. Cronauer's show consists of unpredictable humor segments mixed with news updates (vetted by the station censors) and rock and roll records that are frowned upon by his superiors. Cronauer meets Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), a Vietnamese girl, and follows her to an English class. Bribing the teacher to let him take over the job, Cronauer starts instructing the students in the use of American slang. Once class is dismissed, he tries to talk to Trinh but is stopped by her brother Tuan. Instead, Cronauer befriends Tuan and takes him to Jimmy Wah's, the local GI bar, to have drinks with Garlick and the station staff. Two other soldiers, angered at Tuan's presence, initiate a confrontation that Cronauer escalates into a brawl. Dickerson reprimands Cronauer for this incident, but his broadcasts continue as before. While relaxing in Jimmy Wah's one afternoon, he is pulled outside by Tuan, who says that Trinh likes him and wants to see him, moments before the building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving Cronauer badly shaken. The cause of the explosion is determined to be a bomb; the news is censored, but... A:","completion":"Based on the film synopsis you provided for \\"Good Morning, Vietnam,\\" there were two soldiers killed as a result of the building explosion. This occurs during a scene where the main character, Adrian Cronauer, is relaxing at a local GI bar named Jimmy Wah's. He gets taken outside by Tuan, Trinh's brother who he had befriended, moments before the building explodes. This incident leaves Cronauer greatly affected both physically and emotionally. As for your initial question about whether investing in this film proposal is a good idea, a number of factors need to be considered. Since \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\" is an already-established film (released in 1987), if the proposal is to remount or remake this movie, consider the success of the original film first. The original was critically acclaimed and well received by audiences, with a highly memorable performance by Robin Williams. It served as a unique combination of dramatic wartime storytelling with humor and satire. Therefore, if the idea is to remake this film, comparisons will undoubtedly be made to its predecessor. It's essential to ensure that the new adaptation will possess a fresh perspective or a modern take that resonates with today's audience, while still preserving the elements which made the initial release successful. This includes a strong script, engaging performances, nuanced direction, and perhaps a thoughtful examination of war and its effects through relevant, contemporary lenses. Moreover, consider the current landscape of movies and whether a war-time film balances between drama and humor like \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\" does will attract modern audiences. Will the themes appeal or resonate with them? Is there potential for this kind of story in the global market? Additionally, it's also worth considering the financial aspect such as the proposed budget, potential returns, marketing strategy, and distribution plan. And don't forget the production team and cast. One of the main attractions of the original film was the performances of the actors, most notably Robin Williams. It'd be important to attach actors who can draw audience as well as deliver strong performances. Also, consider whether the director and production crew are capable of delivering the vision for the movie. Overall, this is a decision that requires careful thought and research. If you can consider these angles and confidently see the potential success, then it may be worth investing in. Then again, every investment carries a risk and in the unpredictable world of filmmaking, there can never be guarantees of success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The green algal endosymbiont also exhibits a stunted vestigial nucleus. In fact, it appears that chlorarachniophytes are the products of an evolutionarily recent secondary endosymbiotic event. The plastids of chlorarachniophytes are surrounded by four membranes: The first two correspond to the inner and outer membranes of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium, the third corresponds to the green alga, and the fourth corresponds to the vacuole that surrounded the green alga when it was engulfed by the chlorarachniophyte ancestor. In other lineages that involved secondary endosymbiosis, only three membranes can be identified around plastids. This is currently rectified as a sequential loss of a membrane during the course of evolution. The process of secondary endosymbiosis is not unique to chlorarachniophytes. In fact, secondary endosymbiosis of green algae also led to euglenid protists, whereas secondary endosymbiosis of red algae led to the evolution of dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and stramenopiles.

Aston Martin's Vanquish Zagato Is the Most Beautiful Car of 2016 Aston Martin has just unveiled what gets my vote for the most beautiful car of the year: the Vanquish Zagato Concept. The British auto brand and the Italian coach builder have designed five cars together, dating back to the DB4 GT Zagato in 1960. This is their first since the V12 Vantage Zagato, in 2013. This is the fifth car that the British auto brand and the Italian design house have made together. The concept was developed at Aston headquarters in Gaydon, England. The new bodywork is made entirely of carbon fiber, and fresh proportions give it a stance that’s more aggressively styled than its production counterpart. The concept was developed at Aston headquarters in Gaydon, England; interior work was conceived in Milan. In fact, the car combines the best elements of just about every Aston Martin model. The Vanquish Zagato Concept has new lights and round tail reflectors that make it look like a classic Zagato, but this year’s version also uses the supermodern “bladed” LED lights it debuted on the track-only Aston Martin Vulcan. Its winglike mirrors are inspired by the One-77 Aston; its sculpted rear and retractable spoiler evoke the best assets of the DB11. It comes with a retractable rear spoiler and two slight “bubbles” in the roofline. That subtle double indentation dipping into the rear-window glass—the so-called double bubble—is a throwback to 1950 Zagato models, which required extra space above the seats to accommodate racing helmets without ruining the entire aerodynamic profile of the car. Winglike mirrors and sculpted sides are inspired by the One-77. Like the limited-edition Vantage GTS I drove last week, it has a quad-exhaust format and carbon-fiber sills that circle the lower part of the car. The windshield and side mirrors blur into one glass frame that wraps around the front of the car; the sides run from wheel arches to doors in the design first introduced by the CC100. It’s a lot to take in. The windshield wraps around the car from side to side like the cockpit on a private jet. Inside, Aston has added herringbone-patterned carbon fiber with leather and “Z” quilt stitching on the headrest, seats, center console, and door sections. The V12 engine is boosted to 600ps (592hp), with enhanced engine systems and chassis dynamics that make driving the thing almost as exciting as just looking at it. But I’m guessing you were already sold on this car without needing to know that. Aston has added herringbone-patterned carbon fiber with leather and “Z” quilt stitching on the headrest, seats, center console, and door sections. Unfortunately, Aston hasn’t confirmed prospective pricing on the car, or even whether it’ll actually make any of them. (The 2013 Aston Martin V12 Zagato cost roughly 450,000.) So start saying your prayers now. The world needs more beautiful machines, and this one looks downright heavenly. Aston did not respond to questions regarding when—if ever—it will produce the Vanquish Zagato Concept. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Aston Martin, a British car company, has just revealed a new car called the Vanquish Zagato Concept, which some people think is the most beautiful car of the year 2016. This car is special because it's the fifth time Aston Martin has collaborated with an Italian design company called Zagato. They've been making cars together since way back in 1960! This new Vanquish Zagato Concept was built in England, at Aston Martin's headquarters. The body of the car is made completely out of something called carbon fiber, which is a very strong and light material. The car has features from many other Aston Martin models, like a special type of light called a \\"bladed\\" LED light which was first used on the Aston Martin Vulcan, a race car. The car even has a little \\"double bubble\\" dip in the rear window. This bubble is a cool design trick from the 1950s that was used to create extra space for the racing helmets without changing the car's shape too much. Inside the car, there's a special zig-zag pattern stitched into the seats, doors, and other parts. The car is also very powerful and has a big engine that can produce 592 horsepower! However, we don't know if Aston Martin will actually make this car for people to buy, or how much it would cost. The previous car they made with Zagato in 2013 cost about 450,000!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: \\"Which is not a specific person: Timur, Sikander Lodi, or Vedic?\\" Context: \\"The history of the area that now constitutes Himachal Pradesh dates back to the time when the Indus valley civilisation flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE.

During the Vedic period, several small republics known as \\"Janapada\\" existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajput principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 10th century. Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles. Several hill states acknowledged Mughal suzerainty and paid regular tribute to the Mughals.\\" Answer:","completion":"In the context provided, Vedic is not a specific person, while Timur and Sikander Lodi are historical figures. Timur, also known as Tamerlane, was a Turkic-Mongol conqueror and the founder of the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia. He ruled from 1370 to 1405, and his conquests spread across West, South, and Central Asia, as well as parts of Eastern Europe. Timur was known for his military prowess, and his invasions significantly impacted the regions he conquered, including the area that now constitutes Himachal Pradesh. Sikander Lodi, born as Nizam Khan, was the second ruler of the Lodi Dynasty, ruling from 1489 to 1517. His given name was Sikander, which means \\"Alexander\\" and alludes to Alexander the Great. He was known for his administrative and military skills, as well as his passion for poetry and literature. Sikander Lodi expanded the Delhi Sultanate's territory and conquered several hill states in the area now known as Himachal Pradesh during his reign. The term \\"Vedic\\" refers to the Vedic period in the Indian subcontinent, which lasted from approximately 1500 to 500 BCE. This period was marked by the composition of the sacred Hindu texts called the Vedas, which formed the basis of Hinduism's religious, cultural, and philosophical development.

(CNN) -- In spite of heightened security due to a terror threat on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks, a South Carolina man was apparently able to sneak a stun gun into a professional football game and fired it into the crowd, police said Tuesday. Leroy T. McKelvey, 59, allegedly used the gun on three men in an upperdeck scuffle at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, during a Sunday match-up between the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys, according to New Jersey Police Sgt. Julian Castellanos. The three men suffered minor injuries, he said. McKelvey was charged with three counts of aggravated assault, possession of a stun gun and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes. He was taken to Bergen County Jail and later released on 22,500 bail. McKelvey could not immediately be reached for comment. When asked about the security breach, National Football League spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league is \\"always refining and improving our security procedures.\\" \\"These procedures have been successful in keeping items that can cause serious injuries out of our stadiums,\\" he said in a statement. \\"We will continue to be vigilant in protecting the safety of our fans.\\" Mark Lamping, the chief executive of MetLife Stadium, said the stun gun involved in the incident was the size of a small cell phone. \\"Procedures for pat downs established by the NFL and used at every game were in effect at all entry gates,\\" he said in a statement.

Movie title: Firefox Movie plot: MIG-31 Firefox A joint Anglo-American plot is devised to steal a highly advanced Soviet fighter aircraft (MiG-31, NATO code name \\"Firefox\\") which is capable of Mach 6, is invisible to radar, and carries weapons controlled by thought. Former United States Air Force Major Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood), a Vietnam veteran and former POW, infiltrates the Soviet Union, aided by his ability to speak Russian (due to his having had a Russian mother) and a network of Jewish dissidents and sympathizers, three of whom are key scientists working on the fighter itself. His goal is to steal the Firefox and fly it back to friendly territory for analysis. However, the KGB has got wind of the operation and is already hot on Gant's tail. It is only through the sympathizers that Gant remains one step ahead of the KGB and reaches the air base at Bilyarsk, where the Firefox prototype is under heavy guard. The dissident scientists working on the Firefox help Gant infiltrate the base. Dr. Pyotr Baranovich (Nigel Hawthorne), one of the scientists, informs Gant that there is a second prototype in the hangar that must be destroyed. The diversion will allow Gant to enter the hangar and escape with the first Firefox. Gant knocks out Lt. Colonel Yuri Voskov (Kai Wulff), a Soviet pilot assigned to take the first prototype on its maiden flight during a visit from the Soviet First Secretary. The scientists attempt the destruction of the second prototype to give Gant time to suit up and start the first fighter, but the second prototype is not destroyed, and the scientists are killed by the guards. Fortunately for Gant, he escapes the hangar and lifts off just as the First Secretary arrives. Evading the Soviets' attempts to stop him, Gant barely reaches the Arctic ice pack and lands for refueling, making a rendezvous with a US submarine whose crew refuels and rearms the aircraft. However, Gant's last-minute refusal to kill Voskov has consequences; the Soviet pilot flies the second prototype, with orders to wait for him at the North Cape area.... Answer:","completion":"The prototype that is under heavy guard in the movie \\"Firefox\\" is the highly advanced Soviet fighter aircraft called the MiG-31, NATO code name \\"Firefox.\\" This aircraft is a groundbreaking aviation marvel as it can reach speeds of up to Mach 6, remain invisible to radar, and features weapons systems controlled by the pilot's thoughts. The primary mission of the film's protagonist, former United States Air Force Major Mitchell Gant, is to infiltrate the Soviet Union and steal the Firefox aircraft from the heavily guarded air base at Bilyarsk. This task is especially challenging due to the KGB's awareness of the operation, requiring Gant to rely on a network of Jewish dissidents and sympathizers to remain one step ahead. Assisted by key dissident scientists working on the Firefox project, Gant makes his way into the Bilyarsk airbase, where he is informed by Dr. Pyotr Baranovich about the existence of a second prototype. The plan is for the second prototype to be destroyed as a diversion, enabling Gant to enter the hangar, steal the first prototype, and make his escape. Despite the subsequent failure to destroy the second prototype and the tragic deaths of the assisting scientists, Gant manages to successfully evade Soviet forces, steal the first Firefox prototype, and escape the airbase. He then endures a dangerous flight towards friendly territory, ultimately landing on the Arctic ice pack to refuel and rearm from a rendezvoused US submarine. In conclusion, the prototype under heavy guard in the movie \\"Firefox\\" is the innovative Soviet MiG-31 fighter aircraft. This dangerous mission to steal the aircraft and bring it back for analysis by the United States and its allies forms the basis of the film's thrilling plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Answer the following question: Background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. Paragraph: Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island burned less fossil fuels? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, Sand Island burned less fossil fuels in comparison to Grey Island.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story. You are also given three additional sentence options, a, b, and c, that may or may not belong to the story. Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story and their positions in the sentence order of the story; note that the selected choices may fit into the story at any point. Your answer must be in the form of '2a, 5b', where '2a' means the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story. The answer must also be in the order of the selected choices, i.e., '2a, 5b' is allowed, and '5b, 2a' is not allowed. If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense. Q: Title: The other workers kept guessing the wrong items. After 4 mistakes the system wouldn't let Kate complete the hit. She decided to quit working on chat hits. Choices: a.

A:","completion":"Part #1: You're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story. Usage: In this scenario, the title is \\"The other workers kept guessing the wrong items.\\" and the three sentences given are: \\"After 4 mistakes the system wouldn't let Kate complete the hit.\\", \\"She decided to quit working on chat hits.\\". This is satisfying this particular part of the task as it gives a title and three separate sentences which comprise parts of a five-sentence story. Part #2: You are also given three additional sentence options, a, b, and c, that may or may not belong to the story. Usage: The three options given are \\"I can't wait to watch another game with my friend again.\\", \\"Kate was forced to return the hit.\\", \\"Kate was working on chats hits on Mturk.\\" Here, each option may potentially fit into the existing story or maybe completely unrelated. Part #3: Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story and their respective positions in the sentence order. Usage: After evaluating the sentence options, you might decide that options 'b' and 'c' seem to fit best with the given title and sentences because they reference \\"Kate\\", \\"hit\\", and \\"chat hits\\", recurring themes throughout the snippets. Part #4: Your answer must be in the form of '2a, 5b', where '2a' means the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story. Usage: You decide that 'b' would best fit as the second sentence (\\"Kate was forced to return the hit.\\") and 'c' as the 4th sentence (\\"Kate was working on chats hits on Mturk.\\") to provide context for Kate's actions. Thus, your answer would be '2b, 4c', following the provided format. Part #5: The answer must also be in the order of the selected choices; the sentence's chronological order should reflect in the answer. Usage: You could not answer '4c, 2b', even if 'c' and 'b' are the options you picked. Here, the format '2b, 4c' satisfies the requirement as it places the events in the correct sequence. Part #6: If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense. Usage: Suppose option 'a' also has some relation to the story, but it doesn't fit logically into the context as well as 'b' and 'c'. In that case, you'd go with 'b' and 'c' - they make more sense within the given context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I refuse to use a white stick and hate asking for help, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I am not like them. I must be a terrible danger on the roads. Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something. \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost. This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off. No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound. Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus. Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did. But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by. I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one. Then I gave up. I decided to walk on to the next stop.

We are trying to find the value of \\"k\\" in this problem. Here is the equation: 865 = -14*k + 585 First, we want to move the 585 from the right side of the equation to the left side. We can do that by subtracting 585 from both sides. It will look like this: 865 - 585 = -14*k Now, let's do the math: 865 - 585 = 280. So now we have: 280 = -14*k Next, we want to get the \\"k\\" all by itself. To do that, we need to take the -14 and move it to the other side of the equation. We can do that by dividing both sides by -14. Like this: 280 / -14 = k Now, let's divide: 280 / -14 = -20. So, the value of \\"k\\" is -20.

Premise: EPA has concluded that it was not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis because the rule only affects motor vehicle manufacturers, a group that is not comprised of a substantial number of small businesses. Hypothesis: Motor vehicle manufacturers are not a group that has a lot of small businesses. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Pick from: *yes *it is not possible to tell *no And the answer is:","completion":"*yes The hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise. If we dissect the premise, it starts off by stating that the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has concluded it was not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis. This raises the question of why such an analysis would be unnecessary. The answer is given in the succeeding portion of the premise, stating it is because the rule only affects motor vehicle manufacturers, and that this group is not comprised of a substantial number of small businesses. This, in essence, summaries the hypothesis, which states: \\"Motor vehicle manufacturers are not a group that has a lot of small businesses\\". Therefore, the hypothesis is supported and verified by the premise. Moreover, the types of businesses that the rule is affecting – motor vehicle manufacturers – are not typically small businesses due to the high costs associated with the production and manufacturing of vehicles. Large financial resources are needed for such activities as research, development, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and servicing of vehicles. These high costs and complexities create a barrier to entry for small businesses into the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. The premise infers that since there isn't a substantial number of small businesses, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not necessary. A regulatory flexibility analysis is generally required to assess the impact of any proposed or final regulation on small businesses. However, with the motor vehicle manufacturers not being comprised of a substantial number of small businesses, the impact would be minimal or non-existent, resulting in the EPA's decision to forego the analysis. In conclusion, the premise directly links and supports the hypothesis. It clearly states that the group (motor vehicle manufacturers) is not composed of many small businesses, precisely as the hypothesis asserts, establishing a clear verification and thus indicating that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

Her 90-minute talk will also cover her involvement in refloating the wreck of the cruise liner Costa Concordia. Transocean Winner ran aground in a storm while under tow off Lewis. Ms Tervoort and her team used two tug boats to pull the 17,000 tonnes drilling rig off rocks at Dalmore beach, near Carloway, on the west side of Lewis. The structure was then towed to a temporary anchorage on the east side of the island. A decision on the future of the rig, which was destined for a yard in Turkey to be scrapped, has still to be taken. Ms Tervoort will give her talk and answer questions in the seminar at Lews Castle College UHI in Stornoway on Wednesday. After running aground in 2012, the Costa Concordia cruise liner lay partially submerged off the Italian island of Giglio for more than two years before it was refloated and scrapped.","completion":"Sylvia Tervoort, a woman who refloated a big ship and a drilling rig, will talk about her adventures at a college soon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Usually when leaving a company, notifying your manager is good enough. However, if a situation has already involved Human Resources (such as a dispute with your manager or a harassment issue), request that a representative from Human Resources be present. It is easier to request a face to face meeting if you work in the same office or can easily travel to a common location (as you may do for other meetings). If either your manager or Human Resources are not readily reachable in person, you may request a phone call or video conference. It is not essential to fly or drive over 4 hours to break the news. When requesting a meeting, say “I would like to have a short meeting with you to discuss something. When is a time good today?” You do not need to say you are leaving your job at this point. Start off by thanking anyone present for taking the time to meet with you. Then, politely express that you have chosen to leave the company. Give your last date of employment. A 2-week notice is considered customary and professional. However, if the situation is serious as with a harassment issue, you may be waived the 2 week notice requirement. When you come into a meeting with strong, upsetting emotions, it is difficult to have a productive meeting. The meeting may become high-tension and leave both parties upset. This is not the best way to leave your job. It is important to remain as calm as possible, even if it pains you to do so. This means not to discuss all the negatives about your job. Keep it simple and short by briefly stating your reasons for leaving and move on. For example, if you are leaving because a conflict with you manager, do not say, “I am leaving because my manager is mean and doesn’t understand me.\\" Instead, you can say, “I am leaving due to conflict in management style and (your manager’s name) would agree this work relationship is not working out”. You may provide constructive criticism during an exit interview. If your company does not conduct exit interviews, you can ask your manager or Human Resources if you can provide suggestions on how to improve the company. If they decline, do not insist. If the company does want to hear your suggestions: Provide valuable suggestions or constructive criticism so that the company can retain its other employees. For example, if you left because of harassment, you can say “It would be good for the employees if the company provided additional harassment training“. If you are leaving and already have a new job, it is OK to disclose the name of the new company and your new title. However, if you start discussing details such as your new responsibilities, it may seem like you are bragging and can leave a bad impression. Many jobs provide valuable knowledge and experience to help you advance your career. Even if you are leaving due to an unpleasant situation, it is important to recognize this fact and thank your manager for the opportunity. This will leave a good lasting impression. Your letter should state the basic details of your resignation. Present your resignation letter at the end of your meeting. This letter will be kept in your file and should include: A sentence telling the company you are leaving. Your last date of employment. A thank you for the opportunity to work for the company. An example of a good resignation letter would be: “I wish to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Sales Manager. My last date of employment will be April 5, 2014. Thank you for the opportunity to gain valuable experience and I wish the company good luck in the future”.

Please answer the following question: This article: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial?, what is it ?

Answer:","completion":"The correct continuation can have numerous possible variations based on the context available so far. In this case where a woman is shown teaching how to properly perform the tango, it is most probable that she would demonstrate a key aspect of the dance, like moving her feet and arms in a certain way. This could likely involve her dance partner, the man, as well. Therefore, a fitting continuation of the sentence could be: \\"She moves her feet and arms in a particular motion while the man does the same from a different angle.\\" The option showcases the intricate, mutual interaction at the heart of a dance like tango, where coordination and understanding between the two partners are key. This sentence demonstrates how the woman, presumably the more experienced dancer, leads the pair in their performance. It also subtly demonstrates the physicality and unique movement patterns of the tango, providing a basic understanding of what the dance involves. In contrast, the other options either involve movements which aren't typical of the tango (landing hand first on the ground, or using a baton), or they aim for humor or absurdity (rubbernecking straight for the camera), which may not fit into the serious, instructional context suggested by the preceding sentence. Tango is a dance that's characterized by precision and passion, not by dramatic, unsophisticated moves like headbutts or falls. Therefore, it makes much more sense for the woman to be demonstrating the refined art of tango dancing, moving her limbs in carefully choreographed patterns and guiding the man to do the same from his angle. This provides a visual and practical lesson on how the dance is performed, carrying the story forward in a logical, meaningful way."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem: Solve 0*b = -7*b + 4*b for b. And the answer is...","completion":"Okay little buddy, let's solve the equation step by step. We have: 0 * b = -7 * b + 4 * b First, we know that anything times 0 is 0, so left side of the equation is: 0 = -7 * b + 4 * b Now, let's look at the right side. We are combining two sets of b: minus 7 b's and plus 4 b's. If we subtract 4 from 7, we get: 0 = -3 * b To find the value of b, we need to make it alone on one side of the equation. To do that, we can divide both sides by -3: 0 / -3 = (-3 * b) / -3 0 divided by anything is still 0, so on the left side we have 0. And on the right side, -3 divided by -3 is 1. So we get: 0 = 1 * b Since 1 * b is just b, we can say: 0 = b So the answer is: b = 0.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles.

Article: Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose having a calm weather from the ocean happens, how will it affect less waves hit the coast. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the process The process describes the interaction between waves and the coast, including how the energy from waves contributes to the movement of sediment, and the erosion and deposition of land. This process relies on the continuous energy from waves to sustain itself. Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests a scenario in which calm weather occurs, potentially leading to less wave activity hitting the coast. Step 3: Assess the effects of the perturbation on the process By having a calm weather, there would likely be less wave activity, which directly affects the energy that pushes the water and sediment. This would result in the following changes: - Less sediment movement and erosion: With less wave energy, less sediment would be moved along the coastline, reducing the overall erosion effect. - Reduced water washing: As wave activity decreases, water would wash back the sediment less frequently or with less force, affecting sediment distribution and deposition. - Changes in sediment deposition: Sediment might be deposited in different patterns or at different locations, altering the makeup of the coast. Step 4: Determine the overall impact of the perturbation hypothesis on the process The perturbation hypothesis does have a direct effect on the process. Calm weather from the ocean, resulting in less wave activity, would directly influence the energy of waves hitting the coast.

Despite the loss to the Cardinals, the Seahawks could still clinch the NFC West at home in a Thursday night game against the San Francisco 49ers with the Seahawks hoping to avenge the earlier loss to the 49ers. On a rainy, windy night, Seattle started off strong with RB Shaun Alexander getting a three-yard TD run for the only score of the first quarter. The 49ers offense was almost nonexistent in the first half, as seven of San Francisco's first eight drives ended in three-and-outs. However, the Seahawks still allowed a 39-yard field goal by Niners kicker Joe Nedney near the end of the half. After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle's defense started giving way. 49ers QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Davis combined with an excellent kickoff return by Nate Burleson gave Seattle prime field position at the San Francisco 33-yard line. However, the Seahawks failed to convert on a fourth down play on the first series from scrimmage, and turned the ball over on downs.

In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools. The mother tongue movement in Taiwan even influenced Xiamen (Amoy) to the point that in 2010, Xiamen also began to implement the teaching of Hokkien dialect in its schools. In 2007, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan also completed the standardization of Chinese characters used for writing Hokkien and developed Tai-lo as the standard Hokkien pronunciation and romanization guide. A number of universities in Taiwan also offer Hokkien degree courses for training Hokkien-fluent talents to work for the Hokkien media industry and education. Taiwan also has its own Hokkien literary and cultural circles whereby Hokkien poets and writers compose poetry or literature in Hokkien on a regular basis. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What year did Taiwan begin teaching Hokkien in schools?","completion":"Taiwan began teaching Hokkien in schools in 1993."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The river Cochirleanca is a tributary of the Slatina river in Romania . The Cochirleanca River is a tributary of the Slatina River in Romania .","completion":"Yes, these two sentences from Wikipedia have the same meaning. They both convey that the Cochirleanca River is a tributary of the Slatina River in Romania. The slight differences in sentence structure and capitalization do not alter the intended meaning. In the first sentence: \\"The river Cochirleanca is a tributary of the Slatina river in Romania.\\" The word \\"river\\" comes before \\"Cochirleanca\\" and \\"Slatina,\\" but is only capitalized in the case of \\"Cochirleanca.\\" This phrasing is still understood, and the sentence's meaning remains clear. The word \\"river\\" is used to indicate the type of body of water, and \\"Cochirleanca\\" and \\"Slatina\\" are the names of the specific rivers being referred to. Essentially, this sentence is stating that the Cochirleanca River flows into the Slatina River, and both are located within Romania. In the second sentence: \\"The Cochirleanca River is a tributary of the Slatina River in Romania.\\" The word \\"River\\" is capitalized and comes after \\"Cochirleanca\\" and \\"Slatina.\\" This is a more standard way of writing the names of rivers, as the word \\"River\\" is capitalized and used as a proper noun, combined with the specific river names. This structure explicitly delineates the two rivers being discussed while maintaining the meaning that the Cochirleanca River flows into the Slatina River in Romania. In conclusion, despite minor differences in structure and capitalization, both sentences convey the identical meaning: the Cochirleanca River is a tributary of the Slatina River in Romania. The distinctions in phrasing do not alter the main message that these specific rivers are connected within the same geographical region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Water can be a liquid, a solid or a gas. When it is a solid, it can be as hard as stone. When it is a liquid, it can run through your fingers. When it is a gas, you may not see or feel it. Water can change from a solid to a liquid or to a gas easily. This is why we always have fresh water. Now let us find out how it does. The heat of the sun turns liquid water into gas from the oceans, seas, rivers and lakes. The heat also turns liquid water into gas from the ground, the plants and the animals. Water in the gas rises and turns into clouds in the air. When the clouds come near a mountain, they rise high. As the clouds rise, they get cooler. The higher they rise, the cooler they become. Then more and more water gas turn into water drops. In this way, the drops of water in the clouds get bigger and bigger.

The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.

Question: what is a forward in soccer I found the following answer on Google: A New Zealand forward (in white) takes a shot on goal against Cameroon in the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"No, your answer from Google isn't a complete and correct explanation of what a forward is in soccer. While it indeed shows the forward in action during a match, it does not actually explain their role or responsibilities on the pitch. A forward in soccer, also known as a striker, is a player who is primarily responsible for scoring goals. Their positioning on the field is typically towards the opposing team's goal, ahead of the other players. The main idea behind this position is to stay close to the opponent's goal to be ready for scoring opportunities. This position is often considered the most glamorous and gets a lot of attention because they are usually the game's main goal scorers. The role of a forward can be further divided into center forwards and wide forwards. A center forward usually stays centrally in the field, close to the opponent's box, trying to turn passes into a scoring opportunity. On the other hand, wide forwards (also known as wingers) ply their trade near the sidelines where they can exploit the flanks, make crosses to center forwards, or take a shot at the goal. Forwards need certain skills to effectively execute their role. They must have excellent ball control, quick speed, strong physicality to maintain possession under pressure, and a great understanding of positioning to be at the right place at the right time. Above all, they require a keen eye for goal and be adept at finishing - whether it's a powerful shot from outside the box or a subtle touch in a one-on-one scenario with the goalkeeper. So, while the Google answer you found gives an instance of a forward in action, to understand the concept clearly, it's important to know about their role, positioning, and the required skills. At the same time, remember, the responsibilities of a forward can vary based on team strategy and the coach's instructions. Consequently, while a forward's primary job is to score goals, they are also often involved in building up play and helping in defense, especially in modern football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house. The BCA has suggested strict sales regulations and contracts to ease house-owners' sufferings. It has urged the authorities to impose severe punishment on developers found violating building and other rules and joining hands with others to bid up property prices, About 41.2 percent of the respondents have complained that their house have defective designs, while nearly 40 percent say the lighting and ventilation are far from satisfactory.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Ok, let me explain this to you like you are five years old! A very, very long time ago, people called Peking Man lived near where Beijing is today. They learned how to use fire to keep warm and have light.

These people made pretty things out of silk and used special symbols to write. Next came the Shang Dynasty, where people made beautiful art with bronze.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? A. not enough information B. Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US. C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. D. Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","completion":"C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. The politics regarding gun rights in the United States is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. At the core of this contentious issue is the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides the right to own or carry a gun for law-abiding citizens. This right traces its origins back to English common law, emphasizing self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to defend the state. On one side of the debate, there are gun control advocates who argue that there should be stricter laws and regulations to help reduce gun-related violence and the number of mass shootings in the country. They often point to the fact that the current system has significant loopholes. For example, background checks are not required for private sales, including those at gun shows. Additionally, certain individuals, such as convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses, and non-U.S. citizens, are banned from owning weapons, but the system to enforce this is imperfect. On the other side, gun rights advocates, including organizations like the National Rifle Association (NRA), resist attempts at imposing stricter gun regulations. They view such regulations as an infringement on their constitutional rights and an ineffective solution to the problem of gun violence. They argue that responsible gun ownership is a fundamental right, and they often emphasize the importance of self-defense and protection of one's home and family. This political divide is evident in campaigns like Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day, which has garnered widespread support from civic organizations, politicians, and celebrities, while being criticized as \\"pointless\\" by the NRA and other gun rights advocates. It is important to note that many individuals have varying opinions on what should be done about shootings in the U.S., and there is no single solution that will satisfy everyone.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must carefully analyze the statement and concepts presented. The premise sets up a scenario involving reptiles and focuses on their hissing and flaring nostrils. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a proposed trait of these reptiles - having scales. We must now determine if this hypothesis is necessarily true based on the provided premise. Let's examine the two parts of the premise. 1. The reptiles hissed: This statement provides information about the sound these reptiles were making, which indicates their potential mood or reaction to a situation. However, this piece of information does not provide any insight into whether they have scales. There are many different species of reptiles with a wide range of physical features, and many reptiles can produce hissing sounds. 2. Flaring gigantic nostrils: This part of the premise gives us some specific information about the reptiles' physical appearance, indicating that they have visibly large nostrils. Just like the hissing, this characteristic can be found in a variety of reptile species. Nonetheless, it does not necessarily imply the presence of scales as an inherent trait of these reptiles. The hypothesis states that the reptiles had scales. While it is true that many reptiles possess scales as one of their defining features, it is not necessarily true that all reptiles must have scales. In fact, there are few reptiles like some geckos that lack scales and have smooth, almost velvety skin. The presence or absence of scales is not determined or implied by the information provided in the premise. Taking the above analysis into account, it can be concluded that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only mentions the reptiles' sounds and the appearance of their nostrils, not providing any necessary connection to the presence of scales.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Honestly, this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies I have ever seen. Partly, because it takes itself so seriously, as opposed to regular light hearted trash, this movies wants you to be emotionally involved, to feel for the characters, and to care about the alleged conspiracy. None of this ever even comes close to happening. ****MILD SPOILERS****** There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Incoherent and totally non-sensical plot. 2.) Annoying style-over-substance \\"MTV\\" camerawork. 3.) Moronic characters and plot holes. Allow me to elaborate. 1.) Apparently, when this movies was being made, they couldn't decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies, the stigmata, or possession. So, guess what? They combined them! An aetheist gets possessed by a dead person, who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy. How a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained, nor even talked about. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives her the Stigmata. WHY? Why not just spit it out? Instead, we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices, carving cryptic messages on cars, and writing messages on walls. Apparently this priest was also a violent guy, because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters, while talking in that cliched, harsh, \\"possessed\\" voice that we all have heard countless times. This also starts to tie into my second complaint, because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata, she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air, and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake? Why does this happen? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director thought it looked \\"cool\\". 2.) This movies contains dozens of shots, in slow motion, of course, of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off, and most annoyingly, of water dripping. This woman's apartment is constantly dripping water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place would probably fall apart with this many holes. To sum up this complaint, towards the end, and for absolutely no reason, the camera cuts to shots of water dripping, in slow motion, in reverse!! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has no relevance to anything, and once again, I'm betting it's because the director thought it looked \\"cool\\". 3.) One of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science. This doesn't make sense to me. I would think that going to church would be enough, but no, he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest. I just don't buy it. Secondly, there are lots of plot holes, a few of which I will elaborate on below. For starters, when she first gets the stigmata, the scene ends with her laying unconscious, bleeding. Next, she's in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another one is towards the end, when the previously mentioned \\"scientific priest\\" character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl. He says, \\"Take me as your messenger!\\" Not a word for word quote, but you get the idea. His response? \\"You have no faith, only doubt!\\" So, because of this, he possesses an aetheist! An aetheist has no faith, far less then any scientific priest! And then, there's the fact that the object of this movie's conspiracy, this Lost Gospel (of St. Thomas, I believe) is available at local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to supress this document, but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it. Maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history, where it isn't wide known, but the movie never tries to tell us this, or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document's uncovering. In closing, this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree. It is my arch-nemesis, which I feel the need to insult every chance I get. I loathe it. Final Grade: F Choose your answer.

Article: Have you ever watched the big parade on Tian'anmen Square on October 1? Some students performed in the big parade. In order to get ready for it, this summer, many Beijing middle school students had a different kind of vacation. Instead of hanging out with friends or traveling, they trained hard for the 60th birthday of China this year. Students trained from 7:30 am to around 10:00 am or from 4 pm to 6:30 pm, because it was very hot this summer. They wore white hats, T-shirts and blue trousers. The hats and T-shirts were printed with a red logo, the number \\"60\\". The first week of training was PE. Students practiced standing and squatting. Then they moved on to practice the group show. When we watched the parade on TV we saw them making colorful pictures. What did the students think of their unusual summer? \\"Sometimes we find it a bit tiring.\\" said Lu Wenqi, 13. \\"But most of us think it's a great _ to take part in such an important show.\\" Li Hui, 15, thought the same as Lu.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: What will likely happen when the teacher finishes her instructions? Options: - the children will go outside to play - the children will draw their self portrait - not enough information - the children will trace their hands === The correct answer is","completion":"- the children will draw their self portrait"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who killed Lara? Movie plot title: Django Unchained Movie plot: In 1858 Texas, the Speck brothers, Ace and Dicky, drive a group of black slaves on foot. Among the shackled slaves is Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx), sold off and separated from his wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington). The Speck brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter from DÃ¼sseldorf, who asks to buy one of the slaves. He questions Django about his knowledge of the Brittle brothers, a group of outlaws for whom Dr. Schultz is carrying a warrant. Dr. Schultz, a superior gunslinger, immediately kills Ace with a Fast draw. Dr. Schultz insists on honorably paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving him at the mercy of the newly-freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. As Django can identify the Brittle brothers, Dr. Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down. After tracking and killing the Brittles to a plantation owned by Spencer \\"Big Daddy\\" Bennett (Don Johnson), the liberated Django partners with Dr. Schultz through the winter and becomes his apprentice. They are also briefly hunted by Big Daddy but Dr. Schutlz deceives and kills most of his gang with an explosive in their carriage, as Django kills Big Daddy himself, his first kill. Dr. Schultz explains that he feels responsible for Django since Django is the first person he has ever freed, and felt morally obliged to help Django reunite with Broomhilda. Now fully trained, Django collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill for good luck. In 1859, Django and Dr. Schultz travel to Mississippi, where they learn the identity of Broomhilda's owner: Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland plantation, where slaves are forced to fight to the death in brutal wrestling matches called Mandingo fights. Dr. Schultz and Django meet Calvin at his gentleman's club in Greenville and submit their offer to buy one of his best fighters. Intrigued, Calvin invites them to his ranch at Candyland.

SpaceX's robotic Dragon capsule lifts off the pad atop the company's Falcon 9 rocket on Oct. 7, 2012, kicking off the first-ever bona fide supply run for a private American spaceship. This story was updated at 10:46 p.m. ET. CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – A privately built rocket lit up the night sky over Florida Sunday (Oct. 7) to kick off the first-ever cargo delivery trip to the International Space Station by a robotic, American-made spacecraft. The unmanned Dragon space capsule, built by the commercial spaceflight firm SpaceX, roared into space atop the company's Falcon 9 rocket from a launch pad here at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, beginning a three-day flight to the space station. Liftoff occurred at 8:35 p.m. EDT (0035 Monday GMT). The mission is the first of a dozen SpaceX cargo flights under a 1.6 billion deal with NASA for its Commercial Resupply Services program. This flight, being the first mission, is dubbed SpaceX CRS-1 and is expected to arrive at the orbiting lab on Wednesday morning (Oct. 7). NASA space station program manager Mike Suffredini said Dragon's ability to launch supplies to the station and return cargo back to Earth is a cornerstone of boosting scientific research on the orbiting laboratory, as well as its day-to-day maintenance. \\"Not to be overdramatic, but it's critical to the International Space Station,\\" Suffredini said during the countdown to launch. [Photos: Dragon Launches on 1st Space Station Cargo Trip] Sunday night's launch was nearly flawless. One of the Falcon 9 rocket nine engines apparently shut down unexpectedly during the ascent, but the booster's eight other engines compensated for the glitch and delivered the Dragon spacecraft into its intended orbit, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said after the flight. The rocket is designed to do exactly that in the event of an engine anomaly, she added. An American spaceship rises When NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, it marked the first time in 30 years that the United States did not have an American spacecraft capable of flying missions to and from low-Earth orbit. NASA is relying on the availability of new private space taxis to deliver U.S. supplies, and ultimately astronauts, to the International Space Station. Currently, the U.S. space agency depends on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to ferry crews to the station, and sends cargo on various robotic spacecraft operated by space agencies in Russia, Japan and Europe. But those unmanned space freighters are not designed to return science experiments and other station gear back to Earth. Instead, the spacecraft are disposed of in Earth's atmosphere by burning up during re-entry. That is where Dragon stands out. The gumdrop-shaped spacecraft is designed not only to haul cargo to the International Space Station but also to return hardware and experiments back to Earth. Under its terms with NASA, SpaceX has pledged to launch at least 20 metric tons of supplies to the space station during its 12-flight deal. Dragon in flight In May, the Hawthorne, Calif.–based SpaceX launched a test flight to the station using a different Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule to prove that it was ready to begin making bona fide supply runs. The demonstration was a success, paving the way for Sunday night's launch. \\"Every time we fly, we learn something,\\" Shotwell said before launch. \\"We're a launch company; I'm excited every time we get to launch.\\" For the first operational Dragon cargo mission to the station, SpaceX and NASA packed the capsule with more than 1,000 pounds (454 kilograms) of supplies, food and other vital gear for the station's current three-person Expedition 33 crew. Those supplies include a special delivery of ice cream for the astronauts, a late addition packed as a special treat. The Dragon capsule will pull up to the station on Wednesday and be grappled by astronauts using the outpost's robotic arm so it can be attached to an available docking port. After nearly three weeks at the space station, Dragon will undock for a planned Oct. 28 splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California, where it will be retrieved by a SpaceX recovery crew. [6 Fun Facts About SpaceX's Dragon Spacecraft] The space station's three-person crew watched SpaceX's smooth Dragon launch live via a video feed beamed up by flight controllers. At the time of launch, the station was sailing 225 miles above Tasmania, NASA officials said. \\"We are ready to grab Dragon!\\" the station's commander, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, radioed down to Mission Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston along with congratulations for the SpaceX team. NASA also confirmed today that a piece of space junk that will fly near the station Monday won't interfere with the crew's work preparing for Dragon's arrival, agency officials said. The Dragon capsule is expected to return more than 2,000 pounds (907 kg) of science experiment results and station hardware so they can be studied or — in the case of the hardware — upgraded or repaired, station managers said. SpaceX's Dragon capsules are 14.4 feet tall (4.4 meters) and about 12 feet wide (3.6 m). They rely on two solar panels for power, making them the first American solar-powered spacecraft to visit the International Space Station. SpaceX has also received NASA funding to develop a manned version of Dragon as part of the agency's private space taxi efforts. Building a vehicle capable of carrying astronauts into space has long been a goal of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who founded the company in 2002. Shotwell said SpaceX expects to be ready to fly astronauts on Dragon spacecraft by 2015. SpaceX is one of two companies with a NASA contract to provide unmanned cargo delivery flights to the space station. The other firm is the Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp., which has a 1.9 billion deal for at least eight resupply flights to the station using its new Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. Unlike Dragon, Orbital's Cygnus is not designed to return supplies to Earth. The first Antares rocket test flight is expected later this year from a launch site in Virginia.

Ice cream is blasting off for the crew of the International Space Station (ISS). The frozen confectionery — not the freeze-dried souvenir version sold in museum gift shops — is packed on board the first NASA-contracted commercial mission to resupply the orbiting laboratory. The Commercial Resupply Services-1 (CRS-1) mission is scheduled to lift off on a Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Falcon 9 rocket on Sunday (Oct. 7) at 8:35 p.m. EDT (0035 GMT Oct. 8) from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The ice cream, which is now a not-so-secret surprise for the station's current three member crew, was confirmed as on board SpaceX's Dragon cargo capsule by NASA after a pre-launch press conference Saturday (Oct. 6) raised the possibility that it was included. \\"We talked about flying ice cream,\\" said NASA's manager for the space station program, Michael Suffredini. \\"We try to bring up what we call 'bonus food' for the crew, and this is one of those flights that will have that.\\" [Space Food Photos: What Astronauts Eat in Orbit] GLACIER goodies The vanilla with swirled chocolate sauce ice cream cups won't melt on their three-day journey to the space station thanks to a freezer on board the Dragon capsule. \\"We're very excited,\\" SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell told reporters. \\"This is the first time we are taking powered cargo up. We are taking up a GLACIER freezer, which has refrigerated science samples in it.\\" The GLACIER, or General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator, is primarily used to preserve science samples that require temperatures between minus 301 and 39 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 and 4 degrees Celsius) on the way to or from the space station. The mini-fridge sized freezer previously flew aboard the space shuttle. \\"Having been on a flight that had an empty freezer on it going up into space, we did fill it [with ice cream] and it's really nice!\\" Robert Cabana, former shuttle astronaut and the director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, said. The CRS-1 flight is launching with more than 800 pounds (360 kilograms) of supplies, experiments and equipment to support the space station's crew, and will return to Earth with nearly 1,700 pounds (770 kg) of science results and spent hardware. SpaceX's Dragon capsule is designed to splashdown in the ocean and be recovered. The mission is the first of a dozen supply flights for which NASA is paying SpaceX 1.6 billion to fly. This launch follows a demonstration flight in May that made history as the first commercial spacecraft to berth with the station.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? OPT: (I). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases. (II). As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases. (III). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. (IV). As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases.","completion":"The correct answer to the question is: (III). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. To understand why this statement is correct, we first need to discuss the basic properties of stars and the concept of apparent brightness. Stars emit light due to the nuclear reactions happening in their cores. The amount of light that a star emits is referred to as its luminosity. Apparent brightness, on the other hand, is the amount of light we observe from a star as seen from Earth. It is important to note that apparent brightness is affected not only by the star's intrinsic luminosity but also by its distance from Earth. Now, let's examine each statement provided in the question: (I). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases. This statement is incorrect because the size of a star is an inherent property that does not change with distance. The distance from Earth only affects the star's apparent size in the sky, not its actual size. (II). As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases. Similar to the first statement, this one is also incorrect for the same reasons. The actual size of a star remains constant, and increasing or decreasing the distance from Earth does not change its size. (III). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. This statement is correct. When the distance between a star and Earth decreases, the star appears brighter because the light it emits has less space to spread out before reaching us. This is explained by the inverse square law of light, which states that the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. (IV). As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases. This statement is incorrect because it contradicts the inverse square law of light. As the distance from the star to Earth increases, the apparent brightness of the star decreases, not increases, because the light has more space to spread out before reaching us. So, the correct answer to the question is statement (III), which states that as the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. This relationship between distance and apparent brightness is fundamental to our understanding of how we observe and measure the properties of stars in the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By knowing that we're talking about skiers, we understand that the context likely involves winter sports or recreational activities. 2. \\"Edge\\": The word \\"edge\\" provides information about the skiers' specific location. They are not simply on the balcony, but rather at its edge, which implies that they may be taking a closer look or observing something beneath them. It also adds a sense of suspense or excitement to the situation. 3. \\"Balcony\\": This word gives us the primary setting of the scene, letting us know where the skiers are – on a balcony. This helps us visualize the scene and gives us context for their actions. Since they are on a balcony, we can assume that they are at some elevation relative to the slopes. 4. \\"Slopes\\": This word informs us about the subject matter of the skiers' observation – the slopes below. This further helps clarify the context of the sentence, as we can now visualize the scene more accurately, with the skiers looking down from a higher vantage point to observe the snow-covered slopes.

Elizabeth Masterson, a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what are most canyons caused by?\\" is \\"physical weathering\\", given that most canyons are formed by flowing water? A:","completion":"While \\"physical weathering\\" partially contributes to the formation of canyons, it may not be the most accurate answer to the question \\"what are most canyons caused by?\\" given that most canyons are indeed formed by flowing water, specifically through the continuous and long-term action of erosion. Erosion refers to the process where the natural elements wear away at the earth's surface, and it mainly involves water, wind, and ice. In the case of canyons, water is the leading agent. To provide more context, let's explore the intricate process of canyon formation, which typically involves a combination of erosion, weathering, and other geological processes. 1. Erosion by flowing water: As water flows through a river or a stream, it carries sediments and rock particles with it. Over time, this moving water erodes the landscape, cutting deeper into the earth's surface. The erosional force exerted by the water becomes stronger as the volume and speed of the water increase, which is why canyons are commonly found in arid regions with occasional flash floods that rapidly concentrate large volumes of water within narrow channels. 2. Physical weathering: While the primary force behind canyon formation is erosion, physical weathering plays a supporting role. Physical weathering, also known as mechanical weathering, involves the breakdown of rocks and minerals through processes such as freeze-thaw cycles, thermal expansion and contraction, and abrasion. These processes can weaken the rock formations, making it easier for the erosional force of water to remove and transport sediments. 3. Chemical weathering: In addition to physical weathering, chemical weathering also contributes to canyon formation. Chemical weathering occurs when the minerals within rocks react with water, air, and other chemicals, leading to the alteration or dissolution of the rock. This process further weakens the rock formations, facilitating their removal by flowing water. 4. Tectonic activity: In some cases, geological processes such as the movement of tectonic plates can contribute to canyon formation. Uplift of the earth's crust can create steep river gradients, encouraging rapid stream erosion. In other cases, faulting can lead to stream capture and the formation of deep, narrow canyons along fault lines. 5. Differential erosion: Canyons typically develop in areas where the rock layers have varying degrees of resistance to erosion. Water will erode softer, less resistant rocks more quickly than harder, more resistant rocks. This results in a continuous deepening and widening process that ultimately leads to the formation of a canyon. In conclusion, although physical weathering does play a part in the formation of canyons, it is not the main cause. The most accurate answer to the question \\"what are most canyons caused by?\\" would be the action of flowing water via erosion. This dominant process, along with other contributing factors such as physical and chemical weathering as well as tectonic activity, work together to create the breathtaking canyons that we witness in various parts of the world today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts. Question: \\"Who built towns, industries, roads, bridges, and developed agriculture to influence all of Iberia?\\" Response: \\"Moors\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

The biggest project is Mission Hills Hainan, a vast undertaking that when finished will have at least 10 courses and cover an area nearly one and a half times the size of Manhattan. Environmentalists are alarmed by the potentially damaging effects of golf course construction on an island featuring rainforests, mountains, volcanoes and more than 300 endangered species. \\"Where does this begin and where does it end?\\" said Jonathan Smith, chief executive of the Golf Environment Organization, a non-governmental organization aimed at promoting sustainable golf. \\"What level of economic development can Hainan sustain while still having functioning ecosystems? You have to set a threshold on the level of development that can hit a region otherwise you will simply destroy its natural and cultural aspects,\\" Smith told CNN. Golf development in Hainan has gone into overdrive since January, when the state announced plans to make the island an international tourist destination by 2020, sparking a full-scale property boom. Clearwater Bay Golf Club is planning to compliment its three courses with a six or seven star hotel, while Yalong Bay Golf Club has bought the land to open a second course. But those developments are dwarfed by the scale of Mission Hills, where there are three courses, a 525-room hotel, 11 restaurants and plans for three conference rooms, three shopping malls and a spa. In October, Hollywood actors including Hugh Grant and Matthew McConaughey will join multiple major winners Greg Norman and Nick Faldo for the Mission Hills Star Trophy, with the winner set to scoop 1.28 million. The sheer scale of development has also raised eyebrows at international environmental activists Greenpeace. \\"Because Hainan is known for its vast and dense rainforest, it is very important to China and to the world,\\" Yi Lan, a forest campaigner for Greenpeace China, told CNN. \\"Any large-scale construction of golf courses would damage the local ecosystem. \\"We are very concerned about the rapid development of golf courses in Hainan and we think the local government should take strong measures to ensure the golf projects do not damage the local ecosystems.\\" Dan Washburn, a China-based journalist who has visited the Mission Hills complex in Hainan, says although the development mostly occupies an area designated as wasteland, fruit trees have been uprooted and local residents displaced from their homes. He told CNN: \\"I met with the head of a local environmental group who thought he had secured rights to open up a forest park on part of the land. They had worked for years to get approvals from the government and local village groups. \\"Then, all of a sudden, they were told their plans had been shelved. They soon found out the reason why. It was because of the Mission Hills project.\\" Mission Hills, which also owns a massive 12-course golf complex in Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland, say their Hainan project has created thousands of jobs and was subject to stringent environmental impact assessments. \\"Mission Hills has always strived to balance economic benefits to the community with proper stewardship of the environment,\\" Dr Ken Chu, Group Executive Vice Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer of the Mission Hills Group, told CNN by email. \\"By incorporating low-density development with vast open-space greenbelts, our current project in Haikou has transformed a barren, lava-rock landscape into an economically productive community.\\" Their claims are backed up by the local government, with spokesman Mr. Zhao telling CNN that the location of the complex followed \\"careful\\" investigation. \\"Therefore, the project will not pollute the environment,\\" he said. But those statements are not enough to pacify environmental groups, with Greenpeace vowing to investigate the case. \\"You have to say that the Mission Hills developments have been high-impact in environmental terms,\\" says Smith. \\"You can't deny that when there's the level of earth-shifting and movement of land form that there has been in the previous development. It's large-scale and each development couldn't really be defined as light touch. \\"Then you have the longer-term concerns over where does the water come from, where does the energy come from? Is it all fossil fuels? How much energy is required to desalinate or treat the sewage water?\\" Shane Templeton, a golf course consultant on Hainan for six years, says the sport can bring huge benefits to the island's economy if it is kept in balance with the local infrastructure. \\"Golf is great for Hainan and it's a vehicle for bringing a lot of foreign exchange, but it's got to be done carefully and within reason,\\" he told CNN. \\"I don't know who is regulating these people. You don't want 50 golf courses but no buses and no sewage systems -- it's got to grow together with everything.\\" Smith wants to see an end to the clandestine culture surrounding golf course construction in China. \\"What we would like to see is more transparency,\\" he said. \\"We would like to see the government's plans for the levels of development in Hainan clearly depicted so that people can understand the levels and type of development that are likely to take place in such regions.\\" \\"There comes a point, particularly on an island setting, where too much development puts too much pressure on the natural resources, and the cultural heritage and the landscape of that particular region.\\"","completion":"China's push to turn Hainan, its only tropical island, into a golfing paradise is creating controversy among environmental groups. Luxury golf resorts, like Mission Hills Hainan, are being developed rapidly in an attempt to transform the island into the \\"Hawaii of the East\\". The scale of construction has raised concerns among environmentalists about the potential damage to the region's rainforests, mountains, volcanoes, and over 300 endangered species. Hainan features rich, dense rainforests, making it a significant part of China and the world's ecosystem. The rapid expansion of golf courses on the island has Greenpeace urging the local government to implement strong measures ensuring these developments do not cause harm to the local ecosystems. While some believe that golf tourism can contribute positively to Hainan's economy, it should be done in balance with the methods for preserving local infrastructure and the environment. Environmental groups, such as the Golf Environment Organization, call for more transparency in golf course developments and the government's plans for the sustainable growth of Hainan to maintain its natural resources, culture, and heritage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some years ago a woman on our staff came into my office to, basically, tell me off and complain to me about others and about myself. This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable.

Question 1: To get medium-sized muscles, we need to eat healthy food and exercise. A good diet includes eating a balance of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins like chicken and fish, and some healthy fats. Also, doing exercises like jumping, running, and playing games that use our muscles can help. But remember, the diet and muscle size will depend on each person's body and activity level.

Roger Federer (German pronunciation: ['rodZ@r 'fe:d@r@r]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 2 in men's singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He is regarded by many fans, players and analysts as the greatest tennis player of all time. Federer has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles--the most in history for a male player--and has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 308 weeks, including 237 consecutive weeks. After turning professional in 1998, he was continuously ranked in the top ten from October 2002 to November 2016. The 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career. In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as statistically the second-best season of all time during the Open Era, behind Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969. Federer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92-5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season. In 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the French Open. This was Federer and Nadal's first meeting in a Grand Slam final. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Federer defeated Nadal in the Wimbledon Championships final. In the Australian Open, Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis, and at the US Open, Federer defeated Roddick (2003 champion). In addition, Federer made it to six ATP Masters Series 1000 finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker. Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1. Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old Andy Murray in the second round of the 2006 Cincinnati Masters, in what would be Federer's only defeat before reaching the final of a tournament that year. Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open. A personal highlight for Federer came near the end of the season when he won his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runners up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would rad B more likely or less likely make atmosphere warmer than rad A? Mark was studying the effect of Sun's radiations on Earth. To that end, he studied Sun's radiations, which he labeled as rad A. Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat. Hint: Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. Answer:","completion":"Rad B would be less likely to make the atmosphere warmer than rad A. This is because rad A represents the Sun's radiations (solar radiation), which has shorter wavelengths and contains more energy compared to rad B, which represents Earth's radiations emitted back into space at longer wavelengths. The shorter wavelengths of rad A are more effective at producing heat, while the energy in longer wavelengths of rad B is weaker. Additionally, part of the incoming solar radiation (rad A) is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to its warming, while some of the emitted Earth radiation (rad B) gets reflected or absorbed by the atmosphere and does not contribute as much to the atmospheric warming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Help as much as you can. Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Each year, about 10,000 to 100,000 animal species die off. They join the countless species that have gone extinct over the course of Earth's history - and extinction means forever. At least it used to. Scientists are now closing in on the ability to bring back extinct species. No, this doesn't mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality. Researchers need DNA to bring back a species. DNA is the chemical that carries the structure for a living thing. Dinosaurs have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils. But there's a very real chance that we will be able to bring back more recently extinct species. This could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2003, a team of Spanish and French scientists re-created the Pyrenean ibex, which had gone extinct three years earlier. The new animal didn't survive long, but scientific advances should improve the success rate. In January, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing back the gastric brooding frog. That we can bring species back doesn't mean that we should. There may be benefits to reviving a species. But there's no way to know how it will turn out. For example, would a passenger pigeon fit into its old habitat? Or might it crowd out existing species? Environmentalists worry that our ability to bring species back might cut down support for the hard work of traditional conservation. Why worry about preserving a wildlife habitat or fighting poachers if we know we can just make up for our mistakes? But those extinctions are our mistakes to correct, which may give us an obligation to do so. As businessman and environmentalist Stewart Brand recently said, \\"Humans have made a huge hole in nature. We have the ability now to repair some of that damage.\\" We would do well to remember the lesson of Jurassic Park: Proceed with caution. Options: A That scientists cannot make up for the mistakes that they made in the past. B That traditional conservation might be of no use by bringing species back. C That scientists could lack the ability to bring back extinct species to life. D That species that will be brought back to life will not survive long. Answer: B That traditional conservation might be of no use by bringing species back. Question: The answer to this question is:","completion":"What is a potential concern regarding the ability to bring back extinct species?

Answer:","completion":"The character Barney, if referring to the children's television show \\"Barney & Friends,\\" was primarily portrayed by a purple anthropomorphic Tyrannosaurus rex who was brought to life by several actors and costume performers throughout the show's run from 1992 to 2009. The primary costume performers who played Barney were David Joyner and Carey Stinson, whereas the voice actors for Barney included Bob West, Duncan Brannan, and Dean Wendt. David Joyner was the first performer to don the Barney costume from the show's inception in 1992 until 2001. His role involved physically portraying Barney, meaning he was responsible for the character's actions, movements, and expressions. To bring the character to life, David Joyner wore a heavy, full-body costume that could weigh up to 70 pounds. His dedication to accurately representing Barney's physical presence contributed largely to the character's success on television. Carey Stinson was another important performer who took the role of Barney. Stinson became the primary costume performer for Barney from 2002 until the show ended in 2009. Like Joyner, Stinson's role involved physically embodying Barney, bringing energy, joy, and enthusiasm to the character's interactions with children and other characters on the show. Bob West was the primary voice of Barney from the show's beginning in 1992 until 2000. West provided the character's signature deep, gentle, and friendly voice that endeared Barney to its young audience. West helped develop the personality and expressiveness of Barney's speaking voice, including the character's costume performer David Joyner's directions on set. Following West's departure, Duncan Brannan took over the role of voicing Barney from 2000 to 2001. Brannan continued to uphold the character's warm, reassuring, and energetic vocal style that had been established by West. In 2002, Dean Wendt became the official voice of Barney and continued in that role until the end of the series in 2009. Wendt carried on the tradition of Barney's distinct voice and personality, ensuring the character remained consistent and appealing to the show's young fans. In conclusion, the portrayal of Barney was a collaborative effort between various talented costume performers and voice actors. The most significant performers were David Joyner and Carey Stinson, who physically embodied the character, and the primary voice actors, Bob West, Duncan Brannan, and Dean Wendt, who were responsible for giving Barney his recognizable and endearing speaking voice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fiona Dickie: The beauty queen now struggles to wear stilettos as a result of the crash. A beauty queen received £18,000 in damages yesterday after a car crash left her unable to wear high heels comfortably. Fiona Dickie, 24, was hit by a Suzuki 4x4 while driving, leaving her with back injuries that make slipping into stilettos a painful experience. Incredibly, despite her injuries, the 24-year-old went on to win the Miss Edinburgh competition in 2010 following the collision in April the previous year, but her ability to take part in charity events has been limited because of continuing back pain. She raised an action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh suing the other driver Mohammadreza Khandani, also of Edinburgh, for damages following the collision. Khandani admitted liability but he wanted to pay around £3,500 but Miss Dickie wanted closer to £20,000. The court heard that the accident occurred on April 10 in 2009 shortly after midnight in Edinburgh’s South Clerk Street as Miss Dickie returned home from working at a drinks promotion event. She was left shocked and distressed and suffered bruising to her chest and pain in her neck and back. The sales manager went home after the accident but later phoned NHS Direct because she was in pain. A nurse said she should consult her GP and she was subsequently referred for physiotherapy, where Miss Dickie was later diagnosed with chronic low back pain. After deciding on the £18,000 compensation today, which included £10,000 for 'pain and suffering' judge Gordon Reid QC said: 'The pursuer (Miss Dickie) is an attractive young woman and also carried out some work as a model, usually at charitable events. 'She did not wish however to have a career as a model. 'She was expected to wear high heels for this promotional work. Doing so aggravated her back.' Mr Reid said that after she won the Miss Edinburgh contest her main duty was attend and take part in charity events. 'Her ability to participate in the usual range of such events was limited because of her continuing back pain,' he said. Payout: The Edinburgh Court of Sessions, pictured, heard today that she would be getting £18,000 - £10,000 of which was for pain and suffering. 'The pursuer felt she was letting people down by not participating in as many events as, but for her back pain, she would other wise have done. She gave as an example various fun runs in which she was not able to participate. 'In spite of her attractive looks and the promotional work which she carried out the pursuer was very much against women being employed on the basis of their looks. 'She strongly opposed the WAG (wives and girlfriends) culture and part of her purpose in wishing to become Miss Edinburgh was to encourage young girls to be independent, to be their own boss and not to rely on men,' he said. 'She has adopted a sensible attitude to her continuing back problems. Sje knows she can wear high heels but will suffer the next day for doing so. It seems to me that rather than being criticised she should be commended for her efforts. 'In the present case it is abundantly plain on the evidence that since the accident she has complained of and suffered intermittent lower back pain. She did not suffer such pain before the accident. 'She is not exaggerating her injuries to enhance the value of her claim. If she is, it is a strange way of going about it. She returned to work, resumed part-time employment over and above her day job and continued her modelling and charity work,' he said. The judge awarded her a total of pounds 18,281, including pounds 10,000 for her pain and suffering. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Beauty queen Fiona Dickie was awarded £18,000 in damages after a car accident left her with back injuries that made it difficult for her to wear high heels comfortably.

Holly Gent Palmo and Vincent Palmo Jr. adapted the film's screenplay from Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name about a teenager (in reality, the 15-year-old Arthur Anderson, who played Lucius in Welles' production) involved in the founding of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. After receiving funding from CinemaNX, a production company backed by the Isle of Man film fund, and an offer from Framestore Features to co-finance the film, Richard Linklater came on board to direct Me and Orson Welles. Zac Efron signed on as the lead in early January 2008, claiming he decided to take the role of Richard Samuels because \\"It's a completely different project than I've ever done before,\\" while Claire Danes joined the cast as the protagonist's love interest Sonja Jones in late January. In the theatre, Christian McKay had portrayed Orson Welles in the one-man play Rosebud: The Lives of Orson Welles at a number of venues, including the Edinburgh Festival and King's Head (London). He reprised the role in the U.S. at the 2007 \\"Brits Off Broadway\\" festival, where Linklater saw his performance and then cast McKay as Welles, retaining him over the subsequent objections of the project's producer. Me and Orson Welles underwent filming in the Isle of Man, Pinewood Studios, London and New York from February to April 2008. Filming in London commenced first in mid-February, before scenes in the Isle of Man were shot February 24-March 14, 2008, where filming locations included Gaiety Theatre and various other parts of Douglas. During filming in Douglas, Efron and Danes believe they sighted a ghost, or \\"supernatural\\" being, outside a window on set at Gaiety Theatre. Filming in Britain resumed in late March for six weeks at Pinewood Studios. Other locations included Crystal Palace Park, where a facade of New York's Mercury Theatre was set up for a scene. Actor James Tupper claimed that the best replica of an old New York theater was in England, while many of the actors who filled the company were from the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production crew only briefly visited New York; photographs were taken and footage shot to be added into the film as digital effects.

Information: - Bloomsbury is an area in the West End, central London, forming part of the London Borough of Camden and located between Euston Road and Holborn. It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton. - Buckland including Buckland Valley is a village near ( and now merged with ) Dover , England . It is noted for its Saxon cemetery whose finds now belong to the British Museum but are on display at Dover Museum . English railway contractor , Edward Betts , was born in Buckland . - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - The British Museum is dedicated to human history, art and culture, and is located in the Bloomsbury area of London. Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works, is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Cambridge native Jimmy Tingle has been a fixture on Boston’s comedy scene since the 1980s. Twenty years ago, Jimmy Tingle shifted his career into DIY mode when he rented out the Hasty Pudding Theatre for an extended run of his comic one-man show. He has followed that path ever since, taking on the financial risk and responsibility of running the house — almost exclusively in New England — including a five-year stint as proprietor of Jimmy Tingle’s Off-Broadway Theater in Davis Square, Somerville. When he plays New Year’s Eve at the Wilbur, that’s going to change. It’s unusual, Tingle notes in a telephone interview, for a comedian to rent a space to put on his or her own show. That business is usually handled by bookers or producers. Tingle took the initiative so he could develop the show he wanted to see and for a bigger stage. “By doing it yourself and being your own producer, it just gave you the freedom to do things,” he says. “If I had to wait for a producer for that to happen, I probably never would have gotten into that theater.” Tingle, 60, is still working social media and promoting the show. But for the most part he’s just the talent for the Wilbur gig. He mainly has to worry about being funny. “It’s great to be working at the Wilbur because they just do so much and that’s all they do, they’re a producing house,” he says. “Hopefully it’ll lead to other places where you just go in and do your thing, you don’t have to worry about everything else.” It would be hard to imagine Boston comedy without Tingle. The Cambridge native has been a fixture since the much ballyhooed comedy boom of the ’80s. And he has stuck close to home in large part for domestic reasons. “I never really wanted to be on the road while we’re starting a family,” says Tingle. “I didn’t want my wife to be a single parent. And this is such a great area for what I do. There’s millions of people in this Greater Boston area. And it’s just been a great place to perform, work. The sensibilities of the people that live here, we have very similar sensibilities. So it was easy and it was comfortable, and it is comfortable to stay.” Tingle and his wife, Catherine, celebrated their 20th anniversary in November, and just sent their son, Seamus, to college. He and his wife are empty nesters, Tingle notes, which gives him more freedom to expand his range in 2016. “I hope to be traveling more,” he says. To that end, Tingle has been getting advice from former Boston producer Barry Katz, who worked with a slew of well-known comedians, including Dane Cook, Bill Burr, and Louis C.K., early in their careers. Tingle was scheduled to head to Los Angeles the day after he spoke with the Globe to be a guest on Katz’s podcast, “Industry Standard,” and Jay Mohr’s “Mohr Stories.” Tingle did a handful of podcasts under his “Humor for Humanity” banner this year, some of which have not yet aired. He’ll bring that back in 2016. “I’m interested in utilizing the technology that’s available to do my own thing,” says Tingle, “and trying to go to another level of commitment in terms of that.” Podcasting takes some getting used to for a comedian conditioned to pull laughter from a live audience. The Humor for Humanity mission statement is “more than entertainment — raising spirits, funds, and awareness for nonprofits, charities, and social causes.” That goes for the podcast as well as the live shows (part of the proceeds for the Wilbur show will go to Globe Santa). That can be a hard balance to strike on a podcast when you’re talking about serious subjects with guests from food pantries or the Red Cross. “I forget, oh yeah, it’s ‘Humor for Humanity,’ ” he says. “That’s kind of the needle I’m trying to thread there. How to be consistent with the entertainment part as well as the content part.” Tingle won’t be ignoring his local roots. A lot of his work live and with the podcast will benefit New England-based organizations. But he does want the podcast to have more of a national appeal eventually. He compares developing a podcast to paying dues as a local comic. “You don’t develop, really, onstage in LA or New York,” he says. “You develop someplace regionally where you can experiment and practice and get your sea legs. Then you go to New York or LA.” JIMMY TINGLE!

Please answer this question: the three core concepts of expectancy violations theory are?","completion":"To answer this question, I will first explain what Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT) is, then outline the three core concepts of the theory. Step 1: Explain Expectancy Violations Theory Expectancy Violations Theory, developed by Judee K. Burgoon, is a communication theory that seeks to explain how individuals respond to unexpected behaviors from others in social interactions. EVT posits that we have expectations about how others should behave based on social norms, context, and personal experiences. When these expectations are violated, it can lead to positive or negative evaluations and reactions. Step 2: Identify and explain the three core concepts of EVT 1. Expectancy: Expectancy refers to our beliefs about how others will behave in a given situation. These beliefs are based on factors such as social norms, personal relationships, and communication context. When someone's behavior aligns with our expectations, we tend to feel comfortable and at ease. However, when someone's behavior deviates from our expectations, we may feel surprised, confused, or even upset. 2. Violation Valence: Violation valence refers to the positive or negative evaluation an individual assigns to an expectancy violation. This evaluation is subjective and may depend on various factors, such as the relationship between the individuals involved, the nature of the unexpected behavior, and the specific context in which the interaction occurs. In some cases, a violation may be perceived as a positive development - for instance, if a reserved person becomes unexpectedly outgoing in a social setting. On the other hand, a violation might be seen as negative if someone is inappropriately intrusive in a private matter. 3. Communicator Reward Valence: Communicator reward valence refers to the positive or negative attributes that an individual associates with the person committing the expectancy violation. This evaluation affects how the expectancy violation is perceived and may influence the individual's response to the violation. For example, if an individual perceives the violator as a high-reward person - someone with high social status, attractiveness, or a close relationship - they may be more likely to excuse the unexpected behavior or even see it as positive. Conversely, if the violator is perceived as low in reward value, the expectancy violation may result in unfavorable judgments or negative reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The question doesn't mention any reason for the animals to feel pain or discomfort. Hence, \\"feel pain\\" is not the correct answer. 2. The ability to fly is not related to the animals being by the river or their thirst, so \\"fly\\" is not the correct answer. 3. \\"Pass water\\" refers to the animals crossing the river or possibly urinating. This can be considered as the animals interact with the river in some way, even though they are not thirsty. It seems to be the most logical answer among the given choices for the animals' activity by the river. 4. \\"Die of cancer\\" is unrelated to the animals being by the river and their thirst, so effectively it's not the correct answer. 5. The question doesn't give any indication that the animals were experiencing pleasure while being by the river, so \\"feel pleasure\\" is not a valid answer.

Question: How did education impact the country? Context: The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme). Answer:","completion":"Education impacted the country by playing a crucial role in shaping the future leaders and administrators of the Ottoman Empire.

The Madrasa educated Muslim scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition, allowing children from poor families to rise to higher social levels and increase their income, as its financial burden was supported by vakifs. On the other hand, the Enderûn was a free boarding school for Christian boys, recruiting students annually from the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans. This process, known as Devshirme (Devşirme), enabled the Empire to assimilate and educate young Christian boys, shaping them into loyal, skilled administrators and helping to maintain the vast and multi-ethnic empire's stability.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Barend was: A. handsom kid B. boring looking kid C. not enough information D. smart kid Answer:","completion":"B. boring looking kid"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

However, they then mention having visited casinos in Vegas and Macau more frequently than the Montreal casino over the last 10 years.

Write a text based on this summary: calcutta prisoners demand to see ipl telecasts Text:","completion":"Title: Prisoners in Calcutta Petition for IPL Telecasts Within Penitentiary Walls In an unexpected move, a group of prisoners housed in the Calcutta penitentiary has sparked a conversation about rights and leisure for those behind bars. This group has launched a formal demand to be allowed to watch the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches live on television. This sudden appeal by some of Calcutta's incarcerated residents throws light on the commonly overlooked aspect of prisoners' rights to recreation and entertainment. Their demand for access to IPL telecasts, a premier sporting event religiously followed by millions of cricket enthusiasts, might sound audacious to many. However, it starts a conversation on the quality of life within prisons. The IPL, a highly popular annual cricket league played in India, has an extensive fan base ranging from ordinary citizens to individuals of high influence. The excitement and cheers that rounds of cricket generate give an inkling as to why the prisoners raised their voice for IPTV broadcast access within their otherwise restrained and monotone lives. Initially, this unique request bewildered the prison authorities. To them, the very idea that prisoners were seeking permission to enjoy a luxury like the IPL seemed unprecedented and far-fetched. However, prison officials are mandated to assess the implications of this demand in a broader perspective, considering the rules against televised privileges in prison system of Calcutta. The prisoners' argument lies in the belief that access to IPL matches will provide a respite from their monotonous routine and might even boost their morale. According to them, decent treatment must not only be towards developing skill sets and preparing them for a life after prison, but it should also involve opportunities for recreation and temporary relief from their constrained lives. Ensuing debates cropped up between prison reform campaigners and those against such prisoner-centric proposals. Advocates for reform stood firm on the notion that such activities could act as a reform measure, encouraging better behavior and thus keeping the prison environment more harmonious. On the other side, opponents argue that such luxuries present an unwarranted deviation from what should be a punitive environment. Should the authorities permit the broadcasting of IPL matches in the prisons, it would undoubtedly be a topic of national discussion. It would invariably set a precedent for future engagements involving penal institutions and the quality of life within them. The outcome of this landmark demand can potentially redefine the concept of punishment and rehabilitation in India, a country with a bulging prison population. Consequently, the fledgling movement by the prisoners in Calcutta isn't merely about watching cricket. It is about acknowledging the need for prison reform and addressing the living conditions of prisoners for better rehabilitation. The demand for IPL telecasts has unleashed a broader debate about human rights, decent treatment, and whether there’s a need for a paradigm shift in the way society views and treats prisoners. In simple terms, the prisoners' demand to watch IPL matches has brought about a change no one expected but might serve as the starting point for advocating higher quality treatment, not just for prisoners in Calcutta, but also for incarcerated individuals widespread across the nation. For the Indian criminal justice system, this unprecedented request may force a reassessment, propelling the administration and society closer to extensive prison reforms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nintendo Entertainment System: Encouraged by these successes, Nintendo soon turned its attention to the North American market. Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari’s name as the name Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System. The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1983. However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo's Donkey Kong game. This violation of Atari's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo's game console marketing contract with Atari. Atari's CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month, so the deal went nowhere, and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own.g[›] Please answer a question about this article.

How to get your dog to pee on command Choose a trigger word or phrase to use. When teaching a dog a command you need to come up with a verbal trigger. This should be a word or sound that indicates to the dog what you would like it to do.","completion":"Step 1: Select a consistent location for your dog to pee. Choose an area in your yard or during walks where you want your dog to regularly eliminate. Consistency is crucial in building association and helps to create a predictable routine, thereby reinforcing the learning process for your dog. Step 2: Take your dog to the designated location. Whether in your yard or during walks, lead your dog to this area each time it needs to eliminate. Step 3: Say the trigger word or phrase as your dog begins to pee. This word should be unique and used exclusively for this purpose to avoid confusing your dog. Some examples could be \\"go potty\\" or \\"do your business.\\" Step 4: Reward your dog immediately after it finishes peeing. Provide positive reinforcement, such as treats, praise, or affection, to encourage your dog to associate the action of peeing with the trigger word or phrase. Step 5: Be patient and consistent in your training. It may take several weeks for your dog to fully understand the connection between the trigger word and the action of peeing. Continue to use the same word or phrase and consistently reward your dog each time it successfully eliminates on command. Step 6: Gradually reduce the rewards. Once your dog consistently pees on command, begin to gradually decrease the frequency of rewards, moving from every time to every other time, and eventually only rewarding occasionally. This will help your dog maintain the learned behavior without becoming overly reliant on treats. By following these steps and remaining consistent in your efforts, you will be able to successfully teach your dog to pee on command, making it an invaluable skill, especially when traveling or in situations when a quick bathroom break is needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.","completion":"After reading the given paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding\\" is not true. In fact, the paragraph suggests the opposite idea: gastrointestinal bleeding can occur as a consequence of taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. NSAIDs exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). This enzyme is essential for the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are molecules that play a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation, pain, and fever. However, there are two main isoforms of the COX enzyme: COX-1 and COX-2. While COX-2 is predominantly involved in the production of prostaglandins during inflammation, COX-1 is responsible for the production of prostaglandins that help maintain the normal function of the gastrointestinal tract, including the protection of its mucosal lining. Aspirin and other NSAIDs can inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, which means that while they are effective in reducing inflammation and pain, they can also interfere with the protective functions of prostaglandins in the gastrointestinal tract. The inhibition of COX-1 results in reduced levels of prostaglandins, leading to decreased production of the protective mucus and bicarbonate layers in the stomach lining. This increases the risk of irritation and damage to the stomach lining by the acidic gastric contents, which may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. Moreover, NSAIDs can also impair blood clotting, which can contribute to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin, in particular, has an irreversible effect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation, which is necessary for the formation of blood clots at the site of injury to prevent excessive blood loss. If a person taking aspirin experiences an injury to the gastrointestinal lining, their body may have a reduced ability to clot blood, increasing the risk of bleeding. In conclusion, the hypothesis stating that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding is false.

Rescue helicopters are carrying people on a rope across the Mangfall river to ambulances waiting on the other side, four hours after the two trains crashed head-on. German news agency reported that the rail line is used by commuters going to Munich for work. Usually schoolchildren also take the trains, but they are currently on winter vacation. ___ 10:45 a.m. Federal police spokesman Stefan Brandl says the stretch of line on which the two trains crashed is squeezed between the Mangfall river on one side and a forest on the other, which is making rescue operations very difficult. He confirmed that four people had died and some 100 were injured, several seriously, but cautioned that the numbers would change. \\"The current number of dead and injured is a shapshot; this can and will still change.\\" Asked about the cause of the crash, Brandl responded, \\"We're still in the middle of the rescue operations, it's too early to talk about possible reasons for the crash now.\\" Police called a news conference for noon (1100 GMT). ___ 10:20 a.m. The operator of the two trains that crashed, Bayerische Oberlandbahn, says on its website that the trains of the so-called Meridian line both partially derailed and are wedged into each other.

Photograph: Michael Dalder/Reuters The passengers were mostly commuters travelling between Munich and Rosenheim. Because of school holidays, many children who would normally take the trains were not on board, a local newspaper said. Rescue workers from across Bavaria and from Austria attended the scene, with the injured transported by helicopter and boat from the site. Both train drivers died in the crash. There is no information so far as to why the trains were on the single-lane track travelling in opposite directions at the same time. “The accident is a huge shock for us. We’re doing everything to help the passengers, their relatives and train personnel,” Bernd Rosenbusch, the head of the Bavarian overland train service BOB, told the local news portal Mangfall24. The trains’ operator, Meridian, is part of French passenger transport firm Transdev, which is jointly owned by state-owned bank CDC and water and waste firm Veolia. State-owned Deutsche Bahn is responsible for the track. The line has a system that makes a train brake automatically if it goes through a red light. The line between Holzkirchen and Rosenheim was closed indefinitely with a replacement bus service in operation. A press conference was expected to take place at midday. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"At least nine people have been killed and around 150 others injured, with more than 50 in a serious condition, after two local trains collided head-on in southern Germany.

Article: When I was about eight years old, I decided that I wanted to be a famous film star when I grew up. Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals and pour thick flour over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios _ .

Both these parties are dominant forces in the nation's political landscape, while there are over 20 additional minor parties that also participate in the country's politics. The PRS is a significant political organization in Guinea-Bissau that has played a crucial role in shaping the government and policies since its establishment in 1992. It was founded by former President Kumba Yalá, who had served the country from 2000 to 2003. The Party for Social Renewal was formed in response to the country's long struggle for democracy, human rights, and social justice. It aimed to focus on nation-building and implementing policies to improve the quality of life for the people of Guinea-Bissau. Over the years, the PRS has been involved in coalition governments and has held significant positions within the political system. The party particularly appeals to the younger population and those who seek improvements in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and efficient governance. In summary, the other major political party in Guinea-Bissau, apart from the PAIGC, is the PRS or Party for Social Renewal. Both parties have been instrumental in shaping the course of the nation's politics and governance, with each commanding a considerable following and representing different sections of the society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On Monday, Lincoln Stars players Thomas Ryan Carey and Brandon Nicholas Smith, both 19, were charged with use of a minor in a sexual performance as well as possession and dissemination of child pornography. A 15-year-old girl from Moorhead has accused the two men of videotaping her having sex, and then sending the video to several friends.

The victim reportedly told authorities that she met Carey and Smith at a party in Moorhead, Minnesota. After engaging in a conversation with the two men, she agreed to accompany them to a nearby hotel room. Once inside the room, the victim claims that the sexual encounter took place, and she became aware that one of the players was recording it without her consent. After the incident, the 15-year-old girl discovered that the video had been shared with several people via text messages. Feeling hurt, violated, and upset, she decided to report the crime to the police. The Moorhead Police Department subsequently launched an investigation into the incident, leading to the arrest and charging of both players, Thomas Ryan Carey and Brandon Nicholas Smith. The Lincoln Stars hockey organization and the U.S. Hockey League have taken swift action regarding this case. Both Carey and Smith have been suspended indefinitely from the team, pending the outcome of their trial. The league and team are cooperating fully with the authorities, reiterating that they have zero-tolerance for such deplorable acts and have the welfare of the victim as their top priority. The shocking incident has triggered a heated debate over the conduct of young athletes, the responsibilities of sports organizations in preventing abuse, and the role of bystanders in perpetuating the harmful behavior. Parents, coaches, and communities are calling for strict measures, including stringent background checks, mandatory trainings on consent and appropriate behavior, and clear policies against any form of abuse. In the midst of this social debate, the overwhelming sympathy lies with the young victim who had her trust shattered and her dignity violated by those she thought she could trust. The case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers young people may face in seemingly innocent situations and the importance of educating them about consent, personal boundaries, and their rights. As the trial date approaches, the victim and her family are bracing for a difficult time in court. They are determined to seek justice and ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. Carey and Smith, on the other hand, will handle the legal battle with their respective attorneys, and the outcome of the trial will determine the path their careers and lives will take. Regardless of the outcome, this case highlights the critical need for ongoing dialogue surrounding consent, respect, and the responsibility each individual holds in upholding the safety and dignity of others. The sports world, in particular, must come together to rectify the culture and prevent such abhorrent actions from ever happening again."},{"prompt":"Read the below conversation. W: Good morning.

Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises. In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58 percent of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture. In 1946, Frieda Miller - then Director of United States Department of Labour - told the International Labour Organisation that these home-based operations offered, \\"low wages, long hours, child labour, unhealthy and insanitary working conditions.\\" What is the answer to this question: What time were home manufactoring activities for children taking place?","completion":"The article does not provide specific information regarding the exact time when home manufacturing activities for children took place. However, it mentions that families operated out of their homes seven days a week and year-round, which implies that children could be working alongside their parents throughout the day, and potentially during extended hours, depending on the demands of the work. The home-based operations were characterized by \\"long hours,\\" so it can be inferred that children engaged in these activities spent a significant portion of their day, possibly even beyond typical working hours, in manufacturing tasks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a news article: Media caption About 100 people were rescued from their cars on flooded roads Nine people have been killed after \\"unprecedented\\" floods swept through the US states of North and South Carolina. South Carolina schools were shut on Monday and several motorways were closed as rain continued to fall. One weather station in Columbia - South Carolina's capital - recorded 17 inches (43cm) in as many hours on Sunday. The torrential rains have been made worse by a weather system connected to Hurricane Joaquin in the Caribbean. The storm is not expected to hit the eastern US, but the moisture associated with it is contributing to heavy rainfall. \\"The flooding is unprecedented and historical,\\" said Dr Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia. Many of the victims have drowned after flood waters swept over their vehicles. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley urged residents to stay indoors. \\"The water is not safe and a lot of areas across the state where you see this deep water, it's got bacteria in it. So, stay inside and don't get in there,\\" she said.

The move means state and local authorities can receive federal help to deal with the flooding. \\"We have every ambulance in the county out responding to calls. People are being moved from their homes in boats,\\" Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach told Reuters. About 100 people were rescued from their cars on flooded roads on Saturday night. In the historic city centre of Charleston, many streets have been closed and sandbags have been piled up to keep floodwaters out. ||||| CLOSE As historic rain continues to pound South Carolina, people were forced to evacuate their homes. Boats helped rescue those who were stranded. Floodwaters rise as a vehicle and a man navigate flooded streets in Florence, S.C., on Sunday. (Photo: Gerry Broome, AP) Much of South Carolina was gripped by floodwaters early Monday, as emergency responders promised renewed door-to-door searches for anyone still trapped after days of torrential rain. At least seven weather-related deaths have been blamed on the storm, as \\"historic\\" rainfall up to 2 feet in some areas combined with high winds to strand motorists and residents and force hundreds of evacuations and rescues. As for the economic cost of the flooding, it should \\"easily surpass 1 billion given the enormity of the damage,\\" according to an early estimate from Steve Bowen, a meteorologist with Aon Benfield, a global reinsurance firm. \\"The cost to infrastructure alone could be that much, \\" Bowen said in an e-mail to USA TODAY. \\"Unfortunately, as is the case with flood events, much of the damage will not be covered by insurance since only a small percentage of homeowners in South Carolina are current National Flood Insurance Program policyholders.\\" The rain was forecast to continue deep into Monday in some parts of the state. Overnight curfews were in effect beginning at 6 p.m. Sunday in Columbia, Sumter and several counties. Gov. Nikki Haley on Sunday said South Carolina's first responders were battling flooding from rains that can be expected once in 1,000 years.

Columbia recorded more than 10 inches. President Obama approved federal disaster aid for South Carolina. Haley said first responders received more than 750 rescue calls in a 12-hour period that started before dawn Sunday. Hundreds of road closures were reported, including a section of Interstate 95, the vital highway connecting eastern states from Maine to Florida. CLOSE South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley says that parts of her state haven't had this much rain in 1,000 years. So far, three people have died from weather-related incidents in South Carolina. VPC Haley said 600 National Guard personnel have been called out, with hundreds more on alert. And she warned residents not to plan on getting out until Tuesday to ease the burden on rescue personnel. Among those rescued were a mother and her 15-month-old daughter, who were rescued from the roof of their flooded home by a Coast Guard air crew in Huger, about 25 miles north of Charleston, on Sunday. A helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Savannah, Ga., evacuated the pair to Mt. Pleasant Regional Airport. AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski called the weather event the worst in the state since Hurricane Hugo, which made landfall near Charleston as a Category 4 storm in 1989, killing 27 people in the state. \\"Charleston got 11.5 inches of rain on Saturday, which is a one-day record,\\" Pydynowski said. \\"Today Columbia is setting records.\\" In Mount Pleasant, Sarah Shinners said her home was above the waterline — but the only road out of her neighborhood was impassable. \\"Everything around us is completely flooded. It's terrible,\\" Shinners told USA TODAY. \\"We are just hunkering down.\\" Much of the East Coast has been saturated by rains that have lingered since Thursday. Power was knocked out to about 50,000 residences and businesses in South Carolina and Georgia as of Sunday afternoon. \\"Major to localized catastrophic flash flooding along with possible landslides and mudslides in the higher elevations of South Carolina and Georgia remain an ongoing concern,\\" the National Weather Service warned. Flood warnings also were issued for three Virginia counties. North Carolina also was dealing with flash flooding on some secondary roads, and some ferry services were canceled. But South Carolina was taking the brunt of the unrelenting storm. Chris Morris is one of the lucky ones in his Charleston neighborhood. He said many neighbors have evacuated, but his family's home is on a raised slab and hasn't been breached. He lives on a golf course, but you would not know that by looking at it. \\"We woke up this morning to about 10 inches of water surrounding the house,\\" Morris told USA TODAY. \\"And the golf course is completely under water.\\" The weather service blamed a low pressure system that has stalled over the state since Thursday, combined with the outer edges of Hurricane Joaquin. The Category 2 hurricane, with sustained top winds of 105 mph, avoided a direct hit to the U.S. but did add fuel to rains and high wind along the coast. Joaquin was forecast to lash Bermuda late Sunday and Monday. South Carolina emergency management officials counseled residents to \\"remain where you are if you are safely able to do so. Call 911 for life-threatening emergencies.\\" Mind-boggling rain amounts so far: 24+\\" 3NNE Boone Hall 18+\\" near Kiawah & Huger 16.61\\" CHS Airport 14.25\\" DT CHS http://t.co/Mh9bmBhfFm — NWS Charleston, SC (@NWSCharlestonSC) October 4, 2015 In Columbia, officials said many residents were without drinking water because of water main breaks. Greater downtown Columbia and southeast Richland County were most affected. City officials said those affected should be prepared to be without potable water from the city system for three to four days. The city issued a boil water advisory for all of its 375,000 customers. City fire officials said several dams had breached. WLTX-TV meteorologist Jim Gandy said the Village of Sandhill had received 11 inches of rain by 6 a.m. On I-95 in Clarendon County, a 32-mile stretch of road was closed. Parts of Interstate 77 and Interstate 20 also were covered in water. Columbia Fire Chief Aubrey Jenkins told WLTX-TV that the city has been inundated with rescue calls. \\"We do need more resources,\\" Jenkins said. \\"People who can't get out should call 9-1-1.

He wears a ring on his finger, adorned with eight stars.We are then introduced to Leon, a vegan photographer who heads into the city's subway system at night to take photographs. He is criticized constantly by other photographers for fleeing danger before shooting a full reel. One night, in a decision to break this trend, he saves a woman from a gang that is abusing her. The next day, he discovers this girl has gone missing. Leon is intrigued by the mystery, and begins to investigate newsreels about similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany, who he suspects has been killing subway passengers for as long as a hundred years.Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him, and instead cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya, who is as disbelieving of his story as the police chief. Leon takes matters into his own hands, entering the subway train at midnight, only to witness a shocking bloodbath, as the butcher kills several passengers, then hangs them on meat hooks.

Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries.[AB] The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour.

Among the sites hit was a Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital, where seven people were reportedly killed. France said such acts constituted war crimes. Activists have accused Russia of carrying out the strikes but there has been no independent confirmation. Russia has been backing the Syrian government in its offensive against rebels but says it only targets what it calls \\"terrorists\\". Two medical facilities in Maarat al-Numan, which is in Idlib province, are reported to have been hit. MSF said one of its facilities had been struck by four missiles in the space of minutes, leading them to believe it \\"wasn't an accidental attack, that it was deliberate\\". It said seven people died with another eight still missing. Mego Terzian, president of MSF France, told Reuters \\"either the [Syrian] government or Russia\\" was \\"clearly\\" responsible. But the Syrian ambassador to Moscow Riad Haddad, said the US was to blame, a claim the Pentagon dismissed as \\"patently false\\". \\"We have no reason to strike in Idlib, as Isil [Islamic State] is not active there,\\" spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said. A second hospital in Maarat al-Numan was also hit, killing three people, said opposition group the Local Co-ordination Committees. The strikes follow a pattern of systematic attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria, says the BBC's Mark Lowen in neighbouring Turkey. 240 facilities hit up to late 2015 70 in Jun-Aug 2015 alone 697 medical personnel killed 40% of Syrians lack basic care In Azaz, near the Turkish border, at least 12 people were killed in an attack on two hospitals and two schools, reports said. One of those hit was a children's hospital. A worker for Syria Charity, which runs the facility, blamed Russia. \\"The Russians have been targeting this area because it's what we call a liberated area, by moderate opposition - that's why we are 99% sure this was Russian airstrikes,\\" said Anfal Sevik. Unicef said six children were killed in the strikes on schools. \\"Let us remember that these victims are children,\\" a statement said. \\"Children.\\" Azaz has been the focus of intense fighting, with Turkey on Monday threatening Kurdish rebels with the \\"harshest reaction\\" if they tried to take the town. Despite the bombardment Kurdish-led forces have captured the town of Tal Rifaat from Islamist rebels, the monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A statement from UN spokesman spokesman Farhan Haq said the attacks \\"cast a shadow\\" on commitments made by international powers last week. At a conference, world leaders pledged to work towards a cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week. But Russia argues that the \\"cessation\\" does not apply to its air strikes, which have tilted the balance of the war in favour of the Syrian government. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said any ceasefire did not mean \\"each party will stop using weapons\\". In televised comments he questioned whether conditions for the halt in fighting could be met in a week, Reuters reported. France said it condemned the bombing of the MSF clinic in the strongest terms, with Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault saying such acts \\"constitute war crimes\\". The US has also condemned the strikes, saying they cast doubt \\"on Russia's willingness and/or ability to help bring to a stop the continued brutality of the Assad regime against its own people\\". EU foreign policy chief said the attack on the MSF facility was \\"completely unacceptable\\" but did not say who was responsible. The UN envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, is in the capital Damascus as part of his effort to restart peace talks.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Paragraph: Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. Question: \\"How does air leave our lungs?\\" Answer: \\"Exhaling\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"Exhaling\\" is correct based on the paragraph.

Answer the question: If someone has a larger than average physical heart then it will beat more or less in order to pump blood? A:","completion":"If someone has a larger than average physical heart, it will likely beat less in order to pump blood. Step 1: Understanding the fact - When the heart has the ability to expel more blood with each stroke, it can maintain the same volume of blood flow with fewer beats. Step 2: Relating the fact to the question - In the case of a larger than average physical heart, it is more likely that it can expel more blood with each stroke due to the increased volume held within its chambers.

Two-and-a-half millennia Answer:","completion":"Title: The Forgotten Millennia Genre: Fantasy, Adventure, Drama Plot Summary: In a mystical land lost in time, the One Ring, a powerful artifact with the ability to control the forces of darkness and bring its possessor unmatched power, was lost two-and-a-half millennia ago. Rumors and legends have circulated for centuries, but no one has ever managed to find and harness its power. The story begins in the kingdom of Eldarath, ruled by the wise and just Queen Lysandra. Eldarath is facing severe political turmoil, as dark powers are uniting and threatening the peace of the land. The existence of the One Ring is no longer just a legend, as its whispers grow louder in the shadowy corners of the kingdom. According to a cryptic prophecy, a chosen one will be born with the ability to find the One Ring, channel its powers, and restore balance in the world. As the prophecy foretold, a young girl named Emery is born with a mysterious mark on her wrist, resembling the shape of a ring. Her parents, simple farmers, protect her as much as they can, but the darkness that surrounds them creeps closer, threatening their humble life. Years pass, and Emery grows, discovering her unique abilities to influence the elements and control the very nature of magic in the world around her. Her parents, desperate to protect her, reveal her the truth about her destiny. In an attempt to escape the darkness, Emery sets forth on an epic journey to find the One Ring and fulfill her destiny. Along the way, she brings together an unlikely band of misfits: Arlon, a courageous but heartbroken knight exiled from his own kingdom; Thalia, a cunning and resourceful rogue with her own hidden agenda; and Sorrel, a loyal and protective beast with a mysterious connection to Emery's power. Together, they must navigate treacherous landscapes, face off with ruthless villains and terrifying creatures, and ultimately find the One Ring, long lost for two-and-a-half millennia. Unbeknownst to them, the One Ring has its own guardians, ancient spirits compelled to protect the ring at all costs. As Emery and her companions grow closer to their goal, the burden of wielding the One Ring takes a toll on her; the power it holds threatens to corrupt her, and the line between who can be trusted and who cannot grows increasingly blurry. Arlon, Thalia, and Sorrel are not immune to the temptations of the One Ring, and as the group ventures deeper into the heart of darkness, their loyalty will be tested. Ultimately, Emery must battle the shadows within herself and make a heart-wrenching choice: accept the power of the One Ring and restore balance to the world, or risk the complete destruction of everything she loves and holds dear. The Forgotten Millennia is a tale of friendship, hope, and sacrifice. A young girl destined to fulfill an age-old prophecy must confront unimaginable challenges and face the darkness within herself. Our heroes will traverse through a beautiful, dangerous world, fighting against overwhelming odds to save their loved ones and restore the land's equilibrium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Several factors can direct consumers towards more environmentally--friendly behavior. To achieve this,we need clear and simple information to guide consumption decisions. Indeed.Two thirds of consumers find it difficult to understand which products are better for the environment when shopping. With 58% of Europeans believing that many companies pretend to be green in order to charge higher prices, industry has a long way to go in helping consumers feet confident when making green choices.They should give consumers more information about the carbon footprint of their products,and promote more sustainable behavior among their customers. To be sure, companies are increasingly creating product labels that help consumers make responsible choices--for instance, reminding users of products made from materials that are recycled,renewable, and/or less carbon--intensive. Even so,only,20% of Europeans believe that companies are doing enough to promote environmentally friendly options. In times of crisis, consumers prefer high-quality products that will last long and won't go out of style.Durable products might sometimes cost more, but they don't need to be replaced as frequently.

Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender.

The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff. - The War Office was a department of the British Government responsible for the administration of the British Army between the 17th century and 1964, when its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Defence. - A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the law of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility. Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages, perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be given, and using weapons that cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. - A gallows (or scaffold) is a frame, typically wooden, used for execution by hanging, or as a means of torture before execution, as was used when being hanged, drawn and quartered. - Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck. The \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" states that hanging in this sense is \\"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\\", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain \\"hanging\\". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the official execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first account of execution by hanging was in Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". In this specialised meaning of the common word \\"hang\\", the past and past participle is \\"hanged\\" instead of \\"hung\\". - John Amery (14 March 1912 19 December 1945) was a British fascist who proposed to the Wehrmacht the formation of a British volunteer force (that subsequently became the British Free Corps) and made recruitment efforts and propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany. He was executed for treason after the war. What is the relationship between 'josef kramer' and 'torturer'? Answer:","completion":"Josef Kramer was a German Nazi war criminal who served as the Commandant of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He was known as \\"The Beast of Belsen\\" due to his cruelty and the inhumane treatment of camp inmates. As a commandant, he was directly responsible for overseeing and implementing the torture, abuse, and murder of thousands of people in the concentration camp. In this context, the relationship between 'Josef Kramer' and 'torturer' is that Kramer can be considered a torturer, given his role in inflicting physical and psychological pain on the prisoners under his command."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Emerging data support a role for antibody Fc-mediated antiviral activity in vaccine efficacy and in the control of HIV-1 replication by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Antibody-mediated virus internalization is an Fc-mediated function that may act at the portal of entry whereby effector cells may be triggered by pre-existing antibodies to prevent HIV-1 acquisition. Understanding the capacity of HIV-1 antibodies in mediating internalization of HIV-1 virions by primary monocytes is critical to understanding their full antiviral potency. Antibody isotypes/subclasses differ in functional profile, with consequences for their antiviral activity. For instance, in the RV144 vaccine trial that achieved partial efficacy, Env IgA correlated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection (i.e. decreased vaccine efficacy), whereas V1-V2 IgG3 correlated with decreased risk of HIV-1 infection (i.e. increased vaccine efficacy). Thus, understanding the different functional attributes of HIV-1 specific IgG1, IgG3 and IgA antibodies will help define the mechanisms of immune protection. Here, we utilized an in vitro flow cytometric method utilizing primary monocytes as phagocytes and infectious HIV-1 virions as targets to determine the capacity of Env IgA (IgA1, IgA2), IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies to mediate HIV-1 infectious virion internalization. Importantly, both broadly neutralizing antibodies (i.e. PG9, 2G12, CH31, VRC01 IgG) and non-broadly neutralizing antibodies (i.e. 7B2 mAb, mucosal HIV-1+ IgG) mediated internalization of HIV-1 virions. Furthermore, we found that Env IgG3 of multiple specificities (i.e. CD4bs, V1-V2 and gp41) mediated increased infectious virion internalization over Env IgG1 of the same specificity, while Env IgA mediated decreased infectious virion internalization compared to IgG1.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process is breathing in, or inhalation. This is when you take air containing oxygen into your lungs. The process of breathing can be explained in more detail as follows: 1. Inhalation: When you inhale, your diaphragm, which is a dome-shaped muscle located underneath the lungs, contracts and moves downward. This action increases the volume inside the thoracic cavity and creates a negative pressure, which causes air to be drawn into the lungs through the nostrils, mouth, pharynx, and trachea. 2. Gas exchange in the lungs: As the inhaled air reaches the bronchial tubes and the bronchioles, it ultimately arrives at the alveoli – tiny, balloon-like sacs in your lungs. The walls of the alveoli are very thin and are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, which allows for efficient gas exchange. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the alveolar walls and into the red blood cells present within the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the red blood cells into the alveoli. 3. Oxygen transportation: Oxygen-rich blood is carried back to the heart via the pulmonary veins. The blood is then pumped by the left side of the heart through the aorta and further distributed to the rest of the body via a network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. Oxygen diffuses from the bloodstream into the body's cells to support their metabolic activities. 4. Carbon dioxide transportation and exhalation: As cells consume oxygen, they produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. This waste gas diffuses back into the bloodstream, where most of it is transported in the form of bicarbonate ions. The blood then circulates back to the heart, and the right side of the heart pumps the carbon dioxide-rich blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries. In the lungs, carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, where it is then expelled from the lungs and exhaled through the trachea, pharynx, mouth, and nostrils. This entire process is crucial in maintaining the proper level of oxygen in the body to support cellular metabolism and the removal of carbon dioxide to prevent toxicity.

Matthew Radar's mother said he was always a climber, and it ultimately led him to his death. The child found a container of cinnamon powder, ate it and died from asphyxiation. \\"He was completely healthy - no problems,\\" Brianna Radar, the boy's mother, said. \\"He started choking. It was like he was having a seizure and just collapsed.\\" Matthew was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead an hour and a half later. The coroner ruled the death was accidental and said cinnamon asphyxiation is a common problem when the powder is inhaled. While Matthew was choking on the cinnamon, some of it got into his lungs and caused his death. Radar said she hopes teenagers who are participating in the social media stunt known as the \\"cinnamon challenge\\" will realize the dangers of ingesting large amounts of cinnamon as a result of her son's death, though it is an unrelated incident. In the cinnamon challenge, people record a video of themselves attempting to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon without water. Many of the videos include the participants coughing violently when they are unable to do it. \\"Cinnamon can kill,\\" Radar said. \\"All these kids, they don't think about the fact it can hurt them.\\" Radar said Matthew's organs were donated in the hopes his death will help save other lives.

Brianna Rader's son Matthew was completely healthy. But Wednesday morning, when he explored the kitchen at his Mother's apartment and found a bottle of cinnamon, Rader's worst nightmare came true. \\"He started choking, it was like he was having a seizure and just collapsed,\\" Radar said. Matthew was rushed to ER but it was too late. He died 90 minutes later. The coroner calls his death accidental, saying the cinnamon can caused asphyxiation \\"He choked on it, it got into his lungs,\\" Radar said. Dr. Elwin Crawford with Med Center Hoover says what people don't know about Cinnamon is not very biodegradable and too much of it can literally dry in your mouth. \\"Once that happens you are more prone to vomit. Once you vomit then can actually go back down into the lungs,\\" Crawford explained. And that, Crawford says, can lead to a cascade of events like pneumonia, collapse lungs, and even death. \\"Absolutely! If you go into respiratory distress, it can cause you to stop breathing, causes pneumonia, etc. So yes absolutely it can be fatal.\\" The Cinnamon Challenge is where people video tape themselves attempting to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon without any water. \\"They have no idea the dangers of this. So I would urge everyone to pass the word that it is very dangerous,\\" Crawford said. It's why Rader is coming forward, just days after her son's death. \\"To let people know cinnamon can kill. All these kids do the Cinnamon Challenge, they don't think about the fact it can hurt them.\\" Copyright 2015 WBRC.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the video that has the Tops of the Pops performance from the band that was featured on the Hype! documentary? \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

The simplest example of this is a reflex action, an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus. To test the “knee-jerk” reflex, a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer. The stimulation of the nerves there leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the knee. This is similar to the reaction of someone who touches a hot stove and instinctually pulls his or her hand away. Even humans, with our great capacity to learn, still exhibit a variety of innate behaviors.

However, challenging ourselves to be spontaneous and tackling our fears opens doors to new opportunities, growth, and richer life experiences. In this article, we will discuss the importance of embracing spontaneity, confronting your fears, trying new activities and hobbies, and taking classes to broaden your horizons and continue personal development. 1. Embrace spontaneity Spontaneity is the practice of acting on impulse and being open to new ideas and experiences without excessive forethought or worry. When we take the time to be spontaneous, we allow ourselves to break free from our mundane routines and predictable lives, making room for serendipity, freedom, and excitement. Step-by-step tips to embrace spontaneity: - Take a different route to work or during regular walks - Visit a new restaurant or type of cuisine - Attend a local event in your community - Make plans with someone you haven't seen in a while 2. Tackle your fears Fears and anxieties can often hold us back from growing and experiencing the world to its fullest. In order to overcome these fears, it is crucial to identify them, confront them head-on, and take incremental steps to defeat them. Step-by-step tips to tackle your fears: - Identify your fears and anxieties - Make a plan to gradually expose yourself to the fear-inducing situation or activity - Seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional - Practice self-compassion and understand that progress may take time 3. Try new activities Engaging in new activities and hobbies not only adds variety and excitement to your life but also helps you gain new skills, meet new people, and discover untapped passions. Step-by-step tips to try new activities: - Research local groups, clubs, or classes in your community - Ask friends or acquaintances for recommendations - Commit to trying at least one new activity per month - Reflect on your experiences and assess whether you enjoyed it, found it challenging, or would like to continue pursuing the activity 4. Take a class Taking a class or workshop in something completely new or out of your comfort zone is a powerful way to challenge yourself, learn, and grow as an individual. Whether it is dance, cooking, language, or art, enrolling in a class can provide you with new skills, social connections, and a sense of accomplishment. Step-by-step tips to take a class: - Explore local community colleges, art centers, or online platforms that offer courses - Choose a topic or subject that genuinely interests you or pushes you out of your comfort zone - Commit to attending each session and participating actively - Reflect on the experience and decide if the class has inspired further interest or personal growth Conclusion Embracing spontaneity, tackling your fears, trying new activities, and enrolling in classes can lead you to a more fulfilling, exciting, and well-rounded life. It is through constant challenges and stepping out of our comfort zones that we truly learn and grow as individuals.

So far this year, a man in Kerala was gored by an irate elephant while posing for a selfie at a temple in April, and a teenager in Chennai was killed by a train after posing near railway tracks. Indians have also been killed falling out of boats, off cliffs and into canals in recent months. Mumbai has set up 16 “no selfie zones” at popular but dangerous locations after a tragic accident claimed two lives in January. India overtook the US this year to become the world’s second-largest smartphone market, with 220 million users, behind only China. India’s gun laws allow citizens to buy firearms with a government-issued licence, although the process is expensive and difficult. There are six million registered guns in India, and up to an estimated 40 million illegal firearms. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A boy in India accidentally hurt himself really badly when he tried to take a picture of himself, called a selfie, using his dad's gun.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce...

Here is a news article: Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, ride in the Adairville Strawberry Festival parade while campaigning for the Republican primary in Adairville, Ky. Getty Images Tuesday brings the biggest primary day of the season. Republicans will pick Senate candidates in Georgia, Kentucky and Oregon. Pennsylvania Democrats will choose their candidate to face Gov. Tom Corbett. And there are an array of open House races in Georgia. (Related: Election Drama in House Primaries Tuesday) Here’s Washington Wire’s look at five top races to watch Tuesday: Kentucky GOP Senate primary Polls open (ET): 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Eastern Time Zone, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the Central Time Zone Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is going to win big over challenger Matt Bevin, but there may be clues in Tuesday’s results that tell us something about Mr. McConnell’s general election battle with Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. As our Dante Chinni points out, if Mr. McConnell puts up big margins in evangelical areas in the primary, it bodes well for him in the general election, when Ms. Grimes may do better in Kentucky’s population centers than did Mr. McConnell’s underfunded 2008 challenger, Bruce Lunsford. For Mr. Bevin, Tuesday ends what has been a disappointing effort to oust Mr. McConnell from the right. He poured 900,000 of his own money into the campaign but never gained traction. From making rookie mistakes like allowing himself to debate a McConnell aide to having backed the Troubled Asset Relief Program he attacked Mr. McConnell for supporting to speaking at a pro-cockfighting rally and then having to apologize for it, it has been a parade of errors for Mr. Bevin. Meanwhile, Mr. McConnell has had support from the broad Republican establishment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association have spent money on his behalf, while Mr. McConnell’s chief antagonists, the Senate Conservatives Fund, has backed Mr. Bevin. Mr. Bevin’s race marks the beginning of what is setting up to be a string of defeats for Republican challengers to incumbent senators. Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel trails Sen. Thad Cochran and over the weekend was forced to explain why a supporter videotaped Mr. Cochran’s ailing wife at her nursing home. In Kansas, physician Milton Wolf hasn’t gained traction against Sen. Pat Roberts after admitting that he wrote Facebook comments about patients he treated. Georgia GOP Senate Primary Polls open (ET): 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. This is a three-way race to finish second. Former Reebok and Dollar General CEO David Perdue, Rep. Jack Kingston and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel are atop a five-way field to replace Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Since state law requires a July run-off election if no candidate reaches 50% in the primary – a certainty in a five-way race – the drama here is who will finish second, Mr. Kingston or Ms. Handel. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is advertising in heavy rotation to back Mr. Kingston, while Ms. Handel has support from Sarah Palin and Rick Santorum. Democrats had hoped – and Republican establishment types feared – that one of the two tea-party physicians in the race, Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey, would advance out of the primary, but odds of that now appear slim. Whichever Republican survives will face Democrat Michelle Nunn in November. If Ms. Handel qualifies for the run-off, the contours of the run-off will be clear: She will assume most tea party support while Mr. Kingston, a 22-year House veteran, or Mr. Perdue, whose cousin Sonny Perdue was governor, would be the establishment’s choice. In past years the establishment has lost those intraparty battles. This year the tables have turned. Oregon GOP Senate Primary Polls open (ET): 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monica Wehby is the longshot hope for Senate Republicans in 2014. A pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. Wehby raised an impressive amount of money for a first-time candidate, released a set of sharp TV ads and has positioned herself as a moderate in a blue state. Now she only needs to defeat a more conservative primary opponent, state Rep. Jason Conger. And then came the allegations she stalked an ex-boyfriend, who happens to now be a prominent campaign supporter. The stalking allegations may have more impact on Dr. Wehby’s general election chances than during the primary – most Oregonians vote by mail – but she has not handled the questions with much deft, fleeing a Friday debate “as reporters tried without success to interview her,” Portland’s Oregonian wrote. Mr. Conger is to the right of Dr. Wehby on a host of social issues important to Republicans (gay marriage and abortion rights in particular). But with Dr. Wehby holding double-digit leads in pre-primary polling, the last-minute hit may not be damaging enough to her Tuesday. But the next five months may tell a different story. Idaho GOP 2nd Congressional District primary Polls open (ET): 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Rep. Mike Simpson is one of House Speaker John Boehner’s key allies and a top target for the Club for Growth. But after 500,000 in advertising tying Mr. Simpson to the TARP bailout and other conservative apostasies failing to close the gap, the Club for Growth bailed on the race. It hasn’t advertised in Idaho in the campaign’s final weeks, when it shifted its resources to Nebraska’s Senate primary. Attorney Bryan Smith was left to fend for himself, while Mr. Simpson had an array of mainstream Republican defenders at the ready: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Defending Main Street super PAC, the National Rifle Association, the National Association of Realtors and the American Dental Association all spent on Mr. Simpson’s behalf. Mitt Romney, who won 65% of Idaho’s 2012 vote, filmed an ad backing Mr. Simpson. In the end it was too much for Mr. Smith, who has local tea party support but little other help on the TV airwaves. Mr. Simpson is expected to cruise to re-election in November. (Related: Election Drama in House Primaries Tuesday) Pennsylvania Governor Polls open (ET): 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. After spending 10 million on his race, Tom Wolf carries a wide lead over the three other Democrats fighting for the right to face Republican Gov. Tom Corbett in November. There are few policy differences between Mr. Wolf, whose family owns a cabinetry company, Rep. Allyson Schwartz, who represents a Philadelphia-area district, former Clinton administration adviser Katie McGinty, or state Treasurer Rob McCord. Ms. Schwartz, in a rare tactic for Democrats this cycle, has gone out of her way to highlight her support for Obamacare. That’s key in a state where Mr. Corbett declined to accept the Medicaid expansion and is seen as one of the nation’s most vulnerable incumbent governors. But it is likely not enough to overcome months of Mr. Wolf’s television advertising. Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.

The Democrats’ best hopes for Senate pick-ups are in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell faces a tea party-inspired primary challenge, and Georgia, where a crowded field of Republican candidates will be narrowed to a two-way runoff. Text Size - + reset John Harris analysis Primary preview: Kentucky, Georgia Chamber eyes Ky., Ga. Senate races Polls finish closing in Kentucky and Georgia at 7 p.m., in Pennsylvania at 8 p.m., in Arkansas at 8:30 p.m. and in Idaho and Oregon at 11 p.m. Here are five themes to watch for as returns come in: (Full results: 2014 primary elections) In Georgia, will the two most establishment-friendly candidates make it to a runoff? David Perdue, a former Dollar General CEO, has led in the final polls of the race to succeed retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss, and he’s taken the brunt of attacks in recent days. His No. 1 antagonist has been Rep. Jack Kingston, who is backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Both men are battling for a similar base of support as they seek to make the July 22 runoff, and a head-to-head matchup would most likely be very negative. Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, has tried to present herself as the more conservative alternative to Perdue and Kingston. She’s come under fire from two well-known social conservatives in the House, Phil Gingrey and Paul Broun, who have tried to stay in the hunt. Democratic star recruit Michelle Nunn faces no real opposition in her primary. (Also on POLITICO: GOP war revived in Georgia) Because the open Senate seat drew three House members, there are competitive GOP primaries for their seats, each of which could also go to a runoff. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Atlanta-area Rep. Hank Johnson is facing a stiff challenge from a former DeKalb county sheriff. In Oregon, how damaging is the Monica Wehby police report? For months, Republicans have touted Portland neurosurgeon Monica Wehby as a dream recruit to take on freshman Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who they think could be vulnerable because of his support for Obamacare in a state where implementation has been particularly disastrous. Wehby faces primary opposition from the more conservative state Rep. Jason Conger but has been backed by national Republican figures such as Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. Recent polls showed her well ahead. (Also on POLITICO: Second harassment accusation for Wehby) Then on Friday, POLITICO reported that Wehby’s ex-boyfriend last year accused her of “stalking” him, entering his home without his permission and “harassing” his employees. Both Wehby and her ex downplayed the incident, saying they are now on good terms. On Monday, Wehby received another blow when The Oregonian reported that her ex-husband accused her through their 2007 divorce of “ongoing harassment.” Wehby is likely to prevail because Oregon is an all-mail voting state, meaning that many of the ballots were already sent in before the news broke. (WATCH: Some of 2014's wackiest campaign ads) Oregon Republicans also are choosing a nominee to take on potentially vulnerable Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber.

There’s lots of money behind all that messaging. Just how much cash have Senate hopefuls in Georgia, Arkansas and Kentucky shelled out? (Pamela Kirkland/The Washington Post) Get excited, because voters are casting ballots in six states holding high-stakes primaries. It's the busiest primary day of the year so far -- and the most consequential. From tea party vs. establishment infighting in the West to a Democratic sprint to the left in the Northeast, there's a lot going on. But fear not! Here's where we come in. Below we give you the eight most important things to watch: 1. Who will make the Republican runoff for U.S. Senate in Georgia? From left, Reps. Paul Broun and P.J. Gingrey, minister Derrick Grayson, Rep. Jack Kingston, Arthur Gardner, Karen Handel, and David Perdue stand at their podiums to deliver opening remarks during the Georgia Republican Party U.S. Senate debate. (AP Photo/The Augusta Chronicle, Sara Caldwell) In the wildly unpredictable and increasingly nasty Georgia Senate race, there's only been one certainty the past few months: There will be a GOP runoff on July 22. Businessman David Perdue looks like a good bet to make the runoff, as his outsider message is hitting home thanks to the heaps of cash he has spent on advertising. Chamber of Commerce-backed Rep. Jack Kingston and Sarah Palin-backed former secretary of state Karen Handel are competing for a second spot, recent polls show. (A lot of undecided votes are still up for grabs.) The good news for Republican chances is that Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey, far right candidates with a knack for stoking controversy, appear to be out of the running. The winner is likely to take on highly touted Democratic recruit Michelle Nunn, a first-time candidate. Polls close at 7 p.m. Eastern. 2. What will Mitch McConnell's margin of victory be? Kentucky Republican senatorial candidate Matt Bevin holds newborn Mary Halston Brandon at the Fountain Run BBQ Festival while campaigning for the Republican primary May 17, 2014, in Fountain Run, Kentucky. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) The only question about the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Kentucky is the margin of minority leader Mitch McConnell's victory. Recent polls show him up by between 20 and 30 points. When Louisville businessman Matt Bevin launched his bid to unseat the Senate's top Republican, we thought McConnell might be in for an epic primary. McConnell is not popular and Bevin's personal fortune made him a candidate to watch. But the race has been anything but epic as the combination of missteps from the Bevin camp (um, cockfighting?) and a barrage of spending from McConnell and his allies prevented Bevin from ever posing a serious threat. That doesn't mean the final tally won't matter. As veteran observer Al Cross writes, Bevin could top 40 percent. McConnell will need every vote he can get in the fall against Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D). If more than 40 percent of the GOP primary electorate is against him now, who's to say how many of them will come out for McConnell in November? Plus, there's the symbolic element. McConnell wants to be in a position of strength Wednesday on day one of the general election. Polls close at 6 p.m. Eastern and Central. 3. Will Democrat Tom Wolf advance to a showdown against the nation's most vulnerable governor? Tom Wolf (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) Polls show businessman Tom Wolf with a wide lead over the competition in the Democratic primary for governor in Pennsylvania. Thanks to his heavy ad spending, the technocrat Wolf has jumped to the top of the heap in a race that once looked potentially ripe for Rep. Allyson Schwartz to seize. But Schwartz's former ties to centrist groups and have gotten her into some trouble, as has the crowded field. She has been touting her support for Obamacare down the stretch, an approach that has stood out in an election cycle where the law has been politically toxic in so many other aces. Like Georgia, undecided voters could decide this one. But for Wolf to be upset, undecideds would have to break heavily toward one of his opponents. That doesn't seem likely to happen. Polls close at 8 p.m. Eastern. 4. It's business versus tea party in Idaho. Business is poised for victory. Challenger Bryan Smith, left, and incumbent Rep. Mike Simpson (R) participate in a televised debate for the upcoming Republican primary in Boise, Idaho May 11. (REUTERS/Patrick Sweeney) The anti-tax Club for Growth's first ever crowdsourced candidate is attorney Bryan Smith, who is challenging Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). But the business-backed Smith has gotten far more help from third-party groups overall. His backers -- most notably the Chamber -- have spent some 2.4 million on his behalf, compared to Smith's allies spending just 600,000. The Club has been off the air since last month, a sign this race isn't very competitive. If Simpson wins, it's another victory for the business wing of the tea party, which has shown a willingness to spend big in primaries this cycle. It would also be a let down for the Club, given how much excitement it generated about Smith. Polls close at 10 p.m. Eastern. 5. Will Monica Wehby hold on in Oregon after a story about \\"stalking\\" her ex-boyfriend last year? In this March 19, 2014 photo, Oregon Republican Senate candidate Monica Wehby, right, talks to supporter Marvin Hausman in Lake Oswego, Ore. (AP Photo/Jonathan J. Cooper) Last Thursday, pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby seemed poised for victory in Oregon's GOP primary for U.S. Senate, despite a late barrage of outside spending from antiabortion groups hitting her from the right. But then came a Politico story Friday about a 2013 police report in which Wehby was accused by her ex-boyfriend of \\"stalking\\" him and entering his home without permission. Audio of the 911 call has also become public. Wehby was never arrested, but the distracting story threatens to veer her off-message for a while as the media continues to ask about it. Oregon votes by mail, and many primary ballots were cast in advance of Friday, suggesting Wehby will probably survive the primary and advance to a showdown against Sen. Jeff Merkley (D). Still, this is not the entry she envisioned. Polls close at 11 p.m. Eastern. 6. Will a Clinton-backed U.S. House candidate advance in Pennsylvania? In this Jan. 5, 1993 file photo, then-House Speaker Thomas Foley administers the House oath, during a re-enactment, to Rep Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky D-Pa. She is accompanied by husband Edward, left, and family, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Dennis Cook) Democrat Marjorie Margolies (then Margolies-Mezvinsky) lost her seat in Congress in the 1994 midterms in large part because of her vote for President Bill Clinton's economic plan. Twenty years later, she's back for a run at the House in a contested Democratic primary in Schwartz's district. Margolies has gotten fundraising help from Bill and Hillary Clinton. The former president even cut an ad for her. Margolies is the mother-in-law of Chelsea Clinton. Polls close at 8 p.m. Eastern. 7. There are two GOP primaries for U.S. House in Arkansas worth following. Republican Rep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), above, is vacating his 4th district seat to run for U.S. Senate. (AP Photo/Danny Johnston) Democrats are bullish about competing in the open 2nd and 4th congressional districts, where they've recruited capable candidates and the Republican fields are less settled. The 2nd district is Democrats' better bet. The GOP nominee there -- probably either state Rep. Ann Clemmer or banker French Hill -- will face former North Little Rock Mayor Patrick Henry Hays (D) in the fall. In the 4th district, where incumbent Rep. Tom Cotton (R) is leaving his seat to run for the U.S. Senate, the Republican frontrunner is state House Majority Leader Bruce Westerman. The GOP nominee will face former FEMA chief James Lee Witt (D). Polls close at 8:30 p.m. Eastern. 8. Which Republican will take on the last white Democrat from the Deep South in the House? Rep. John Barrow (D-Ga.) in 2012. (John Bazemore/Associated Press) Five Republicans are vying for a chance to take on Rep. John Barrow of Georgia, the last white Democrat from the Deep South in the U.S. House. Barrow survived against the odds last election cycle and his reward is that once again Republicans are eagerly eyeing a chance to unseat him. But first, they have to sort out who their nominee will be. The race may be headed to a July runoff, which would be good news for Barrow. The GOP frontrunner is construction company Rick Allen, who lost in the 2012 primary. Polls close at 7 p.m. Eastern.

However, rumors have spread about a secret government operation occurring at the rarely used train junction known as Siding Junction. Intrigued by these whispers, a group of five friends from different backgrounds - a journalist, a computer hacker, an amateur detective, an ex-convict, and a former railway employee - decide to join forces and uncover the truth about the mysterious events occurring at the junction. The group begins to investigate, piecing together information from the local townspeople and online sources. They discover that Siding Junction had been selected by a top-secret government agency as a crucial hub for transporting classified materials from one secure location to another. As the friends dig deeper into the operation, they notice that not only are cargo trains coming and going at abnormal hours, but these cargo trains are heavily guarded by masked security personnel. As they continue their investigation, they realize that what's being hidden inside these trains is far more significant than they initially thought. They stumble upon a secret cargo that holds a powerful, highly-advanced technology with the potential to create government surveillance on an unprecedented scale. Determined to expose this operation, they come up with a carefully planned mission to hijack one of the trains passing through the junction. However, the friends face various challenges along the way, including evading police, confronting the mysterious security forces guarding the trains, and overcoming internal moral dilemmas about the consequences of their actions. During their mission, the group discovers they also have to navigate the betrayal of a close ally. As the plot unfolds, they learn that the ex-convict, once jailed for being a whistleblower, was forced by the agency to infiltrate the group and deceive his newfound friends. Tensions rise as the friends struggle to trust each other and carry on with their dangerous plan. When the crucial day finally arrives, the five friends succeed in hijacking the train and exposing the government operation. The weight of their discovery is felt not only in their small town of Crestfield but on an international level as well. Facing immense pressure from the public, the government is forced to abandon its surveillance plans and disband the agency responsible for the secret operation. The friends' journey to unveil the truth creates a powerful bond between them, and as they return to their ordinary lives, they find solace in knowing that their courage and perseverance have made a lasting impact on their world.

Help as much as you can. A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: \\"I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the...

In a victory of green business that is certain to appeal to environmentally-aware music-lovers, a design student is to receive financial support to produce eco-friendly tens made of cardboard that can be recycled after the bands and the crowds have gone home. Major festivals such as Glastonburythrow away some 10,000 abandoned tents at the end of events each year. For his final year project at the University of the West of England, James Dunlop came up with a material that can be recycled. And to cope with the British summer, the cardboard has been made waterproof. Taking inspiration from a Japanese architect, who has used cardboard to make big buildings including churches, Mr. Dunlop used cardboard material for his tents, which he called Myhabs. The design won an award at the annual New Designers Exhibition after Mr. Dunlop Graduated from his product design degree and he decided to try to turn it into a business. To raise money for the idea, he toured the City's private companies which fund new businesses and found a supporter in the finance group Mint. He introduced his idea to four of Mint's directors and won their support. Mint has committed around PS500,000 to MyHab and taken a share of 30 per cent in Mr. Dunlop's business. The first Myhabs should be tested at festivals this summer, before being marketed fully next year. Mr. Dunlop said that the design, which accommodates two people, could have other uses, such as for disaster relief and housing for the London Olympics. For music events, the cardboard houses will be ordered online and put up at the sites by the Myhab team before the festival-goers arrive and removed by the company afterwards, They can be Personalized and the company will offer reductions on the expense if people agree to sell exterior advertising space.

Bob preferred to use pills rather than therapy to treat his tendinitis because it hard to do the OPTIONS: A. pills .; B. therapy .;","completion":"B. therapy. Bob had been dealing with tendinitis for quite some time now. The symptoms emerged almost six months ago, starting with a mild discomfort in his wrist that gradually escalated to severe pain. It had become an obstacle he couldn't overcome in his everyday life, affecting his relationships and even his job performance. He consulted with several doctors, each recommending various therapies as potential solutions for his chronic pain. They presented him with options like physical therapy, occupational therapy, and even chiropractic care. However, Bob couldn't commit to such treatments — they required frequent visits, a considerable amount of time and energy, and a level of engagement that he just couldn't manage in his already chaotic life. It wasn't just the logistics that made Bob wary of therapy. The mental aspect also played a significant role. He had always been an introverted person, unable to express his feelings and thoughts easily, even to a professional therapist. The thought of opening up to someone about his pain and stress was too overwhelming a task. He feared the judgment, the vulnerability, and the emotional weight that came with it. Moreover, his schedule was another factor that contributed to his reluctance to opt for therapy. Being a software engineer, Bob had to work long, irregular hours, which made it difficult for him to attend appointments. And that was not all; his workplace culture expected him to be strong and resilient in the face of adversity, including pushing through physical pain. Taking time off work for therapy was not an ideal solution in an industry that prized efficiency and productivity above all else. And so, Bob turned to an alternative treatment method that seemed more manageable – pills. Oral medication was a seemingly more straightforward solution to his problem. They offered relief without the added pressure of regular visits, sharing personal thoughts, or disrupting his life further. The various over-the-counter pills and prescription medications seemed like a godsend at first, providing temporary relief to his persistent pain. He could maintain the facade of strength and productivity that was expected of him by his employer and peers. It allowed him to continue his fast-paced life without feeling as if he was losing control. However, over time, the effectiveness of these pills diminished, and Bob found himself relying on them excessively to manage his pain. Despite this, he was adamant that they were the only viable solution for his predicament. He became fearful of the thought of life without these pills, even as his tendinitis continued to worsen. As the months went by, Bob's dependence on the pills escalated, affecting both his mental and physical wellbeing. It started to take a toll on his relationships with others, who urged him to consider alternative treatments that could provide long-lasting relief and address the root cause of his issue. Through all this, the lingering question that haunted Bob was whether he chose the right course of action. Was the temporary relief the pills provided worth the paralyzing fear of losing them? Could he have mustered the courage to overcome his discomfort with therapy and embark on the road to a more permanent solution? Bob struggled with these thoughts, unsure if he had chosen the best path to address his tendinitis. But the reality was that each person's journey was different, and Bob needed to make the decision that best aligned with his strengths, priorities, and individual circumstances. He could only hope that, in time, he would be able to find the right balance between seeking medical treatment and maintaining the other important aspects of his life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve this problem.","completion":"Okay, little buddy. Let's solve the problem step by step. Step 1: We need to subtract the numbers first. The equation is 19168 - 51196. Let me do the math: 19168 -51196 -------- -32028 Step 2: Now the equation is -32028 = 1884 * y. We need to find the value of 'y'. To do that, we'll have to divide both sides of the equation by 1884. So it will look like this: -32028 ÷ 1884 = y Let's solve it: -32028 ÷ 1884 = -17 Step 3: Now we have the answer. The value of 'y' is -17. So, y = -17. Good job!

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation -12*w - 2*w = -70 for w, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms The left side of the equation has two terms that both contain the variable w. Combine these terms by adding them together: -12*w + (-2*w) = (-12 - 2)*w = -14*w Now, the equation becomes: -14*w = -70 Step 2: Isolate the variable (w) To solve for w, you'll need to get w alone on one side of the equation. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the w term, which is -14: (-14*w) / (-14) = -70 / (-14) This simplifies to: w = 5 The value of w that satisfies the given equation is 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The health secretary said it shows a \\"better service with a better outcome for patients\\". It follows controversial changes in the way 999 calls are prioritised. But like other UK colleagues, Welsh ambulance crews are facing worsening delays in handing over patients when they get to hospital. The statistics from the BBC's freedom of information request revealed that average response times for calls, where a life is judged to be immediately at risk, have improved since a new \\"clinical model\\" came into force in October last year. In contrast, the trend in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland appears to be in the opposite direction. The changes in Wales saw response-time targets scrapped for all except the most serious cases. Before then, an eight minute target applied to about 40% of calls received by the Welsh Ambulance Service. Now the eight minute target applies to just 4 to 5% of the calls received designated red under the new system. Opposition parties at the time criticised the change as \\"moving the goal-posts\\" and the Conservatives believe the current categorisation is still too narrow for the most urgent cases. But Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said: \\"It's meant we're going after people where that fast response makes a difference. \\"And that was the whole point for the change - it's not because it's easier for a politician to do but because there's evidence and advice from leading clinicians that this is the right thing to do for patients.\\" The latest performance figures, out on Wednesday, show 77.1% of responses to red calls arrived within eight minutes. The target is 65%. BUT HANDOVER DELAYS ARE INCREASING Despite improvements in response times, the figures showed that ambulance crews face worsening delays outside A&E departments. These are caused when emergency units become full, meaning patients have to wait in an ambulance for beds to become available. When this happens the ambulance and crew cannot respond to other calls. The figures for 2016 are worse for every month compared to the same month last year - despite commitments by health boards to try to tackle the problem. The worst period was in March at the peak of the winter pressures. In total, ambulances have spent more than 40,500 unnecessary hours waiting outside A&E between January and August - nearly as much as for the whole of 2015 already. Sonia Thompson, head of operations for the Welsh Ambulance Service in north Wales, said it was a complicated issue and they were working closely with hospitals and health boards to tackle handover issues. \\"We need to understand demand and ensure if someone doesn't need to go to hospital there are alternatives to use,\\" she added. Since the new system came into force there has been a significant reduction in Wales in the length of longest waits for an ambulance response and the proportion of the most critical calls taking longer than 12 minutes. Even in the busiest month this year - March - the proportion of red calls taking more than 12 minutes was 16.6%, down from 19% for the same month in 2015. A day in the life of the ambulance service Ambulances in the UK - five ways services are innovating FATHER AND SON ON THE FRONTLINE Osian Roberts is a paramedic with 25 years experience and a team leader at the Welsh Ambulance Service, working out of Llandudno Junction, Conwy county. Driving the ambulance is his son Aron, an emergency medical technician. We spent the day with them - a 12 hour shift, which involved in two cases waits of 20 minutes outside Glan Clwyd waiting to transfer patients. Aron Roberts said: \\"The hospitals are starting to fill up slowly now and we're starting to wait a bit longer outside. It's quite frustrating when you have a poorly patient on board and they need hospital treatment - it's difficult just to wait outside and wait for a bed to become available.\\" The day before, their ambulance was waiting outside the hospital for up to four hours before patients could be taken in. The other day I went to a lady with swollen knees - she didn't think of seeing a doctor but thought an ambulance would be appropriate \\"We can take patients to get scans and X-Rays but it's not our role to do that, it should be the hospital's,\\" he said. \\"We're sat here thinking someone needs our help and can't do anything, we want to go but we just can't. When I first started I thought I'd be going to road accidents and cardiac arrests but I'm seeing more of the older generation.\\" Osian Roberts said the job had changed a great deal. \\"When I started more than 25 years ago, it was life or limb emergencies. Now we're going to more calls for chronic illnesses, the work is so much more diverse now,\\" he said. But he said there were still too many calls coming in when using a GP or pharmacist might be a better alternative. \\"The public need to be educated to choose well before they call the ambulance. Think wisely before you call - there are other options - unless it's a real emergency of course, then call 999,\\" he added. \\"It's possibly the non-emergency calls which tie us up the most. We still have to turn up, we don't just leave them there, it might be making a call to their GP or getting referred to a specialised unit. It still takes time and takes resources away from the proper emergencies.\\" Aron Roberts added: \\"The other day I went to a lady with swollen knees - she didn't think of seeing a doctor but thought an ambulance would be appropriate. We're supposed to be for life and death emergencies. \\"But since the transition, I've noticed the red calls are genuine red calls - and those who don't need so much of a fast response, we are still getting to them and they are getting the help they need but it's the right resource at the right time for that patient.\\" But the Conservatives claimed some patients with potentially serious problems - such as chest pains - might not be getting a quick enough response because the red category was now too narrow. Clwyd West AM Darren Millar said a constituent in Llandudno had to wait 35 minutes for an ambulance after collapsing with a suspected heart attack but he found it was not classified as critical because the patient was not unconscious. Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said: \\"The real scandal here is that the Welsh Government only time-targets 4% of ambulance calls, which betrays an incredible lack of accountability, particularly where conditions such as heart attack and stroke depend on the speed of treatment.\\" Dr Brendan Lloyd, the Welsh Ambulance Service medical director, said: \\"Calls in our amber category are those where the patient requires a blue light response and urgent specialist medical attention - this includes chest pain and stroke. \\"For some conditions, like stroke, there is strong evidence to support a specialist treatment within a few hours of the onset of symptoms, rather than minutes.\\" Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government \\"could not hide\\" behind the statistics which were only recently set and were not comparable as all nations measure urgent calls in different ways. The party's heath spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth AM said paramedics had told him of the stresses of dealing with the 96% of other calls. He added: \\"Figures for how many hours ambulances have to wait outside hospitals before patients can be admitted to A&E are alarming. \\"The figures published today for 2016 only go up to August and already they're nearly as high as for the whole of 2015.\\" Stephen Harrhy, chief ambulance services commissioner for NHS Wales, is responsible for reviewing performance. \\"Not only have we seen significant improvement but we've seen that achieved gradually over a period of time,\\" he said. \\"It has been sustained and that's really important because patients with immediate life-threatening conditions need to get an ambulance as quickly as they can.\\" He said the service was working with hospitals to tackle \\"complicated\\" handover problems. This included a more coordinated winter pressures plan and introducing an immediate vehicle release policy, so ambulances waiting outside hospitals could be back on the road when the service was short of vehicles. What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the improvement of ambulance response times in Wales despite ongoing delays at hospitals. Thanks to a new clinical model launched in October 2015, statistics reveal that average response times for life-threatening emergency calls have improved, while English, Scottish, and Northern Irish emergency services face worsening response times. The new system in Wales designates response-time targets only for the most serious cases, while previously, an eight-minute response target was applied to about 40% of calls. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething stated that this change helps medical professionals respond faster to the most critical cases. However, delays in handing over patients to hospitals have increased due to emergency units becoming full. Ambulances are forced to wait outside hospitals for beds to become available, preventing them from responding to other calls. Despite commitments from health boards to address the issue, the situation has not improved, with waits outside A&E in 2016 worse than the previous year, totaling over 40,500 unnecessary hours between January and August. The Welsh Ambulance Service has been working with hospitals and health boards to tackle handover issues. Efforts include understanding patient demand, providing alternative pathways for patients who do not require hospital treatment, and promoting the use of GPs and pharmacists for non-life-threatening situations. While there has been a significant reduction in ambulance wait times and critical call response times taking over 12 minutes in Wales since the new system was implemented, more work needs to be done, particularly in addressing handover problems at hospitals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That evening, teenagers Tony and Marcy make out on a nearby beach. Fuad attacks them, subduing Tony and slicing off the top of Marcy's head. He removes her brain to serve as the latest ingredient. Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief. After failing to obtain any useful information from the distraught Tony, they interrogate Marcy's mother, who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club. Staking out a local motel, Fuad sees a drunken sailor drop his wife off at her room. Fuad knocks on the woman's door and attacks her when she opens it.

Background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate.

As Detective Sophia Martinez investigates the murders with her partner, Akash, they begin to unravel a plot that not only implicates Tariq but also a powerful pharmaceutical company with a dark and menacing motive. Plot: The movie begins with a dramatic opening scene where the suspect, Tariq Husseini, is taken into custody after his fingerprint is found at the scene of the latest murder — a renowned medical researcher who was brutally murdered in her own laboratory. Detective Sophia Martinez and her Indian-American partner, Akash Rajan, are assigned to the case. As they delve into Tariq's personal and professional life, they discover that he was a well-regarded geneticist and professor at MIT. Tariq had been researching a breakthrough gene-editing treatment, CRISPR-I, that could revolutionize medicine by allowing genetic diseases to be cured. As the investigation unfolds, Sophia and Akash realize that several people close to Tariq and who worked on his CRISPR-I project are victims of similarly gruesome murders. Upon further investigation, they learn about a powerful pharmaceutical company, Vysanus Corp, which had invested heavily in Tariq's research and had exclusive rights over its commercialization. Having learned about the potential motive, Sophia and Akash go undercover and infiltrate Vysanus Corp to find more clues that could establish a connection between the company and the murders. During their investigation, they discover that Tariq had private misgivings about releasing the gene-editing technology; he had concerns that it could be misused to create unstoppable biological weapons or be used to create designer babies by those who could afford it. Sophia and Akash dig deeper, uncovering a sinister plot by Vysanus's ruthless CEO, Julian Landon: Julian had orchestrated the murders to frame and silence Tariq and his team so that Vysanus could gain control of CRISPR-I and use it solely for their financial gain. Julian also planned to silence anyone else who got close to the truth, including Sophia and Akash. The climax of the film occurs during a high-stakes gala event at Vysanus Corp, where Julian plans to unveil CRISPR-I to the world. Armed with enough evidence to indict Julian and bring his nefarious plans to light, Sophia and Akash confront him, leading to a tense standoff. In a fierce physical and moral battle, Sophia and Akash manage to subdue Julian and have him arrested. With the truth exposed and Vysanus Corp's horrific corporate intentions brought to light, Tariq Husseini's name is cleared, and he is released from custody. The film ends with Tariq vowing to ensure that any form of genetic editing technology will only be used for the betterment of humanity. Shattered Mirage is a gripping thriller that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. It delves into the ethical complexities of genetic advancements while ensuring that justice ultimately prevails."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This is due to an increase in nuclear charge. Alkali metals have the lowest electronegativities, while halogens have the highest. Because most noble gases do not form compounds, they do not have electronegativities. Note that there is little variation among the transition metals. Electronegativities generally decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the larger atomic size. John was studying the periodic table. To make things easier for him he divided the table in different sections, section A, section B, section C, and section D. Section A elements are located at the left of the table, but section B elements are located at the right side of the table. Section C elements are located at the top, but section D elements are located at the bottom. Which section would have weaker nulcear charge, section A or section B?

Two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff, but did not affect the campaign. One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust. Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage, but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates. The second issue centered on Eisenhower's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance. Just two weeks prior to the election, Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there. He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO; finally, he stressed a corruption-free, frugal administration at home.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. I am facing a new situation today: John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sample would less likely be used as fuel, sample C or sample D? The answer is:","completion":"Sample C would less likely be used as fuel. This is because Sample C is composed of uranium-238 (U-238), which is not fissionable and cannot undergo the necessary nuclear reactions to produce energy in a nuclear reactor. On the other hand, Sample D consists of uranium-235 (U-235), which is fissionable and can be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor when enriched to at least 3% concentration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Isolate the variable j To isolate j, we need to move the constant 7 to the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 7 = 7*j + 7 - 7 -7 = 7*j Step 4: Solve for j Now we need to solve for j.

Step 2: Apply shaving cream onto the same area after shaving. Option 2: put it on whatever part of your body you're shaving before you shave. Step 1: Apply shaving cream onto the desired area of the body before shaving. Step 2: Shave over the area with the shaving cream applied. Justification: The purpose of shaving cream is to create a protective barrier between the skin and the razor, as well as facilitate a smooth shaving process by lubricating the skin and softening the hairs. Applying shaving cream after shaving does not provide these benefits, as the shaving process has already taken place.

Stachowski gave an interview Wednesday on HLN, her first since the hit show was released. Not only did Avery kill Teresa Halbach—a crime he's currently in prison for—but Stachowski says he was physically abusive to her throughout their relationship, according to Vulture. \\"He’d beat me all the time, punch me, throw me against the wall,\\" NBC Chicago quotes her as saying. Avery was wrongfully convicted of sexual assault and spent 18 years in prison. He was later convicted of murdering Halbech. Making a Murderer questions whether he was set up by police. In the interview, Stachowski says she wants the world to know \\"what a monster\\" Avery is, Vulture reports. She says Avery threatened her from jail and told her to \\"make him look good\\" for the documentary. She denies she ever loved him. According to NBC, Stachowski says Avery would follow her to work, smash her windshield to keep her from leaving the house, and once threatened to kill her by throwing a blow-dryer into the bathtub with her. She says she went as far as to eat rat poison twice in order to be hospitalized and get away from him, HLN reports. According to NBC, Stachowski says Avery thinks all women \\"owe him\\" because of the woman who misidentified him as the suspect in the sexual assault case. Avery filed a new appeal over his murder conviction this week.

Stachowski gave an interview on HLN, stating that everything she told the directors of the documentary series was a lie, and she wants the world to know \\"what a monster\\" Avery is. Furthermore, Stachowski alleges that Avery was physically abusive throughout their relationship, frequently beating her, and even threatening her from jail, directing her to \\"make him look good\\" for the documentary. She now denies that she ever loved him. During her interview, Stachowski recounts instances of violent behavior, including Avery following her to work, smashing her windshield to prevent her from leaving the house, and threatening to kill her by throwing a blow-dryer into the bathtub while she was in it.

Stachowski also said that Avery strongly believes all women \\"owe him\\" due to the woman who misidentified him as the suspect in a previous sexual assault case, which led to his wrongful conviction and 18 years in prison. However, this alleged revelation regarding Avery's guilt contradicts the premise of the documentary series, which suggests that he may have been set up by the police due to his pending lawsuit against them for his wrongful imprisonment. Avery was later convicted of murdering Teresa Halbach but has consistently maintained his innocence. He has recently filed a new appeal regarding his murder conviction in light of the national attention on his case generated by the documentary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This room, filled with the remnants of a man's life and passion, seemed like such a fitting tribute to a devoted educator.

Penora, who had been silent up until this point, finally spoke up. \\"These journals... did he write all of them?\\" Her tone was soft and reverent, as if she were standing in the presence of something sacred. Mrs. Kazmin nodded. \\"Indeed, he did. He filled those journals with his thoughts, his theories, and his discoveries. Some of those ideas changed the way people thought about mathematics and science. Others were so innovative that they opened the doors to new areas of study, paving the way for future generations of scholars.\\" Vianez and Penora exchanged glances, both of them feeling a profound sense of respect for the man who had once inhabited this space. Mrs. Kazmin gestured for the girls to follow her through the room. As they walked, she continued speaking softly about her husband. \\"He had his own unique way of viewing the world. Do you see that large wooden cabinet over there? He created that as a tangible representation of his mind. There, he would store his most precious ideas and theorems, carefully catalogued according to their significance and importance in his own body of work.\\" As they approached the cabinet, Vianez noticed that it was covered in intricate carvings, depicting various geometric shapes and mathematical symbols, much like the chalkboard. She reached out to touch the cabinet, and found herself lost in the intricate detail and craftsmanship. Her fingertips ran over the grooves and curves, and she felt a deep appreciation for the genius mind that had conceived this beautiful intersection of art and science. Mrs. Kazmin opened the cabinet, revealing rows upon rows of neatly organized parchment scrolls, leather-bound books, and stacks of paper covered in more of Mr. Kazmin's mathematical notations. Penora's eyes widened as she took in the sight. \\"I never knew so much knowledge could be contained in one place,\\" she whispered. Vianez nodded, equally awestruck. \\"Your husband... he was amazing, Mrs. Kazmin.\\" The older woman smiled, her eyes brimming with tears. \\"Yes, my dear.

It should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of Tinseltown -- \\"Hooray for Hollywood.\\" The score by Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has a number of other gems, however, including the charming \\"I'm Like a Fish Out of Water,\\" and \\"Silhouetted in the Moonlight.\\" The best musical number is \\"Let That Be a Lesson to You,\\" in which Dick Powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves \\"behind the eight-ball,\\" a fate which literally befalls slow-burning Edgar Kennedy at the number's end. The picture celebrates Hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once, as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives. The cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians--Allyn Joslyn as a crafty press agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell's would-be manager, Fritz Feld as an excitable restaurant patron, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall's sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy as a put-upon drive-in manager, Mabel Todd as Mona's goofy sister, and Hugh Herbert as her even goofier dad. The \\"racist\\" element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit where Herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo-\\"Gone With the Wind\\" sequence. It's in questionable taste, but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film, notably the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) in what I believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo.

The reviewer appreciates the various aspects of \\"Hollywood Hotel,\\" such as its entertaining musical comedy, memorable theme song, and the cast of great character comedians.

I end this small run of blog posts with the question posed by Professor Brian Boyd at the beginning of our evening: Do we want to close the achievement gap? We know we can close the gap. It’s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university. Boyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent. What kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three ‘teams’ in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing “the gap” largely on attainment. First of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide. Is the law or medicine degree we value not vocational? (Are all General Practitioners not Plumbers, as Dr Murray on the panel suggests?) Question: Dr. Murray is probably a doctor in what field?

In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces two enemies--a weapon producer named Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a horrible-looking Russian who wants revenge for something related to Tony's father. Besides the two enemies, Tony is also facing his own death. His man-made heart, which gives his Iron Man suit its power, is also harming his body.

INSTANT COLOUR TV In 1962 there was only one TV channel in Sweden, and it broadcast in black and white.The station's technical expert, Kjell Stensson, appeared on the news to announce that thanks to a newly developed technology, all viewers could now quickly and easily transform their existing sets to display colour reception.All they had to do was pull a nylon stocking over their TV screen, and they would begin to see their favorite shows in color.Reportedly, hundreds of thousands of people were taken in.Actual color TV transmission only started to appear in Sweden on April 1, 1970. SAN ERRIFFE In 1977 the British newspaper The Guardian published a special seven-page supplement in honor of the tenth anniversary of San Serriffe, a small republic located in the Indian Ocean.A series of articles affectionately described the geography and culture of this unknown nation.The Guardian's phones rang all day as readers asked for more information about the beautiful holiday spot.Few noticed that everything about the island was made up. NIXON FOR PRESIDENT In 1992 American National Public Radio's Talk of the Nation program announced that Richard Nixon, in a surprise move, was running for President again.His new campaign slogan was, \\"I didn't do anything wrong, and I won't do it again.\\" Accompanying this announcement were audio clips of Nixon delivering his election speech.Listeners responded immediately to the announcement, flooding the show with calls expressing shock and anger.Only during the second half of the show did the host John Hockenberry reveal that the announcement was a practical joke, Nixon's voice was copied by comedian Rich Little.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Q: Htin Kyaw from the National League for Democracy (NLD) takes over from Thein Sein, who introduced wide-ranging reforms during his five years in power. Although NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is barred from the presidency, she has said she will rule by proxy. The handover completes the transition that began after the NLD won a landslide win in elections in November. Thein Sein's legacy of reform Htin Kyaw, 69, said he would be \\"faithful\\" to the people of Myanmar, as he took the oath of office in a joint session of parliament in the capital Nay Pyi Taw. Vice-presidents Henry Van Thio and Myint Swe, who lost to Htin Kyaw in the presidential vote earlier this month, were also sworn in, as were new cabinet ministers. Most of the ministers belong to the NLD. The list includes Ms Suu Kyi who will be in charge of foreign affairs, the president's office, education, and energy and electric power. But the military is appointing its own nominees for three key ministries - defence, home affairs and border affairs. In a brief speech, Htin Kyaw noted challenges ahead including the need for a nationwide ceasefire. The government has been engaged in armed conflicts with various ethnic groups for decades. He also spoke about the constitution complying with modern democratic values, in a nod to the NLD's stated goal during the election campaign of changing the constitution. Correspondents say this is perhaps the most sensitive issue in the NLD government's relationship with the army, who have 25% of parliamentary seats. It means the army retains the power to veto any changes to the constitution, as that would require more than 75% of votes. The constitution contains a controversial clause barring anyone with family members who have another nationality from becoming president - widely seen as aimed at preventing Ms Suu Kyi from taking power, as her two sons are British. Despite the restriction Ms Suu Kyi, who remains hugely popular and prominent in Myanmar, has vowed to act \\"above the president\\". Last year, the NLD won 80% of contested seats in a historic election that was considered mostly free and fair and now dominates parliament. Outgoing President Thein Sein, who led a quasi-civilian government from 2011 ending decades of military rule, will hand over power to Htin Kyaw, who assumes office on 1 April. Thein Sein is credited with starting the reform process in Myanmar, also known as Burma. Five years ago Myanmar was an international pariah, rusting in the sidings. Sanctions were in place, and people were scared to speak their minds. More than 2,000 political prisoners languished in jail. Now, as Thein Sein hands over the controls to Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD, Myanmar is a country on the up. Where once people were jailed for criticising the junta, there is now a vibrant media and open public debate. The economy's growing rapidly and a telecoms revolution is under way. With a few exceptions, notably the Rohingya minority, life for Burmese people has got better, and much of the credit for that must go to the stewardship of Thein Sein. A:","completion":"Htin Kyaw from the National League for Democracy (NLD) has taken over from Thein Sein as President of Myanmar, pledging loyalty to the nation and being sworn in alongside two vice-presidents and cabinet ministers including NLD leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who will be in charge of several key ministries.

Timothy Troy Walker, 34, could face the death penalty, prosecutors said on Wednesday after he ambushed Officer Derek Johnson in Draper, Utah on September 1.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A group of people are ice skating.\\" if \\"The people are skipping rocks at the beach.\\"?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A group of people are ice skating\\" if \\"The people are skipping rocks at the beach.\\" The two activities are different and take place in distinct environments, which are incompatible with one another. In this response, I will elaborate on the differences between the two activities, the environments in which they happen, and the logical inconsistency of the provided statement. First, let's dive into the differences between ice skating and skipping rocks. Ice skating is an activity where individuals, wearing special skates with a metal blade attached, glide and perform various maneuvers on the surface of a frozen body of water or an artificial ice rink. This activity is popular during the winter months or in cold regions where ice naturally forms; alternatively, it can be enjoyed indoors at specialized rinks with artificially maintained ice throughout the year. On the other hand, skipping rocks is an activity that involves selecting flat, smooth rocks and throwing them across the surface of a body of water so that they \\"skip\\" or bounce off the water multiple times before finally sinking. This leisure activity is typically enjoyed in warmer weather at rivers, lakes, or beaches where there's easy access to rocks and calm water. Now, let's discuss the environments in which these activities occur. Ice skating demands a cold environment with a solid, flat, and slippery surface (ideally ice), whereas skipping rocks requires a body of relatively calm water as well as an abundant supply of flat rocks. These conditions are generally incompatible, as cold environments conducive to ice formation are typically not found simultaneously with the warmer weather necessary for a comfortable rock-skipping activity at a beach. Lastly, the logical inconsistency in the statement arises from the mutual exclusivity of the activities - the people cannot be both ice skating and skipping rocks at the same time, as the conditions required for each activity do not coexist. In other words, one activity negates the possibility of the other taking place. Therefore, it is impossible to conclude that a group of people is ice skating if they are, indeed, skipping rocks at the beach. In conclusion, it is not logically valid to claim that a group of people are ice skating if they are skipping rocks at the beach. The activities require different environmental conditions that are generally incompatible. Furthermore, engaging in one activity precludes the possibility of participating in the other simultaneously. Thus, the provided statement represents an inconsistency that cannot be used to draw a valid conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The sentiment can vary dramatically based on the situation and subject being discussed. To better understand the sentiment, let's examine it in different contexts: 1. Positive context - When used to describe a person, product, or experience that continually surpasses expectations, the sentiment can be perceived as positive, as it indicates that the subject is impressive and pleasantly surprising. For example: \\"The new smartphones from the company have features that constantly defy expectations.\\" In this case, the sentiment would be of admiration, fascination, and excitement for the new product and the company's innovation. 2. Ambiguous context - When used in a neutral or uncertain context, the sentiment might be more enigmatic and thought-provoking, sparking curiosity and anticipation. For example, discussing a mysterious person, \\"She is someone that constantly defies expectation.\\" In this case, the sentiment can be a mix of intrigue, apprehension, and wonder, not being entirely positive or negative but rather unexpectedly unpredictable. 3. Negative context - Although less common, the phrase can also have a negative sentiment when it is used to describe a situation or person that consistently does not meet expectations. For example, \\"He is a worker that constantly defies expectation, leaving tasks incomplete and making errors.\\" In this case, the sentiment can be perceived as frustration and disappointment due to a lack of reliability and competence. 4. Metaphysical or philosophical context - When discussing notions of life or existence that consistently defy expectations or defy conventional wisdom, the sentiment can be profound, complex, and thought-provoking. For example, \\"Quantum physics is a field that constantly defies expectation, sparking awe and fascination.\\" Here, the sentiment can be a blend of intellectual curiosity, amazement, and humility. In conclusion, the overall sentiment of the phrase \\"that constantly defies expectation\\" is highly dependent on the context in which it is used. The sentiment can range from positive admiration to negative disappointment, with plenty of room for nuance, intrigue, and complexity along the spectrum, making it an effective and evocative phrase in various situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused. - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries. - Aristophanes (or ; c. 446 c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it. - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis. - The Clouds (\\"Nephelai\\") is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes. A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens, it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423BC and was not as well-received as the author had hoped, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year. It was revised between 420 and 417BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - The Wasps (\\"Sphkes\\") is the fourth in chronological order of the eleven surviving plays by Aristophanes, the master of an ancient genre of drama called 'Old Comedy'. It was produced at the Lenaia festival in 422 BC, a time when Athens was enjoying a brief respite from the Peloponnesian War following a one-year truce with Sparta. - Carcinus ( Greek : ) was an Ancient Greek tragedian , and was a member of a family including Xenocles ( a father or uncle ) and his grandfather Carcinus of Agrigentum . He received a prize for only one out of his one hundred and sixty plays , many of them composed at the court of Dionysius II of Syracuse . Only nine titles , with associated fragments , of his plays have survived : Achilles , Aerope or Thyestes , Ajax , Alope , Amphiaraus , Oedipus , Orestes , Semele , and Tyro . He and his sons were lampooned by Aristophanes at the end of The Wasps and in Peace . All three of those sons became playwrights . Carcinus is mentioned briefly by Aristotle . In the Poetics , Chapter 17 ( 1455a lines 22 to 29 ) , Aristotle discusses the necessity for a playwright to see the composition on the stage , rather than just in print , in order to weed out any inconsistencies . Aristotle points to an unnamed play of Carcinus which had a character , Amphiaraus , exit a temple . For some reason ( presumably the events prior ) , this seemed outrageously inconsistent when viewed on the stage , and the audience \`\` hissed '' the actors right off the stage . It seems this particular inconsistency was not easily recognised by merely reading the script . - Syracuse ( \\"Syrakousai\\"; Medieval ) is a historic city in Sicily, the capital of the province of Syracuse. The city is notable for its rich Greek history, culture, amphitheatres, architecture, and as the birthplace of the preeminent mathematician and engineer Archimedes. This 2,700-year-old city played a key role in ancient times, when it was one of the major powers of the Mediterranean world. Syracuse is located in the southeast corner of the island of Sicily, next to the Gulf of Syracuse beside the Ionian Sea. - Xenocles is the name of two Greek tragedians. There were two Athenian tragic poets of this name, one the grandfather of the other. No fragments of either are currently known, except for a few words of the elder apparently parodied in Aristophanes' \\"The Clouds\\". - The Lenaia was an annual Athenian festival with a dramatic competition. It was one of the lesser festivals of Athens and Ionia in ancient Greece. The Lenaia took place in Athens in the month of Gamelion, roughly corresponding to January. The festival was in honour of Dionysos Lenaios. \\"Lenaia\\" probably comes from \\"\\"lenos\\"\\" 'wine-press' or from \\"\\"lenai\\"\\", another name for the Maenads (the female worshippers of Dionysos). - Dionysius the Younger or Dionysius II (343 BC) was a Greek politician who ruled Syracuse, Sicily from 367 BC to 357 BC and again from 346 BC to 344 BC.

Answer:","completion":"Can't answer"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Sergio Busquets was the unlikely hero for Barcelona, scoring with the last kick of the game to give Luis Enrique’s side a 1-0 win over Valencia and close the gap on Real Madrid to two points. There were 93 minutes on the clock when Lionel Messi drifted out to the right and crossed for Neymar to head goalwards. Valencia keeper Diego Alves made the save but Busquets scored from the rebound and as Messi and Co celebrated he was hit by a plastic bottle as home supporters pelted the pitch. Valencia had defended well and gone close themselves with former Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo drawing the best save of the game from Claudio Bravo. OPTIONS: - Alvaro Negredo looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Argentine looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Barcelona looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Brazilian looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Busquets looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Claudio Bravo looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - David Fernandez looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Diego Alves looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Lionel Messi looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Luis Enrique looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Manchester City looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Messi and Co looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Mestalla looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Neymar looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Nicolas Otamendi looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Otamendi looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Real Madrid looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Sergio Busquets looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Spanish looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia - Valencia looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia","completion":"In the context of the passage, the most logical way to continue would be: \\"Sergio Busquets looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia.\\" This option makes the most sense as it continues to focus on the key figure in the initial passage, Barcelona's midfielder, Sergio Busquets. Given that he scored the only goal of the game, it would be logical to continue the narrative with him leading Barcelona's attack. Moreover, the passage specifically mentions Lionel Messi drifting out to the right and Neymar heading towards the goal, implying that they're also in attacking roles. Therefore, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that Busquets, as a central figure in the play leading up to the goal, aims to steer the attacking actions during the second half. The focus would remain on the Barcelona's team dynamic, their match-winning performance, and their concerted efforts to close the gap with Real Madrid. By selecting the continuation involving Busquets, the passage would underscore the importance of this unexpected hero in this crucial clash against Valencia. It's notable that among the options given, choices involving other players, entities or nationalities (such as Argentine, Brazilian, David Fernandez, Diego Alves, Luis Enrique, Manchester City, Mestalla, Nicolas Otamendi, Otamendi, Real Madrid, Spanish, Valencia) don't integrate as smoothly into the narrative built up to that point. They either involve individuals or entities not mentioned earlier, or offer an abrupt focus shift which disrupts the narrative continuity. Furthermore, Luis Enrique is the coach and would not physically be involved in getting the attack moving. Hence, \\"Sergio Busquets looks to get Barcelona on the attack during the second half of their clash with Valencia\\" follows most logically from the given passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

For the first time, British Sign Language (BSL) was used to ask a question in the House of Commons, advocating for the legalization and further protection of BSL. Ms. Butler addressed the Commons in sign language and was cheered on by her fellow MPs, expressing the need to give BSL legal status like other recognized languages in the UK. Ms. Butler's act of using sign language in the Commons was met with widespread support from her colleagues and the public on social media, being lauded for raising awareness for the deaf community and promoting inclusiveness. Although BSL has been recognized as a minority language by the government since 2003, it still lacks legal protection, which hinders its use and promotion. In response to Ms. Butler's question, Commons Leader David Lidington acknowledged the relevance of BSL and mentioned the ongoing review by the Department for Work and Pensions on the provision of signing services. He also highlighted the Department for Education's plan to accept BSL as an alternative qualification to English functional skills for apprentices.

Summarize this article: Tobey Maguire, left, and Jake Gyllenhaal play brothers in remake of a Danish drama that explores the aftermath of war when soldiers return home. Brothers SUPPLIED PHOTO Tobey Maguire, left, and Jake Gyllenhaal play brothers in remake of a Danish drama that explores the aftermath of war when soldiers return home. Brothers (out of four) Starring Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman. Directed by Jim Sheridan. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Remakes so often suffer by comparison to their source movies, it's almost a form of punishment to look backwards. And for sure, anyone contemplating whether to see Jim Sheridan's domestic drama Brothers would be wise not to see its award-winning 2004 Danish predecessor beforehand. Susanne Bier's original Brothers exceeds Sheridan's copycat in every regard, so much so that it could taint your view of the solid lead performances by Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman. Those who do venture a peek might join me in wondering why it is the Irish filmmaker opted to make an almost scene-by-scene recreation of Bier's Brothers, yet weirdly edited out (or never filmed) the moments where the story is properly advanced and emotions are amplified. It's almost as if Sheridan and screenwriter David Benioff (The Kite Runner) were constructing a pile of old bones for a museum installation, with no live connective tissue required. It's a real shame, because Sheridan's Brothers is just good enough to make you see how it might have been great. Set in the fall of 2007 in the American heartland and also on the Afghanistan war plain, it examines the complications of decisions made both in the bedroom and on the battlefield, and also the justifications people use to explain their actions. The story turns on two brothers in motion. Dedicated soldier Capt. Sam Cahill (Maguire) is returning to Afghanistan for his fourth tour of duty with the Marines, while his ne'er-do-well sibling Tommy (Gyllenhaal) is being released from prison, having served time for some kind of bank job. Sam and Tommy aren't much alike, and they disagree over just about everything. But they love each other and get along pretty well – at least until their hard-nut father (Sam Shepard) begins needling Tommy at the family dinner table for failing to follow Sam's sterling example. Dormant tensions rise, among them the mixed feelings by Sam's wife Grace (Portman) towards Tommy. Among other things, she thinks he's not much of an uncle to the two daughters she has with Sam: Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare). Something happens in Afghanistan shortly after Sam's arrival that dramatically changes the family situation both at home and abroad. Anyone who has seen the trailer knows what it is, and also the turbulent outcome when misapprehensions, assumptions and opportunities change family dynamics. The movie contains a surprising amount of suspense, even knowing the plot basics in advance. The performances by Maguire, Gyllenhaal and Portman are all high-calibre, yet lack the natural feel of the work by their Danish counterparts. In the original Brothers, you could better understand the motivations of the characters and the decisions they make. The story of Brothers should be fertile ground for Sheridan, who has made a career-long study of complex family connections, from In the Name of the Father to The Boxer to the more recent In America. Yet he seems to be going through the motions, tracking Bier's original and sanitizing it for an American audience afraid of subtitles. Even the obligatory inclusion of a U2 song feels rote. It's still a film worth seeing, if only for the performances, but it seems to be something far short of a labour of love by Sheridan. ||||| Brothers Movie Review The word \\"melodrama\\" doesn't have much currency in movies these days, but in its best moments Brothers proves that the old genre can feel alive and well when done right. Even without major insight on its subject matter, the movie carries emotional heft thanks to stronger-than-usual performances from two of the leads The word \\"melodrama\\" doesn't have much currency in movies these days, but in its best moments Brothers proves that the old genre can feel alive and well when done right. Even without major insight on its subject matter, the movie carries emotional heft thanks to stronger-than-usual performances from two of the leads and a quiet, intuitive handling of the homefront effects of war. Coming so soon after Oren Moverman's superior and similarly themed The Messenger, Brothers sometimes feels unnecessarily Hollywood, but there's a surprising amount of truth in there as well. Living somewhere in the wintry heart of America, Grace (Natalie Portman) and Sam (Tobey Maguire) are your basic perfect couple, high school sweethearts blessed with two adorable daughters (Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare), a cozy and old-fashioned home, and Sam's career as an Army Captain. Sam is preparing to ship out to Afghanistan just as his younger brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is being released from a brief prison stint; it's clear during one particularly tense dinner which son dad (Sam Shepard) favor, and Grace is quick to rebuff Tommy's reluctant attempts at friendship as well. That all changes, though, when Sam's helicopter crashes in the Afghan desert, and Grace pulls Tommy closer to her as both cope with a giant new hole in their lives. As Sam, actually alive, struggles to survive in a POW camp, Tommy takes the girls ice skating and helps Grace remodel her kitchen, not so much as an attempt to to be with her as to craft some kind of family of his own. When Sam finally returns, having done horrible things in Afghanistan to ensure his own survival, what's intended to be a triumphant reunion becomes a series of paranoid glances and regrets, culminating in the kind of emotional explosions that feels a little over the top, yes, but also undeniably possible. Director Jim Sheridan is as excellent with the two child actresses as he was with real-life sisters in In America, but he's also got a nice touch with Gyllenhaal and Portman in the homefront scenes, coaxing out of both of them exceptional performances. While not entirely convincing as a grizzled ex-con, Gyllenhaal digs deep in his twitchy, distrustful character, and changes visibly as he becomes more comfortable in his surrogate father role. Portman, looking like a grown-up almost for the first time, is steadfast and close to brilliant as the rock-steady Grace; even when the world is collapsing all around her, Portman never reaches for the high emotion, but lets it arrive to her instead. The weak link among the three is certainly Maguire, charged with the nearly impossible task of portraying a perfect good-guy who unravels into an angry beast. In the Afghanistan scenes, with Sam in pure survival mode, Maguire works surprisingly well as a gruff commander who thinks quick on his feet. And during Sam's first few days at home, when everything feels suddenly unfamiliar, it's easy to believe that there's coiled rage behind nearly everything Sam says or does. But when it comes time for the inevitable breakdown, promoted heavily in the trailers, Maguire simply isn't up for it. Nothing in the film has led up to this kind of climax either, and when a movie that has previously relied on small moments and subtle editing suddenly explodes, it takes Maguire down with it. But despite moments in the film in which Sheridan seems to simply be cribbing, not expanding on, earlier war movies (including, probably, Susanne Bier's Danish film of the same name), Brothers is willing to take its own path often enough that it feels rewarding as a whole. Filmed without fuss and relying on performances that largely deliver, it's a simple adult drama with a story that needs to be told. Even absent perfection, that's worth something. 7 / 10 stars Rating: 3.5/5 Reviewed By: Katey Rich Blended From Around The Web Back to top ||||| Film opens Dec. 4: The jury might still be out on what to do in Afghanistan, but the public has spoken on war movies: nobody buys tickets to them anymore. It's a good thing that Hollywood hasn't seemed to notice (or care), because this year included some terrific offerings in the genre. All three movies—The Hurt Locker, The Messenger, Brothers—demonstrate that war is hell, but they also show us that the most difficult fights aren't always on the battlefield. They're often right in the kitchen, after the war, when the soldiers come face to face with loved ones who can't comprehend what combat does to a person's soul. When the main character in The Hurt Locker, a bomb-detonation expert, is asked by his wife to buy cereal or chop carrots, it's clear that he can't cope with the banality of his old life. (Article continued below…) Advertisement Your video will begin in seconds Adjust volume for sound Brothers is the most recent of the three films, and perhaps the most mainstream. Based on a 2004 Danish movie by Susanne Bier and directed by Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot), it stars Tobey Maguire as a Marine named Sam who leaves home for Afghanistan just as his brother, Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal), returns home from jail. Sam's wife, Grace (Natalie Portman), and their kids (the excellent Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare) find themselves torn between the two men: hating the father who comes back completely changed, loving the ex-con who stayed with them. The film's most powerful scene is actually set at a child's birthday party, where one of the girls won't stop rubbing a balloon to make a screeching sound. To most parents it's an everyday annoyance. To Sam the noise sounds like gunfire and serves as a reminder of how he can no longer relate to his family's happiness. It's a metaphor for his fragile psyche. Portman has some of the most difficult scenes, and this is her most accomplished work since Closer. But Brothers is Maguire's movie. So gaunt that he almost looks like a ghost, he bites into his character like a rabid dog. Brothers shows us that even when our troops do come home, their war may be far from over. © 2009 |||||","completion":"\\"Brothers\\" is a remake of a Danish drama directed by Jim Sheridan, starring Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Natalie Portman.

Article: Elizabeth's Second! In 60 years, the Queen has never put a foot wrong in public. And for the last 24 of them, it turns out she's had a secret weapon -- the nice Ella Slack. The former BBC manager has, unknown to anyone except a handful of key advisers, spent the last quarter of a century acting as the Queen's official stand-in at rehearsals for royal events. The 69-year-old has never accepted a penny for her royal service, considering it \\"a pleasure and an honour\\" to ensure that everything runs smoothly for the Queen. \\"How many people in the world have had a chance to sit in a royal landau or walk onto the dais at Windsor Castle even before the Queen has done so?\\" she said. While Miss Slack may not resemble the Queen facially, she has a similar figure to the Queen, standing just 5 foot. The Queen is 5 foot 2 inch. She began her remarkable role in 1988, when she was working as manager of the BBC's sports and events department. A producer asked her if she could stand in for the Queen to check camera angles at a rehearsal -- and her second career was born. Since then, from the State Opening of Parliament to the 50th anniversary of Victory day, wherever the Queen is on duty Miss Slack is likely to have been there first. She has perfected her own version of the Queen's clothes, including a black patent handbag she bought in a charity shop for PS1, and even styles her hair like the Queen.

Young women are more adventurous than young men when traveling abroad in gap years. One in three female backpackers visits more than three countries during a year out and travels alone, according to new research. By contrast, the majority of their male counterparts visit only one country and tend to travel in groups, says a survey by the Gap Year company, which provides information and services for students considering taking a year out. More women than men say that their prime reason for taking time off is to see the world and experience different cultures. Men were more likely to rank \\"having fun\\" higher on their list of priorities. Women were more likely to value the challenge of a foreign trip, and many cited reasons such as learning a language and meeting new people. The more adventurous gap years taken by women seem to work to their benefit: more than three quarters of those surveyed reported increased confidence, self-reliance and independence, whereas only half of the men had that experience. The research also showed that women were more likely to do voluntary work while traveling, with more than one in ten helping with teaching or development projects. One of the reasons given for this is a wish to see the country in an authentic light. A greater proportion of women than men faced objections or criticism from their families over their gap-year plans. Among the men surveyed, lack of money was the main barrier to travel. Carolyn Martin, a doctor from London, was a typically confident female traveler. Starting in Cape Town, she traveled around southern Africa and Australia with a string of unusual and sometimes dangerous jobs. \\"I had one job chasing elephants off the runway in Africa by banging a stick against a pan,\\" she recalled. \\"It was OK but one day I did get chased by one.\\" She said that she had traveled alone because \\"you meet more people\\". 1.

However, her father Sir Walter Elliot (Anthony Head) and family friend Lady Russell (Alice Krige) had persuaded Anne to break off the engagement and give up the man she loved because of his lack of fortune and connections. As the story opens, however, the Elliot family is in financial difficulties due to the lavish spending of Sir Walter and his eldest daughter Elizabeth (Julia Davis). To save expense, the Elliot family residence, Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire, has to be let out. Suitable tenants are soon found in Admiral Croft (Peter Wight) and his wife (Marion Bailey). Mrs. Croft is the sister of Frederick Wentworth, who has risen to the rank of Captain and become rich while serving in the Royal Navy. Sir Walter and Elizabeth Elliot depart for their new residence in Bath. Anne stays behind to visit her hypochondriac sister Mary Musgrove (Amanda Hale) who is married to Charles Musgrove (Sam Hazeldine), and living in the nearby estate Uppercross.

Canadian researchers published that sea rocket,a common seashore plant,can recognize its siblings.Susan Dudley observed that when siblings are grown next to each other in the soil,they \\"play nice\\" and don't send out more roots to compete.However,the moment one of the plants is thrown in with strangers,it begins competing with them by rapidly growing more roots to take up the water and mineral nutrients in the soil. After reading Dudley's study,Bais decided to find the method behind the sibling recognition.Working in his laboratory,Bais and his doctoral student Meredith Biedrzycki set up a study with wild populations of Arabidopsis thaliana.In a series of experiments,young seedlings were exposed to liquid media containing the root secretions from siblings,from strangers,or only their own secretions.The length of the longest lateral root was measured.The exposure of plants to the root secretions of strangers induced greater lateral root formation than exposure of plants to sibling secretions.Strangers planted next to each other are often shorter,because so much of their energy is directed at root growth.Because siblings aren't competing against each other,their roots are often much shallower .

Paragraph: On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits. Charles Ares, a member of the board of directors in the 1950s, said the office was kind of a charity operation.

Objective: To get rid of moles in your yard, Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Choose your answer from: (i) the most effective method is to catch them in a trap and release them in a wooded area, far away from your home.; (ii) the most effective method is to catch them in a trap and release them in a wooded area, near your job.;","completion":"Between the two options presented, both involving trapping and relocating the moles, I will analyze them based on naive physics reasoning to identify the more sound solution. Option (i): Catching the moles in a trap and releasing them in a wooded area far away from your home. Justification: 1. Trap the moles: In this step, we are capturing the moles without causing harm. This process is both humane and effective in removing moles from your yard. 2. Transport to a faraway wooded area: By relocating the moles to a distant wooded area, we significantly reduce the likelihood of the moles returning to your yard. A natural wooded habitat is also more suitable for their survival and well-being. 3. Release moles: Releasing the moles in the new location allows them to continue living in an environment where they will have less impact on human property. Option (ii): Catching the moles in a trap and releasing them in a wooded area near your job. Justification: 1. Trap the moles: Just like in the first option, this step is also humane and effective in removing moles from your yard. 2. Transport to a wooded area near your job: Relocating the moles to a wooded area close to your job might create a similar problem for someone else or even for you if the area is not far enough from your original location. 3. Release moles: Releasing the moles in a wooded area near your job might not be as effective in preventing the moles from returning to your yard or causing damage to other properties. Based on this naive physics reasoning, I would conclude that option (i) is more sound, as it reduces the chances of the moles returning to your yard and ensures that moles find a suitable habitat far away from human property."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

By placing a wire cooling rack on top of the pot, you create a barrier that prevents the water from overflowing. The spaces in the rack also allow steam to escape, preventing pressure from building up inside the pot.

Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Jeremy Kerr, a researcher at the University of Ottawa in Canada, and his colleagues analyzed more than 400,000 observations of bumblebee species collected in North America and Europe from 1975 to 2010. When the researchers recorded the locations of these bee populations, they found that many of the 67 species analyzed were moving northward from their southern limits while the northern edges of the bees' ranges are staying in place. What it results in is obvious. Bees have been paid more attention to in recent years, with populations of honeybees and bumblebees obviously declining in some parts of Europe. Previously, attention on the decline of bee populations has focused on causes including habitat loss, pesticide use and the spread of bee parasites . But the work by Kerr's team found something different. \\"For every species, there is one or two species declining and others that are not moving at all,\\" says Kerr. This shift has also been observed in other species, such as butterflies. But due to a new cause -- the rise of temperatures instead of total pesticide use, a change in land use or parasites, bumblebees -- unlike butterflies -- have failed to extend the northern boundaries of their ranges into the territory that is now habitable for them, so bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining rapidly, the latest study led by Kerr's team finds. \\"Our data suggest that the new factor plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend,\\" says Kerr. \\"This study shows that a fourth factor is also beginning to affect it. It is likely that the combined stresses from all of these pressures will have destructive impacts on bumblebees in the not-too-distant future,\\" says Dave Goulson, a bee researcher at the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. Exactly what can be done to help bumblebees is not clear. Kerr's team suggests that relocating colonies might be an answer but Goulson says that because the insects are mobile they are capable of moving northwards if there is suitable habitat available. Question: What's the new cause of bee populations' declining according to Kerr? Options: A: Habitat loss. B: Pesticide use. C: Climate change. D: The spread of bee parasites.","completion":"The new cause of bee populations' declining, according to Kerr, is C: Climate Change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Analyze Sentence 2 - \\"Do I know anything about running a business?\\" This is also a question, specifically asking about the person's knowledge of running a business. 3. Compare the two sentences. Both sentences are asking questions about the person's knowledge. The first sentence is about general business knowledge, while the second sentence is specifically about running a business. Now, let's evaluate the answer choices. a) yes - The second sentence examines a specific aspect of business knowledge - running a business. However, it is not definitively stated in the first sentence that they know anything about running a business. b) it is not possible to tell - This choice states that we cannot determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. The first sentence discusses general knowledge about business, while the second sentence asks about running a business knowledge specifically. It is not explicitly clear whether the person's business knowledge includes information on running a business or not. c) no - This answer choice would imply that the second sentence has no relation to the first sentence. However, both sentences are related as they discuss knowledge about business, with the second sentence asking about a specific aspect of that knowledge. Taking these analyses into consideration, the best answer choice would be: b) it is not possible to tell This is because the first sentence asks about general business knowledge, while the second sentence asks about a specific aspect (running a business).

Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon?

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 3*u - 11 + 5 = 0, we must manipulate the equation to isolate the variable u. Here are the steps: Step 1: Handle the constants. Start by simplifying the constants on the left side of the equation: 3*u - 11 + 5 = 3*u - 6 = 0 Step 2: We continue solving for u by adding 6 to both sides of the equation to balance it: 3*u - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6 This simplifies to: 3*u = 6 Step 3: The final step is to get u by itself. We can achieve this by dividing every term by 3: (3*u) / 3 = 6 / 3 Therefore: u = 2 So the solution to your equation 3*u - 11 + 5 = 0 is u = 2. This means that when u equals 2, the equation balances. You can always check your work by plugging the answer for u back into the original equation to make sure the left side equals the right side."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Given the below context: Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum's 2012 exhibition \\"The Early Dürer\\". Guess a valid title for it!

Background: Antoine Dominique \\"Fats\\" Domino Jr. (February 26, 1928 - October 24, 2017) was an American pianist and singer-songwriter. One of the pioneers of rock and roll music, Domino sold more than 65 million records. Between 1955 and 1960, he had eleven Top 10 hits. His humility and shyness may be one reason his contribution to the genre has been overlooked. Context: Domino moved to ABC-Paramount Records in 1963. The label dictated that he record in Nashville, Tennessee, rather than New Orleans. He was assigned a new producer (Felton Jarvis) and a new arranger (Bill Justis). Domino's long-term collaboration with the producer, arranger, and frequent co-writer Dave Bartholomew, who oversaw virtually all of his Imperial hits, was seemingly at an end. Jarvis and Justis changed the Domino sound somewhat, notably by adding the backing of a countrypolitan-style vocal chorus to most of his new recordings. He released 11 singles for ABC-Paramount, several which hit the Top 100 but just once entering the Top 40 (\\"Red Sails in the Sunset\\", 1963). By the end of 1964 the British Invasion had changed the tastes of the record-buying public, and Domino's chart run was over. Despite the lack of chart success, Domino continued to record steadily until about 1970, leaving ABC-Paramount in mid-1965 and recording for Mercury Records, where he delivered a live album and two singles. A studio album was planned but stalled with just four tracks recorded . Dave Bartholomew's small Broadmoor label (reuniting with Bartholomew along the way), featured many contemporary Soul infused sides but an album was released overseas in 1971 to fulfill his Reprise Records contract. He shifted to that label after Broadmoor and had a Top 100 single, a cover of the Beatles' \\"Lady Madonna\\". Domino appeared in the Monkees' television special 33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee in 1969. He continued to be popular as a performer for several decades. He made a cameo appearance in Clint Eastwood's movie Any Which Way You Can, filmed in 1979 and released in 1980 singing the country song \\"Whiskey Heaven\\" which later became a minor hit. His life and career were showcased in Joe Lauro's 2015 documentary The Big Beat: Fats Domino and the Birth of Rock 'n' Roll. Question: What did Fats record after leaving Imperial?

Write an article based on this summary: Alexandre Mapokopero is proud to work for SNCC, the national railway of the Democratic Republic of Congo, but the last time he actually mounted a train was back in June. Article:","completion":"Title: Alexandre Mapokopero and the Journey of SNCC: The Struggle of the Democratic Republic of Congo's Railway System In the vast, mineral-rich heart of Africa, lies the Democratic Republic of Congo - the second largest country in the continent with enormous potential for economic growth and development. Yet, despite its abundant natural resources, including copper, cobalt, and diamonds, the nation has struggled to overcome poverty, malnutrition, and political instability for decades. One of the critical aspects of a thriving nation is a well-functioning transportation system, and in this regard, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has a bittersweet love affair with its national railway, The Société Nationale des Chemins de fer du Congo (SNCC). Alexandre Mapokopero, an enthusiastic and proud employee of the SNCC, personifies the hope and determination of his fellow Congolese citizens. Standing alongside his colleagues, he envisions the day when the railway system, once the pride and joy of the nation, shall overcome its current dilapidated state and return to its former glory. However, the realities of modern-day Congo seem far removed from this dream. Mapokopero last set foot on a train back in June, a testament to the grave challenges that the SNCC faces daily. The national railway of the Democratic Republic of Congo was once a critical lifeline. Its trains provided much-needed employment and economic growth, transporting people and goods across the vast territory to spur development and reduce poverty. Established in 1974, the current SNCC was born from a merger between the Vicicongo railway and the Office des Transports Coloniale. This merger was meant to streamline the railway and create a more cohesive system. However, the years that followed saw anything but steady progress. A victim of political instability, economic downturns, and lack of proper maintenance, the SNCC has crumbled, much like the broader infrastructure of the DRC. The railway lines, which once traversed over 5,000 kilometers and connected the eastern and western halves of the country, have deteriorated to the point where only a fraction of them are still in use today. Furthermore, the lack of proper funding and investment, combined with rampant corruption, has left the SNCC in a precarious position, struggling to provide even the most basic of services and sorely lacking in resources. Despite the various challenges faced by the SNCC, employees like Alexandre Mapokopero are holding onto the hope that change is possible. Many Congolese people are deeply aware of the potential benefits a thriving railway system could bring to their country - improved access to jobs, better connections between communities, increased regional trade, and even a bolster to the nation's tourism industry. The revival of the national railway is intrinsically linked to the broader goals of promoting economic development, social integration, and sustainable growth across the Democratic Republic of Congo. While there have been some recent signs of a potential revival, with the World Bank approving a 225 million loan in 2018 to rehabilitate over 1,100 kilometers of decrepit railway lines, the road to recovery is an arduous one. Dedicated employees like Alexandre Mapokopero will continue to embody the enduring hope and determination that fuels the Democratic Republic of Congo as it strives to rise from its troubled past. As Alexandre anxiously awaits his next opportunity to board a train, thousands of kilometers of rusty, dilapidated tracks quietly yearn for the day when they once again transport the dreams of the Congolese people to a brighter future. It is through the determined spirit of individuals like Mapokopero that the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to persist in their pursuit of progress and the resurrection of their once-glorious railway system - the SNCC."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Though Diamond's presentation of geographic determinism contains interesting information, it ultimately caves under itself as Diamond consistently brushes away the idea that culture had anything to do with regional success, choosing instead to embrace the notion of continental diffusion axes, and at a point, the shape of coastlines (the latter of which indicates some of the outrageous claims in this book). \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" sounds reasonable at times but as a whole is remarkably far-fetched.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: If you ask someone why he or she wears clothes, the answer will probably be \\"to keep warm and to cover my body\\". These are the basic reasons why clothes are worn, but people also want to look attractive and appear successful to others. If people only wore clothes for warmth and to cover their bodies, most clothes would be simple and cheap. In most Western countries, however, clothes are sometimes very expensive. The main reason for this is not the cost of the cloth or the cost of making the clothes. The clothes are expensive because of fashion . Successful businessmen, for example, often wear very expensive suits, shirts and ties. Sometimes they pay thousands of dollars for a suit and hundreds of dollars for a tie. It's just a suit and a tie but they pay these prices because of the famous name of the designer. A suit costing much less would be just as warm and would cover the wearer's body just as well. Fashion is always changing, which means those who want to be fashionable have to buy new clothes every few months, even if last month's clothes have only been worn once or twice. Some people have wardrobes full of clothes that have hardly been worn but are no longer in fashion. Being fashionable, therefore, can be a very expensive pastime !

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to).

Plot title: Nayak Movie plot: A famous film actor Arindam (Uttam Kumar), a star of Bengali films, has been invited to the capital to receive a prestigious award. As all the flights are booked, he is forced to travel by a train from Calcutta to New Delhi. He is in a foul mood as the morning's papers are filled with his being involved in an altercation and his latest film is slated to become his first flop.In the restaurant car, he meets Aditi (Sharmila Tagore), a young journalist who edits a serious women's magazines. Filled with contempt for the likes of him, she secretly plans to interview him because she thinks it would make a saleable 'copy'. It soon leads to him pouring out his life history. Aditi takes notes, surreptitiously. Critical of the star, she interrogates him and the star ends up re-examining his life. In a series of conversations with Aditi, he reveals his past and guilt.He talks about Shankarda, his mentor, taking us back to his early youth. His selling out to films and giving up theatre against the wishes of his old teacher... His first day's shoot, and he being snubbed by a successful actor Mukunda Lahiri. A few years later Mukunda Lahiri, now a forgotten actor after a series of flops, comes to him to beg for a small part. He rejects the ageing actor in revenge. His taking refuge in alcohol. And his refusing to help a friend in politics.In the fag end of the train journey, he is drunk and contemplates suicide. He asks the conductor to fetch Aditi. He begins to confess an affair with a married woman. But Aditi stops him. It was an affair with a heartless and ambitious Promila, which ended in a brawl with her husband.As the star re-lives and examines his life with Aditi, a bond develops between them. Aditi realises that in spite of his fame and success, Arindam is a lonely man, and needs her sympathy and understanding. Out of respect for his frank confession, she chooses to suppress the story and tears up the notes she has written. She lets the hero preserve his public image. My question: Why is Arindam Mukherjee going to the capital? A:","completion":"Arindam Mukherjee, the key character in the movie 'Nayak,' is heading to the capital because he has been selected to receive a prestigious award there. As a well-known actor in Bengali films, this recognition is significant for his career and professional standing in the movie industry. Despite the hurdles he's facing in his personal and professional life, this journey offers him a moment of victory and respect on a national level that he looks forward to and is determined to reach. With a recent altercation that made the headlines and a probable flop film on the horizon, his journey to the capital for receiving this award is laden with a deeper symbolic meaning as well. He is on the precipice of his failures and defamation, while simultaneously being hailed with an award celebrating his career's successes. This juxtaposition augments the complexities of his character and propels the narrative forward, laying a solid groundwork for the ensuing interactions with the journalist, Aditi, and the introspection that it leads to. So, in essence, Arindam Mukherjee's journey to the capital is a significant plot device that catalyses certain key aspects of the narrative in the film 'Nayak'. Under the guise of receiving a prestigious award, it enables him to introspect his past actions, guilt, loneliness, relationships, and the facade of stardom, eventually leading to self-discovery and change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This problem is asking us to find the value of \\"q\\". We can start by adding together the two q's, so it will be (217+3670)*q = 388700. When we add 217 and 3670 together, we get 3887. So, we get 3887*q = 388700. Now, we want to find \\"q,\\" so we need to do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing. Therefore, we divide 388700 by 3887. When we do this, we get 100. So q is equal to 100. This is a bit like saying if you have 388700 candies and you divide them equally among 3887 kids, each kid would get 100 candies.

Plot title: Never Cry Wolf Movie plot: Young, naive Canadian biologist Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) is assigned by the government to travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the area's caribou population is declining, believed to be due to wolf-pack attacks; amongst his orders to study them he is also given a gun and required to kill one wolf and examine its stomach contents. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler in the middle of a sub-zero frozen Arctic lake. Tyler is at a loss of what to do about his situation until he is rescued by a traveling Inuit named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who transports him and his gear off the ice and builds a shelter for him. Alone, Tyler divides his days between research and survival, while nights are fraught with nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves â which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them. He and the wolves begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them. Noticing that they haven't eaten any caribou and only mice, he begins a side experiment of eating only mice for protein sustenance. Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, is content and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems not only more reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly due to the fact that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled.

The statistical wizard's offer to wager on the outcome of the presidential race is a bad choice. How does The Times decide which comments to post on NYTimes.com? The public editor gets answers from The Times's online commenting managers. Readers complained to the public editor over The Times's decision to display a photograph of the unconscious ambassador in Libya. Those who reveal classified material are being punished like never before. When the government asks newspapers to keep quiet, the bar should be very high for saying yes. Editors were asked by the C.I.A. to withhold information and did so for months before publishing it online Tuesday night. Scott Shane, a Times national security reporter, was referred to in the government’s prosecution of a former C.I.A. official. Bradley Manning and WikiLeaks are a major story for The Times, so why was the paper so late to cover the soldier’s pretrial hearing? The testimony is riveting and the surrounding issues are newsworthy. Just who is it that the United States is killing with strikes by unmanned aircraft in Yemen and Pakistan? The First Amendment matters for many reasons, some of them not on the world stage. The public editor travels to Harvard’s Shorenstein Center. With audio. Is the concept outdated or even more important in the new media era? The journalistic ideal of impartiality is coming under attack. My column for this week. The public editor speaks with Times editors about how they plan to fact-check the first presidential debate. When opinion appears in news pages, it needs to be labeled and displayed as just that. Whatever the conclusions, whatever the effectiveness, of challenging facts, the idea that we have to debate the necessity of the media doing so strikes me as absurd. The Times is reconsidering the use of the term “illegal immigrant.” An article coyly wrote around a business name that used an unprintable word according to The Times's standards. A crisis in North Africa and a reader’s query bring up crucial distinctions in usage. Families are rightfully upset by some of the early reporting done on the Newtown, Conn., shootings. The research and development team’s Chronicle tool may distract you while you’re waiting for the returns to come in. Unidentified sources make it difficult for readers to know what to believe regarding negotiations between the United States and Iran. The public editor's judgment is not about immigration reform; it's about clarity and accuracy. An activist wants The Times to stop using the term “illegal immigrant” in its reporting. After criticism on Twitter and elsewhere, the first sentence of an obituary for Yvonne Brill was changed. A front-page article involving the New York Police Department's internal communication could have provided greater context. A headline ignites a discussion about its “undermining” question.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -268*s = -250*s + 36 for s, we will follow these steps: 1. Isolate the term containing the variable s. 2. Simplify the equation. 3. Solve for s. Step 1: Isolate the term containing the variable s. We want to isolate s on one side of the equation. Currently, there are terms with s on both sides (-268*s on the left side and -250*s on the right side). Let's bring the term with s from the left side to the right side by adding 268*s to both sides of the equation. -268*s + 268*s = -250*s + 36 + 268*s This simplifies to: 0 = 18*s + 36 Now the term with s is on the right side of the equation. Step 2: Simplify the equation. Now we will simplify the equation further. We have an equation in the form: 0 = 18*s + 36 To solve for s, we want to get s by itself on the right side of the equation. To do this, let's first isolate the term with s by subtracting 36 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 36 = 18*s + 36 - 36 This simplifies to: -36 = 18*s Step 3: Solve for s. Now we have a simple equation in the form -36 = 18*s. We just need to divide both sides by 18 to find the solution for s: -36 / 18 = 18*s / 18 This simplifies to: -2 = s So, the solution for the equation -268*s = -250*s + 36 is s = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether your goiter shrinks or not after you quit, you can take pride in achieving an important health goal. levels to balance your hormones. Excessive stress may throw your hormones out of balance, so it’s conceivable (if unproven) that it may contribute to goiters. Regardless, reducing excessive stress will do wonders for your overall physical and emotional health. Stress-relief techniques can include activities like meditation, yoga, mindfulness practices, prayer, physical exercise, and spending time with friends. Basically, find what works for you and stick with it. Once again, this is a healthy lifestyle change that has only a tangential (at best) connection to goiters. However, getting an adequate amount of high-quality sleep is most certainly good for you overall, so it’s not a stretch to think it may provide some benefits toward goiter reduction and/or prevention. There is also evidence that not getting enough sleep can affect the production of thyroid hormones. Simple steps toward sleeping better include creating a comfortable sleeping environment, following a consistent sleep routine, and turning off all screens (TV, phone, etc.) at least an hour before bedtime. The average adult should aim for 6-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night. While there are some foods you may need to emphasize or avoid based on your iodine needs, an overall healthy diet may be beneficial in promoting better thyroid health. Likewise, it’s possible (but not certain) that eating smaller, more frequent meals might maintain hormonal balance better and therefore combat goiters.

Step 3: Eliminate unlikely options - \\"Internet cafe\\" can be eliminated because it isn't related to putting groceries away, and Sean went to his room to use his computer, not an internet cafe. - \\"Mug\\" and \\"teapot\\" can be eliminated because they are typically used for drinking tea, not for storing teabags or groceries. Step 4: Evaluate remaining options This leaves us with \\"refrigerator\\" and \\"cupboard.\\" Step 5: Choose the most appropriate option Teabags are typically stored in a dry and cool place, which is usually a cupboard in most households. Storing them in a refrigerator is less common and may lead to moisture in the teabags. Therefore, based on the common practice of storing teabags and groceries, the most appropriate option would be \\"cupboard.\\" So, Sean would have put the teabags in the \\"cupboard\\" after putting his groceries away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Dead Snow Movie plot: A woman, Sara, is being chased through the snows of Norway. She is ultimately cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II Nazi SS uniforms. Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream. Meanwhile, the hiker has set up camp in the mountains and is eating dinner when he is disturbed by a noise outside. He investigates, and is attacked and killed by a zombie. The next morning, Vegard, out looking for Sara, discovers the hiker's body. He searches the area, falls through the snow into a cave, and is knocked unconscious. After sunset, Erlend finds an old wooden box filled with valuables and golden trinkets. They celebrate, and one of them pockets a gold coin. They eventually return the rest of the treasure to the box. Erlend goes to the outhouse where he and Chris have sex. Afterwards, Erlend return to the cabin, and drops a gold coin. Chris is attacked by a zombie, and killed. The others leave the cabin to look for her, and find Sara's rucksack buried in the snow. Upon returning to the cabin, they are attacked. Erlend is killed in an attempt... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Dead Snow\\", Vegard stabs the zombie in the eye with a knife. This happens during the scene when the group is being attacked by zombies at the cabin, and Vegard has to defend himself and his friends from the undead Nazis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mori trains his grandchildren in the art of Ninjutsu. As the summer comes to an end, Mori gives each of them a new \\"ninja\\" name based on their personalities: 'Rocky', 'Colt', and 'Tum-Tum'. Meanwhile, the boys' father, Sam Douglas, is an FBI agent who stages a sting operation to entrap Hugo Snyder in the sale of warheads. Snyder escapes the trap with the use of his own ninja henchmen. Snyder decides to test Mori's fighting skill. The boys ignore Mori's orders to stay in the house and aid by defeating two ninjas on their own. Snyder threatens Mori's family if he doesn't get Douglas off his back, and Mori chides the boys briefly for interfering in his personal affairs. When they return home, they find their father unenthusiastic to see what they had learned during their visit and more annoyed at their new names. Emily, a friend of Rocky's, compliments his new name and agrees to ride with them to school the next day. Snyder develops a plan to kidnap the boys to use them as leverage to get Douglas to back off.

They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \\"lived for this kinda shit.\\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that. Once he was there, helping them come up with the plan and then actually carrying it out, it sure as hell was exciting - probably the most exciting thing he'd ever done. Now that he was home and alone with his misgivings and paranoia, it all seemed like a really stupid idea. If it weren't for Chloe and her mesmerizing enthusiasm, there's no doubt that he wouldn't be doing this at all. But it was too late now. Or was it? It was five in the morning when Paul got back to his apartment. He'd told Chloe that he wanted to get a few hours sleep before the big meeting, but he now realized that there was no way he was going to be able to relax.

Context: The Iraqi revolt against the British, also known as the 1920 Iraqi Revolt or Great Iraqi Revolution, started in Baghdad in the summer of 1920 with mass demonstrations by Iraqis, including protests by embittered officers from the old Ottoman army, against the British occupation of Iraq. The revolt gained momentum when it spread to the largely tribal Shia regions of the middle and lower Euphrates. Sheikh Mehdi Al-Khalissi was a prominent Shia leader of the revolt. Sunni and Shia religious communities cooperated during the revolution as well as tribal communities, the urban masses, and many Iraqi officers in Syria. The objectives of the revolution were independence from British rule and creation of an Arab government. Though the revolt achieved some initial success, by the end of October 1920, the British had crushed the revolt. Although the revolt was largely over by the end of 1920, elements of it dragged on until 1922. During the 1920 revolt, another anti-British rebellion took place in the north Iraq by the Kurds, who were trying to gain independence. One of the major Kurdish leaders of the Kurdish revolt was Sheikh Mahmoud Barzanji. Question: How many years do these events span for?

We need to move all the terms not containing the variable to the other side of the equation. Currently, the equation is: -8*w + 71 = 31 Step 2: Move the constant term (71) to the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. Subtract 71 from both sides of the equation: -8*w + 71 - 71 = 31 - 71 Which simplifies to: -8*w = -40 Step 3: Solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of w, which is -8.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-arising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan and the Greco-Indian Kingdom (180 BC - 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). The first figural portrayals of the Buddha, previously avoided by Buddhists, appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth. The Yavanajataka and Paulisa Siddhanta texts in particular show Greek influence.

On a train trip, lawyer Richard Grant tells fellow passengers that, based on his long experience both prosecuting and defending murder cases, murder is sometimes justified and a clever man should be able to commit it undetected. He is traveling to the isolated estate of his wealthy client and friend, Gordon Rich; his young adult daughter Barbara surprises him at the train station, where she informs him that she has already been there a week. Grant's view is soon put to the test. Rich asks him to rewrite his will, including bequests to all his former mistresses (except one who is dead already; she was just 16, and Grant believes it was suicide). When Rich explains that he wants a new will because he intends to marry Barbara, Grant is appalled. He repeats what he said on the train. Rich deserves to be murdered, and if that is what it takes to stop the marriage, Grant will do it and get away with it. Rich retorts that if necessary he will retaliate from beyond the grave. Grant pleads with his daughter, pointing out the great age difference and Rich's indecent character. But she loves Rich and is adamant. Nor has Tommy Osgood, a young man Barbara had been seeing, been able to change her mind. At a dinner party that night, Rich announces the wedding and says it will take place in the morning.

Write an article based on this summary: – Federal health inspectors discovered listeria inside the packing facility of the Colorado farm that shipped out lethal cantaloupes, killing 25 people so far, reports USA Today. FDA officials also found several sanitation problems, including dirty and contaminated equipment that could explain how listeria spread to the fruit. For example, a truck that ferried waste cantaloupes to a cattle farm was parked near the open-air packing facility. Cow manure on the wheels could have infected the produce, say officials. Other violations at Jensen Farms included pools of water on the floor and a dirty potato-washing machine (for the cantaloupes) that could have introduced listeria into the facility. The farm bought the hard-to-clean washer in July, the same month the outbreak started, notes AP.","completion":"Title: Listeria Outbreak Linked to Contaminated Cantaloupes: A Case Study on Jensen Farms' Packing Facility Introduction In September 2011, an outbreak of listeria was linked to contaminated cantaloupes from Jensen Farms, a Colorado-based farm. This outbreak led to the deaths of 25 people, making it one of the deadliest foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States in decades. Federal health inspectors exposed multiple sanitation problems within Jensen Farms' packing facility, which ultimately furthered the spread of listeria to the cantaloupes. Contaminated Equipment and Sanitation Problems The FDA conducted inspections at Jensen Farms' packing facility, which resulted in the discovery of listeria inside the facility. Several sanitation issues were found, including dirty and contaminated equipment that could explain how listeria spread to the cantaloupes. One notable issue was a truck used to transport waste cantaloupes to a cattle farm parked near the open-air packing facility. Officials speculated that cow manure on the wheels of the truck could have infected the produce. Other violations at Jensen Farms included pools of water on the floor, which can become breeding grounds for bacteria such as listeria. In addition to these issues, a dirty potato-washing machine was used to clean cantaloupes, further increasing the chances of listeria contamination. Jensen Farms purchased the hard-to-clean washer in July, which coincided with the beginning of the outbreak. The Listeria Outbreak Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium commonly found in soil, water, and animal feces. The bacteria can cause severe illness in humans, particularly among pregnant women, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal problems. In severe cases, the infection can lead to meningitis or even death. The listeria outbreak linked to Jensen Farms' cantaloupes affected individuals across multiple states, with a total of 25 confirmed deaths and numerous hospitalizations. The outbreak raised concerns about the safety of the food supply chain, particularly regarding the sanitation practices of farms and packing facilities. The Impact and Lessons Learned In the wake of the outbreak, Jensen Farms was forced to recall their cantaloupes and eventually filed for bankruptcy. The owners of the farm pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges related to the introduction of adulterated food into interstate commerce and were sentenced to probation and community service. The tragic consequences of the Jensen Farms' case highlight the importance of proper sanitation practices and adherence to food safety guidelines in the agriculture industry. To prevent similar outbreaks, farms and packing facilities must invest in effective cleaning and sanitation measures, as well as regular inspections to ensure compliance with food safety standards. Furthermore, the outbreak serves as a reminder for consumers to be vigilant about food safety in their own homes. Washing produce thoroughly before consumption can help reduce the risk of contracting foodborne illnesses. For more vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and pregnant women, it is particularly important to avoid high-risk foods and maintain a clean kitchen environment. In conclusion, the listeria outbreak stemming from Jensen Farms stands as a somber example of the devastating consequences of inadequate sanitation practices. Lessons can be gleaned from this tragedy to inform better practices in the agriculture industry, ensuring that future outbreaks can be better mitigated, and ultimately protecting the health and well-being of consumers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Factories around the world produce lots of CFCs which deplete the ozone layer. One year a large number of these factories decided they would implement efforts to reduce the amount of CFCs they release into the atmosphere. As a result the depletion of the ozone layer greatly decreased. However, the companies realized that this was hurting profits too much and reverted their decision. As a result the ozone layer began to rapidly deplete again. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will reducing the amount of CFCs released into the atmosphere increase or decrease ozone depletion? Hint: Beginning in the late 1970’s, ozone depletion was recognized as a significant environmental issue. The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels. Answer:","completion":"Reducing the amount of CFCs released into the atmosphere will decrease ozone depletion. This is because CFCs are known to deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine atoms, which react with ozone molecules and break them apart. In the given scenario, when factories implemented efforts to reduce CFC emissions, the depletion of the ozone layer greatly decreased. However, when they reverted their decision, the ozone layer began to rapidly deplete again. Therefore, it is clear that reducing CFC emissions can help in decreasing ozone depletion. This has been recognized globally, leading to the reduction of CFC usage in recent years, in hopes of restoring the ozone layer to its earlier levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the current Clean Air Act has played a role in significantly improving some of these issues, additional reductions in the emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury are necessary to address persistent public health and environmental problems. Does it follow that \\"The Clean Air Act did nothing to improve the environment.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not follow that \\"The Clean Air Act did nothing to improve the environment.\\" The Clean Air Act has played a significant part in mitigating the environmental issues such as the release of harmful pollutants into the air by establishing limits on the emission of pollutants and implementing ways in which industries and businesses can reduce their emissions. Since its enactment in 1970 by the U.S. Congress and subsequent amendment in 1990, the Clean Air Act has effectually seen the reduction of some of the most harmful air pollutants known to not only cause environmental harm but also severe health problems. The Act has made way for a manifold of federal regulations which include measures to control the emission of pollutants from stationary and mobile sources as well as the regulation of hazardous air pollutants. Critics have recognized that it is a benchmark U.S. environmental legislation which has by far been successful in improving the air quality in the U.S., albeit the objective of completely mitigating air pollution is yet to be fully reached. While the Act has led to a significant reduction in the emissions of many pollutants, the necessity for further reductions in the emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury as stipulated in the question is recognized. The continuous emission of these pollutants is still a pressing issue as they contribute to environmental problems such as acid rain, ground-level ozone, and the contamination of fish by mercury. Moreover, from a public health perspective, these pollutants known for their respiratory and cardiovascular impacts, increase the risk of premature death and other serious health effects such as bronchitis, asthma attacks, and other severe respiratory diseases. Recognizing these challenges does not negate the positive impact and progress made by the Clean Air Act, but rather emphasizes the need for continual advancements to further reduce emissions and combat air pollution. Policies, like any other tool, should constantly adapt to the unique demands of its time to provide the most effective results. It’s fair to surmise that the Clean Air Act is not a failure but a work in progress, needing refinement and reinforcement to continue improving public health and defending the environment."},{"prompt":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

The Kingdom of Mysore reached a peak in economic power under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, in the post-Mughal era of the mid-late 18th century. They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithing, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.The Mysore silk industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it however revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.Under Tipu Sultan, Mysore enjoyed one of the world's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century, higher than Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than 400 (1990 international dollars), or 2,000 per capita.

Washington, D.C. ties record for most straight 95+ days, more coming Asterisk indicates daily and monthly record high temperature. Gray text indicates predicted temperature.In terms of the duration of a punishing heat wave, the current spell has arrived at historic levels in Washington, D.C.. For the 8th straight day (as of noon today, when it was 97), the temperature has reached at least 95 degrees - tying 2002, 1993, and 1987 for the most such days on record. Related link: 90 degree days in Washington, D.C.: Yearly, seasonal and monthly averages and extremes It’s very likely we will add three more days to this tally through Sunday - making this heat wave in D.C. history unmatched with respect to the miserable combination of length and intensity. How hot might it get? Triple-digit heat is possible daily through Sunday. The hottest day is likely to be Saturday, when highs may reach 102-106. What are the records? Will they be broken? NAM model projects 5 p.m. temperatures at or above 105 degrees Saturday. (Storm VistaWxmodels.com) * Today’s record high is 102. With a 97-degree reading as of noon, a tie of this record is achievable. * Friday’s record high is 103. This one may be tough to get. * Saturday’s record high is 102. We have a decent chance at this one and there’s a very outside chance we could flirt with our all-time high temperature (any date) of 106 set in 1930 and 1918. * Sunday’s record is 100 - and while clouds may cool us down a bit relative to Saturday, we could make a run at this. NOAA’s Hydrometeorological Prediction Center predicts heat indices of near 110 Saturday near Washington, D.C. (NOAA) Humidity levels are going to remain moderate to high, adding 3-8 degrees to what the air temperature actually feels like - the heat index. Maxium heat indices through Sunday will be in the range of 100-107, except possibly near 107-112 on Saturday. The cause of the heat wave is a HUGE area of upper level high pressure - i.e. a heat dome - that has set all sorts of monthly and all-time records from the Rockies to the Southeast U.S. in the last one to two weeks. Wunderground’s Jeff Masters called the heat wave “one of the greatest in recorded history.” The heat wave has been amplified by drought - drying out soil moisture over large parts of the country. As of today, the U.S. Drought Monitor shows 56 percent of the country in drought - the largest area in its 12-year record. As of this morning, 56 percent of country was covered in drought and at least 76 percent abnormally dry. (U.S. Drought Monitor) Environmental factors intensifying the heat? A combination of the urban heat island effect (an increase in heat absorbing surfaces like asphalt and concrete) and climate warming from increasing greenhouse gases have also almost certainly intensified the heat to some degree - making records more likely now than in early decades. A cold front pushing through the region late Sunday into early Monday will bring a return to more normal mid-July temperatures early next week, with highs in the upper 80s and low humidity. Capital Weather Gang’s Ian Livingston contributed to this post.","completion":"Washington D.C. is experiencing a very hot heat wave, which means it's been very warm for many days in a row. This heat wave has tied the record for most days with temperatures of 95 degrees or higher. It might even get hotter over the weekend, possibly reaching 100 degrees or more! The heat wave is happening because of a big area of high pressure, which is a heat dome, and it has caused many record high temperatures across the United States. The heat is also made worse by things like lots of concrete and asphalt in cities, and changes in our environment.

Would \\"Transcellular fluid (a.k.a. \\"third space,\\" normally ignored in calculations)\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"When discussing the composition of the human body, water accounts for a significant portion, with percentages varying depending on factors like age, gender, and the individual's overall health and hydration levels. On average, it can be said that the human body is made up of around 60% water. However, to thoroughly address your question, it is necessary to explore the different types of fluid compartments found in the human body and evaluate whether \\"Transcellular fluid\\" would be a reasonable answer. The human body has several fluid compartments: 1. Intracellular fluid (ICF): This is the fluid contained within the cells and accounts for approximately 60% of the total body water content or 40% of the total body weight. The ICF is vital for the normal functioning and maintenance of cellular processes. 2. Extracellular fluid (ECF): This fluid exists outside the cells and accounts for approximately 40% of the total body water content or 20% of the total body weight. The ECF can be further divided into: a. Interstitial fluid: Fluid found in the spaces between cells and tissues. It accounts for around 75% of the ECF or 15% of the total body weight. b. Plasma: The fluid portion of blood, which accounts for around 20-25% of the ECF or 5% of the total body weight. 3. Transcellular fluid (a.k.a. \\"third space\\"): This fluid is separated from other fluid compartments by cellular barriers and is not readily accessible or exchangeable. It is typically found in body cavities such as the cerebrospinal, pericardial, pleural, peritoneal, ocular, and joint spaces. Transcellular fluid accounts for a relatively small portion of the total body water, often less than 2.5% of total body weight. Given the relatively small contribution of the transcellular fluid to the overall water composition of the human body, it cannot be considered a reasonable answer to the question, \\"how much water is the human body made of?\\" Instead, a more accurate approach would be to consider the combined contributions of intracellular, interstitial, and plasma fluids to determine a more comprehensive percentage, which as I mentioned earlier, is generally around 60%.

Given the following passage \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F.

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more.

Would crop A have lower or higher yields than crop B? Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. A:","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, crop A would have higher yields than crop B. Dan successfully developed crop A to be herbicide tolerant, meaning it can withstand the effects of herbicides while still growing. Crop B, on the other hand, is not tolerant to herbicides, and these chemicals may harm the crops when used for weed management. Weeds can compete with crops for essential resources like water and nutrients, which can negatively impact their growth and yields. Herbicides are commonly used by farmers to control the spread of weeds; however, the lack of cost-effective herbicides that do not harm crops is a significant challenge in weed management. The introduction of herbicide-tolerant crops, such as crop A, has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, leading to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. In turn, this would result in higher crop yields in comparison to crops that are not tolerant to herbicides, like crop B. Ultimately, crop A's herbicide tolerance allows it to grow without being negatively affected by weed-controlling chemicals, leading to a higher yield in comparison to crop B, which might suffer from the use of herbicides and decrease its overall yield. So, crop A would have higher yields than crop B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Context: Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose \\"territory\\" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as \\"meetings\\" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \\"family worship\\". Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a \\"circuit\\" gather for a one-day assembly.

Available options: I. Something smart II. Something silly III. not enough information IV. Something stupid In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... According to the above context, answer the following question.

Two ‘thrill seeking’ men who were racing their high performance cars at 80mph to see who had the fastest vehicle have been jailed for four years after causing the death of a cyclist. Mohammed Khan, 25, was at the wheel of a blue Audi RS3 in Bradford, West Yorkshire, at 1.45am on September 16, 2011, when he struck cyclist Vitalijs Rozenbergs, hurling him into the air and killing him almost immediately. Shajah Rehman, 31, was driving a black Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG in the outside lane, almost alongside the Audi, as the pair raced to see whose car was the quickest, Bradford Crown Court was told. Jailed: Mohammed Khan has been jailed for four years after killing cyclist Vitalijs Rozenbergs. He was racing friend Shajah Rehman in a high performance Audi RS3 in Bradford when he struck Mr Rozenbergs. Flee: Shajah Rehman did not stop following the accident but handed himself into the police the next day. Mr Rozenbergs, 22, a Latvian national who lived in Bradford, was cycling across the road on his way to Leeds for a night shift. The court heard there were no lights on his cycle and he was wearing headphones but the bike had a reflector and the road was well lit. Khan and Rehman, both pleaded guilty to causing the death of Mr Rozenbergs by dangerous driving. Khan also admitted causing death while driving uninsured. Prosecutor Richard Clews told the court on Monday that the defendants were racing at about 80mph, twice the legal speed limit. Khan’s Audi struck Mr Rozenbergs, throwing him 15 metres along the road, and causing him fatal injuries. The Audi collided with the Mercedes, as it tried to avoid a crash, and the Mercedes hit the central reservation. Khan stopped at the scene and waited for the emergency services to arrive. Rehman kept going but handed himself into the police the next day. Mr Clews said CCTV images showed the powerful cars almost side by side at high speed at the time of the impact. Khan had driven 223 miles to Bradford from Cardiff shortly before the crash at speeds averaging 85mph. He mistakenly believed he was insured to drive the Audi on a motor traders’ policy. The two men were jailed for four years today at Bradford Crown Court. In mitigation Khan’s barrister, Yunus Valli, said his client was deeply affected by what he described as a 'mindless death'. He came from a respected family and was genuinely and sincerely remorseful. Andrew Dallas, for Rehman, said he too was very sorry and his mental health had suffered. It was 'a few moments of dangerous stupidity', said Mr Dallas. Rehman had been driving for ten years with a clean licence. Judge Peter Benson said: 'Racing is a seriously aggravating feature of this type of offence.' He banned Khan and Rehman from driving for four years. After the case, Sergeant Garry Alderson, of the Major Collision Enquiry Team at West Yorkshire Police, said: 'For a few moments of thrill seeking, these two men have found themselves with a lifetime of regret, alongside a significant custodial sentence. 'Racing on West Yorkshire’s roads is extremely dangerous and will not be tolerated. The consequences of which can end lives and ruin many more, as we have witnessed in this particular case.' 'We will notice the temperature dropping over the next few days and there is a chance of snow on the high ground in the north of the country on Thursday,\\" said Helen Chivers, of the Met Office. 'From next week temperatures will be around 5C and there will be a chance of frost at night, when temperatures could fall to minus 5C in the countryside.'

Following their season sweep over the Raiders, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night match-up with their AFC West rival, the San Diego Chargers. With first place in the division on the line, both sides would play tough. In the first quarter, the Chargers got the only score of the period as LaDainian Tomlinson scored on a 3-yard TD run on a 98-yard drive. In the second quarter, the Broncos took the lead with RB Mike Bell getting two 3-yard TD runs. In the third quarter, kicker Jason Elam completed a 42-yard field goal, while CB Darrent Williams returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown. However, things started getting grim as Tomlinson (who historically had difficulty against the Broncos in Denver) exploded with a 3-yard TD run and a 51-yard touchdown reception. In the fourth quarter, Elam would get a 38-yard field goal, but San Diego managed to wrap up the game with QB Philip Rivers completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson and Tomlinson getting a 1-yard TD run. With the loss, the Broncos fell to 7-3 and second place in the AFC West. It would later be learned that safety Nick Ferguson had season-ending surgery to repair a torn medial meniscus in his left knee. He injured his knee after a 1st quarter interception.

[+] yes.","completion":"[+] no. These two questions inquire about different information. Let's analyze each question to understand their individual context and meaning. 1. Are Trump children examples of the “Rich Kids of Instagram”, with little sense of life challenges of average Americans? This question is asking whether the children of former US President Donald Trump, specifically referencing Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump, and Barron Trump, can be considered as part of the \\"Rich Kids of Instagram\\" – a term popularly used to describe individuals who flaunt their extravagant lifestyle on Instagram, often with little understanding or concern about the everyday struggles faced by average citizens. The question implies that these individuals may have grown up in a privileged environment that has shielded them from the challenges faced by regular Americans, such as financial hardships, job instability, or access to resources. 2. My stepdad let me have Facebook, but my mother wouldn't approve? This question is related to a personal situation where an individual's stepdad has allowed them to use Facebook – a social media platform – but they believe their mother would not be pleased with this decision. The context of this question is centered around family dynamics and the different perspectives of parental figures on the use of social media, particularly Facebook. As we can see, the two questions are distinct from one another and focus on different subjects. The first question discusses the lifestyle of Trump's children and their understanding of common American life challenges, whereas the second question inquires about a personal situation related to the conflicting opinions of parental figures about using social media."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Whether shadow-boxing or using a speed bag or heavy bag, new boxers must concentrate on using proper form when unleashing a blow. Using proper form means that you’ll need to develop a good sense of balance so that you’re not thrown off balance by throwing a punch. Also, practice keeping your hands in front of your face and returning to this defensive position after throwing a punch. Before punching, keep your hands close to your face and your elbows tight against your body. Put your weight into the punches you throw, and follow through with each punch. This will help you land punches effectively and accurately on your opponent’s head or torso. at your opponent to keep them at a distance. Jabbing is a basic punch which you’ll usually do with your weaker front hand. The jab is a short punch. To jab, drive your fist straight into your opponent’s face or torso. To maximize the effectiveness of the jab, professional boxers twist their arm and wrist just before making contact with their opponent. As opposed to a jab, which is thrown straight in front of the body, deliver a cross punch by jabbing your dominant hand in a slightly upward motion across your body. If your opponent throws a left jab at you, they’ll leave themself open for your right hook. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet, and aim your punch across your body towards the right side of your opponent’s torso or face. Use the cross on its own to counter a jab, or put the jab and cross together for a 1-2 combo. The shoulder helps power the cross punch. Also pay attention to your feet when throwing a cross. As you throw the punch, move your body weight from your rear foot up to your front foot. The hook can be delivered to the head or body of the opponent. Lean your body to the side that you plan to hit from, and circle your arm around to punch the opponent in the unprotected side of their head or body. The hook is often used in combination with other punches. The hook’s sweeping delivery is its chief drawback, as it can leave you susceptible to a counterpunch. So, if you and your opponent are exchanging swift jabs back and forth, this isn’t the time to wind up for a hook. The uppercut is an upward blow unleashed by either hand that is highly effective when in close quarters. Throw an uppercut when you’re close to your opponent’s body. To uppercut, lower your arm to about waist-height, then swing it upward in an explosive burst. Aim to his your opponent squarely on their chin. Don’t try to throw an uppercut form more than 1 foot (0.30 m) away, or you may miss and leave yourself open to a counter-attack to your body. After they become adept at delivering a variety of punches, fighters usually develop combinations, in which they release a devastating flurry of blows on their opponent. The first combination most boxers learn is the 1-2 combo (a jab followed by a cross). Try putting together different combos of your own. Rely on building combos around punches that you feel good throwing. Another effective combo adds a hook to the 1-2 combo. If you're right-handed, this would be a left jab followed by a right cross and ending with a left hook.","completion":"The article provides a comprehensive guide for new boxers on using proper form, maintaining balance, and executing different types of punches effectively, such as jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts, while emphasizing the importance of defensive positioning, punch combinations, and avoiding counter-attacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One failed venture was a 2002 men's lifestyle magazine called Gene Simmons' Tongue that lasted five issues. After this interview was published, Simmons issued this statement: I want to make this statement about my views on depression for the record and to clarify my prior remarks. To the extent my comments reported by the media speak of depression, I was wrong and in the spur of the moment made remarks that in hindsight were made without regard for those who truly suffer the struggles of depression. I sincerely apologize to those who were offended by my comments. I recognize that depression is very serious and very sad when it happens to anyone, especially loved ones. I deeply support and am empathetic to anyone suffering from any disease, especially depression. I have never sugarcoated my feelings regarding drug use and alcoholics. Somewhere along the line, my intention of speaking in very directly and perhaps politically incorrectly about drug use and alcoholics has been misconstrued as vile commentary on depression. Unkind statements about depression was certainly never my intention. Fully, you will know that and I do not intend to defend myself here and now, by listing the myriad charities and self-help organizations I am involved with. Rather, I simply want to be clear that my heart goes out to anyone suffering from depression and I deeply regret any offhand remarks in the heat of an interview that might have suggested otherwise. : Now you have your own arena football team and a reality show about it. Are you a fan of football?: No, I'm a fan of America and all things American deserve to be done as spectacle.We wanted to take the point of view with LA Kiss, first and foremost, let's not assume that they're football fans or even sports fans. Let's give them the best football possible - competitive and good-looking - all this kind of stuff, but when the ball's not in play, give 'em something.: You're doing this while being out on tour.: Tomorrow we're in Austin. Two days ago we were in Phoenix — 112 degree temperature, plus 85 percent humidity, plus another 10 to 20 degrees of stage lights. And fireballs going off.: Plus your costume of leather and metal...: Fifty pounds.: Why do you keep doing this?: It's not easy, but on the other hand, you know when you go to the gym there's a guy in the corner who's not looking over his shoulder, he's just really working it. You look with admiration at the commitment, because he's doing it for himself.I have enough money and enough fame. If you have enough money why would you get on stage with over 100 degree temperatures and 100 degree humidity? Pride.: And that's why the band still tours?: Yeah, we always get paid handsomely and that's appreciated. More is a good word.: Hey, I went to your farewell about a decade ago.: There will be plenty of farewell tours to come. Every time a band goes off stage and says good night, they come back, don't they?: So was it always a ruse?: No. We got off stage thinking: \\"That's it!\\" And people keep saying, \\"How come you don't come back?\\" Well, we no longer have Ace [Frehley] and Peter [Criss], and we already did the farewell tour with them. And they're going, \\"We don't care, we just want to see Kiss.\\": Did being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame play into that pride, or did you even care?: Personally I did not care, because the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has become a sham. Back room politics. There are disco artists and rap artists in that. So I will give the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame credibility even though it's got Run-D.M.C. and Madonna and some other people on it, as soon as the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame allows Led Zeppelin inside. You'd say, that's ridiculous. Oh really? But Run-D.M.C. is in the Rock Hall? What brand of guitar do you play? What song have you ever sung?: There have been some acts inducted who didn't attend the event at all. Why did you?: Because of the fans. It was important to validate, for them. And we said we'd play if you honor all of our members as you honored the Grateful Dead — all 10 members and the lyricist who is not in the band — in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The E Street Band are in in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I can't name you anybody who is in that; you know Bruce Springsteen.And they wouldn't allow [current members] Tommy [Thayer] and Eric [Singer] to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, who have been in the band longer than the originals.So we said OK, we'll accept the award, but I'm not playing. So I'll tell you what I'm going to do: I have a hall of fame, and I'm going to honor you. You can bring your whole family and everything else. But just your first girlfriend that you went out with. Your wife and your kids, no, they can't come. How would you feel about that?: Do you still get along with the original guys?: No, I don't get along with anybody who's a drug addict and has a dark cloud over their head and sees themselves as a victim. Drug addicts and alcoholics are always: \\"The world is a harsh place.\\" My mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. I don't want to hear fuck all about \\"the world as a harsh place.\\" She gets up every day, smells the roses and loves life. And for a putz, 20-year-old kid to say, \\"I'm depressed, I live in Seattle.\\" Fuck you, then kill yourself.I never understand, because I always call them on their bluff. I'm the guy who says 'Jump!' when there's a guy on top of a building who says, \\"That's it, I can't take it anymore, I'm going to jump.\\"Are you kidding? Why are you announcing it? Shut the fuck up, have some dignity and jump! You've got the crowd.By the way, you walk up to the same guy on a ledge who threatens to jump and put a gun to his head, \\"I'm going to blow your fuckin' head off!\\" He'll go, \\"Please don't!\\" It's true. He's not that insane.: Are you guys recording anything new?: We have new songs, but no plans to record right now. It's a long tour.: Is there any possibility of seeing yourself beyond Kiss, or retiring?: There are so many other ventures: film companies, TV, lots of stuff. Restaurant chains.: Does being the Demon ever get old for you? Putting on all that makeup? Spitting blood?: No. Ask Superman if he ever gets tired of the costume. No. Are you kidding?: The band is famous for all of its merchandising.: Kiss condoms, Kiss Kaskets: We get you coming and we get you going.: Some bands say they'd never be that commercial.: They're liars and I'll prove it to you: The hippiest of hippie bands has T-shirts, and as soon as you sell a ticket, you're not really selling music. As soon as you sell anything, you're selling something other than music.And by the way, I don't want to see a U2 comic book. I don't want to see The Edge with a cape flying through the air. But I want to see that with Kiss.So maybe the great bands - Radiohead, and U2 and The Stones - maybe they don't want to do it. But the truth is, they can't. Other than the Stones' tongue logo , when was the last time you saw anybody wearing Mick Jagger on their T-shirt. How about never?That doesn't mean they're not one of the best bands in the world, and they can't fill up a stadium. I'm talking about that iconic imagery: Things that stand the test of time across generations. I don't kid myself. It often sounds self-serving, delusional or in other ways arrogant. No. It's the truth.: It seems like you guys were fully formed from the beginning. There was no tinkering with your image.: No, it was all fully formed. And there were no managers in the beginning. It was an epiphany, a singularity: Four knuckleheads off the streets of New York got together and decided to form a band they never saw on stage. Once you throw the rulebook down on the floor, a lot of cool things are possible.Rock and roll, but he way, started that. Take the rule books:I can't; nor can Lennon or McCartney, Hendrix or anybody else - throw that away.I don't. No.When you take a look at the vast majority of bands, especially the ones that came out of the '60s and '70s, it defies logic how many variations there are of this thing called rock, soul, pop; from Motown to Elvis to The Beatles to Yes to Kiss, to ZZ Top, all this stuff. And they seem to have their own personality as opposed to rap, which looks like everybody came from a rap mother and rap father. There's no difference. And for a long time, country was like that. If you were a country artist, you put on your cowboy hat. It was a costume. Interesting isn't it? But only rock continues to be the iconic reference point.Bill Clinton is a rock star. Bill Clinton, if you said he was a hip-hop star or country western star, would mean nothing. If a fighter pilot is going to drop bombs, he says to his guys, \\"Let's rock!\\" or \\"Let's rock 'n' roll!\\" He doesn't say, \\"Let's hip-hop!\\" \\"Let's rap!\\": You seem to have a thing about hip-hop.: I don't have a thing about it at all. Whatever people want. But there used to be something called spoken word records. That's what they are. People are talking. Which is fine.: A lot of major bands have opened for you over the years.: The biggest bands. AC/DC, Bon Jovi, Judas Priest , Iron Maiden, Rush, Cheap Trick — the biggest bands all did their first tours opening for us because we picked them. 'Cause we're also fans.: You mentioned Radiohead earlier. Do you have other favorite contemporary bands?: I think Muse is the most interesting band to come out in 10 years.I think Lady Gaga is the only new rock star, although she's not a rocker. I would like her to throw away all the disco stuff and get a band. Don't use tapes, come out with a real live band and guitars. She's a bona fide musical artist. She did a duet with Tony Bennett, real great pipes. She can sit at a piano all by herself. She's a legitimate artist. A lot of the other pop divas who are really talented are not artists.: How about a Gaga collaboration with Kiss?: We tried, on our last record. And we got close. She got busy, we got busy. We would have done it.: Has the band ever done any collaboration projects like that?: Never.: That's what I'm thinking. Why is that?: When I was a kid, you didn't have to be a Beatle fan to be in awe of them, but I was. I didn't want any other band to get near The Beatles. Too pure. They looked like they came from the same Beatle mother. They looked like brothers or something.With The Stones it was easier. They had a blonde guy and things, so they often brought up people: Howlin' Wolf, somebody else.I didn't want to see anybody with The Beatles, or with Led Zeppelin, I didn't want them to jam with anybody. Look, it's all personal taste. AC/DC is one of the great bands. I don't want to see anybody jam with them. I just want to see AC/DC. ||||| Gene Simmons has made a career from spouting all manner of wild stuff from his mouth. This time he’s apparently launched a vitriolic attack on folks with mental health problems, urging them “have some dignity and jump”. And it’s not going down well. The veteran rocker’s latest brush with controversy comes in a Q&A; published by SongFacts. It’s a lively interview which touches on many bases, and largely digs into the status of Simmons’ rock band Kiss. The question was posed, “Do you still get along with the original guys?” To which Simmons answers, “No, I don't get along with anybody who's a drug addict and has a dark cloud over their head and sees themselves as a victim. Drug addicts and alcoholics are always: 'The world is a harsh place.' My mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. I don't want to hear fuck all about 'the world as a harsh place.' She gets up every day, smells the roses and loves life. And for a putz, 20-year-old kid to say, 'I'm depressed, I live in Seattle.' Fuck you, then kill yourself.” Kiss' Gene Simmons: 'I'm On the Side of Donald Sterling' He continues, “I never understand, because I always call them on their bluff. I'm the guy who says 'Jump!' when there's a guy on top of a building who says, 'That's it, I can't take it anymore, I'm going to jump.' Are you kidding? Why are you announcing it? Shut the fuck up, have some dignity and jump! You've got the crowd. By the way, you walk up to the same guy on a ledge who threatens to jump and put a gun to his head, 'I'm going to blow your fuckin' head off!' He'll go, 'Please don't!' It's true. He's not that insane.” Simmons, the bass-playing self-styled God of Thunder, was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year with the members of Kiss. Generations of fans have thrilled at the sight of his on-stage persona spitting blood and fire, and dangling his impossibly long, pointy tongue. The timing of Simmons’ published comments, however, is particularly insensitive coming as they do just days after the suicide of comic great Robin Williams. Williams had battled with depression, and drug addiction (Simmons paid his respects to the actor with an Aug. 12 tweet that read: \\"R.I.P. Robin Williams. A kind and generous man\\"). Nikki Sixx, the bass player with Motley Crue, called out Simmons on his Sixx Sense radio show. “Gene is basically saying he has no sympathy for drug addicts or people who are depressed,” he says. “I’m a recovering drug addict. If I had done what Gene Simmons said and that is to jump, so many wonderful things would have not happened in my life. We’ve just lost Robin Williams. He dealt with drug addiction and mainly depression. When I was young, I was depressed, drugs helped me suppress that. I came from a messed up situation not unlike a lot of people. There’s almost 15 million American that are depressed. Gene Simmons says I should have just killed myself…15 million people should just kill themselves?\\" Simmons is “pretty moronic” he adds. “To be honest with you, I like Gene, but in this situation, I don’t like Gene. I don’t like Gene’s words, because … there is a 20-year-old kid out there who is a Kiss fan and reads this and goes, ‘You know what? He’s right. I should just kill myself’.” Gene Simmons Turns to Fans for Kiss' 40th Anniversary Plans Sixx, who chronicled his own troubles with addiction in the 2001 book The Dirt and 2007's Heroin Diaries, tells his listeners that he sought therapy, and for a while took Prozac, to help overcome his issues. “For people who are depressed there is a way out. There are many, many ways out. I don’t want people to listen to an interview from a rock star, who’s telling you the only way out is out.” He continues, “All bad things will pass. Keep that in the back of your mind if you are feeling depression and don’t listen to [someone] who doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” ||||| Video Image WSJ Exclusive: '4th and Loud' TV Clip 1:17 Play video Watch a clip from AMC's forthcoming reality series 4th and Loud, which follows KISS rockers Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley as they launch a new Arena Football League team, L.A. Kiss. KISS rocker Gene Simmons has built a career on controversial antics, but has he gone too far this time? In a recent interview with journalist Roger Catlin on Songfacts.com, Simmons made some extreme comments regarding suicide and depression that now threaten to have long-term effects on his band’s career. Asked whether he still keeps in touch with original KISS members who left the band over the years, Simmons launched into a shocking tirade: “No, I don’t get along with anybody who’s a drug addict and has a dark cloud over their head and sees themselves as a victim. Drug addicts and alcoholics are always: ‘The world is a harsh place.’ My mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. I don’t want to hear f**k all about ‘the world as a harsh place.’ She gets up every day, smells the roses and loves life. And for a putz, 20-year-old kid to say, ‘I’m depressed, I live in Seattle.” F**k you, then kill yourself,” Simmons said. It didn’t end there. “I always call them on their bluff. I’m the guy who says ‘Jump!’ when there’s a guy on top of a building who says, ‘That’s it, I can’t take it anymore, I’m going to jump.’ Are you kidding? Why are you announcing it? Shut the f**k up, have some dignity and jump! You’ve got the crowd,” he said. Simmons’ comments have drawn condemnation from other legendary rockers. Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx yesterday denounced Simmons on his radio show, Sixx Sense. “It’s pretty moronic because [Simmons] thinks everybody listens to him, that he is the God of Thunder. He will tell you he is the greatest man on earth, and to be honest with you, I like Gene. But in this situation, I don’t like Gene. I don’t like Gene’s words,” Sixx said. “There is a 20-year-old kid out there who is a Kiss fan and reads this and goes, ‘You know what? He’s right. I should just kill myself.’” The backlash has reached all the way to Australia, with Triple M today announcing they would remove all KISS songs from their playlists nationwide. In a statement published on the Triple M website, network head Mike Fitzpatrick labelled Simmons’ comments “misguided and insensitive.” “Depression and suicide are not topics he should be using to further his notoriety or sell records. His desperation to use mental health issues to find relevancy in a modern age is sickening. I can only put it down to a brain fade on his part. The Triple M Network can’t and won’t be playing or supporting this d***head’s music. I put the challenge out to other stations across Australia and North America to also drop any of this nudnik’s songs until such time as he reconsiders his thoughtless and insensitive position.” Simmons comments were published on the Songfacts website on July 31, and it appears that, in the wake of actor Robin Williams’ tragic suicide this week, the KISS bassist may already have softened his views on those dealing with depression: R.I.P. Robin Williams. A kind and generous man. — Gene Simmons (@genesimmons) August 11, 2014 Simmons also retweeted the following (US based) information for those struggling with depression following Williams’ death: If you, or someone you know needs help, please contact Lifeline on 13 11 14. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article is about a famous rock band called Kiss.

Question: AT WHOOSE BIRTHDAY BUHER HIMSELF TO DAMIEN? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Damien: Omen II Context: Jerusalem, Israel. One week after the burial of Robert and Katherine Thorn (in the first Omen movie), archeologist Carl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern) asks his friend Michael Morgan (Ian Hendry) to deliver a box to the guardian of Thorn's young son, Damien. He reveals that Damien is the Antichrist and that the box contains a warning and the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to the ruin of Yigael's wall, showing him an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face. Morgan is convinced, but the two are buried alive as a tunnel collapses.Seven years later, 12-year old Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is living with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his wife, Ann (Lee Grant) at a large house outside of Chicago, Illinois. He gets along well with his 15-year-old cousin Mark (Lucas Donat), Richard's son, with whom he is enrolled in a military academy. However, he is despised by Aunt Marion (Sylvia Sidney), who favors Mark and thinks Damien a bad influence, even threatening to cut Richard out of her will if he does not separate the two boys. The same night, the appearance of a raven wakes her up and causes a fatal heart attack.Through a friend, Dr. Charles Warren (Nicholas Pryor), who is the curator of the Thorn Museum, Richard is introduced to journalist Joan Hart (Elizabeth Shephard), who was a colleague of Keith Jennings (from the previous film). Having seen Yigael's Wall and drawing a link to all the deaths that surrounded Damien, including Jennings', Joan tries to warn Richard but he throws her out of his limo. After a confrontation with Warren and Ann Thorn at the Thorn Museum, Joan became unsure on whether Damien's face matches the painting on Yigael's Wall. Joan goes to meet Damien at his school, but when she sees his face she drives off in panic. On the road, her car mysteriously dies down. When she gets out of the car, she is attacked by a raven, which pecks her eyes out, causing her to be run over by a passing truck.A few months later at Thorn...","completion":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Outside, fellow patrolman Dorian Fletcher (Beach) shoots a man running towards him, only to discover that he was unarmed. While Fletcher is distraught by the incident, Peck plants a knife on the body to get Fletcher off the hook. Soon afterwards, Raymond Avila (Garcia) joins the LAPD's Internal Affairs Division (IAD) and is assigned to investigate the drug bust with partner Amy Wallace (Metcalf). The investigation reveals that Stretch abuses drugs, has a history of excessive force, and may be corrupt. Avila eventually begins to look into Peck, who is held up as a role model for the LAPD but is regarded with distaste by other officers over his brutal techniques. Avila unsuccessfully pressures Stretch to provide evidence against Peck in return for immunity from prosecution. Fletcher, who has gotten into an altercation with Peck, agrees to help Avila's investigation. Avila's marriage starts to wilt due to his increased obsession with the case, and Peck insinuates he will make advances on Raymond's wife, Kathleen.

Context: The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who tries to get information from the paleontologist?, using the article: In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men., what would be the answer ?

Can they or can't they? Almost certainly, a machine can do any work in thinking that a person can do--if the correct way for doing the thinking work can be told exactly. Besides, many programs have been made to direct machines so that they work in very clever ways. Machines have been taught to play chess and to learn from what happens in the games so as to make their play better and better. Machines can beat many persons who play chess. Machines can translate from one language to another. They can prove statements in geometry as taught in school. Machines can notice printed marks on paper, so that a person is no longer needed to look at the marks. Computers can be used in many ways, such as business, science, industry, and government. _ If people cannot tell exactly the correct way to do certain work in thinking, it is still a question how much of _ a machine can do. Suppose a person is \\"teaching\\" the machine and telling the machine \\"yes\\" when the machine is right, and \\"no\\" when the machine is wrong. Then the machine can keep on searching among possible ways for solving a problem--until the machine can do as well as the person, and perhaps much better. But, what is thinking? People can agree about much that is thinking, and much that is not thinking; but they can't reach agreement because the word \\"think\\" is not a scientific word with an exact meaning. A lot of the discussion is wasted breath because the persons are using different meanings of the word \\"think\\". People, however, have only had experience with machines that appear to think since 1944. It would be too early to say that after the next 200 years, machines will not be thinking. And to consider that machines can think gives people a big push to give to machines more and more work in thinking. Which probably is the best title for the passage? A) What Is Thinking?

Her eyes scanned the area, noting every possible hiding spot and strategizing on how to flush them out. \\"Alright, listen up,\\" she ordered her team. \\"Spread out and search the area thoroughly.

As they searched, a mixture of tension and determination filled the air. However, none of them was aware that the intruders had, in fact, managed to overhear the entire conversation. Hiding in a concealed alcove behind a stack of storage crates, the two intruders, James and Elise, knew they were running out of time. They couldn't afford to be caught, not with the information they had gone to such lengths to obtain. James glanced over at Elise, who was nervously clutching the flash drive that held the coveted data. \\"Don't worry,\\" he whispered, attempting to reassure her. \\"We've already gone this far, and I'm not about to let us get caught now. Besides, with the great fashion sense we've got, we might be able to blend in with the crowd and slip out unnoticed.\\" He grinned, gesturing to their well-made, functional, and stylish jeans, worn with protective padding hidden beneath to mitigate any injuries from their daring escape.

Once both were disguised, James cautiously peeked around the corner of the storage crates, timing their escape to perfection. As soon as the coast was clear, they slipped out of their hiding spot, blending in with the other guards as they made their way to the nearest exit. While their hearts raced and their nerves threatened to betray them, they managed to remain composed, knowing that their lives and the lives of countless others depended on their mission's success.

James nodded in agreement, maintaining his composure as he held the door open for her. \\"Take a step for our freedom,\\" he whispered, alluding to their previous dramatic exchange. \\"And remember, we protected the trousers too.\\" With a shared grin and a newfound sense of hope, they walked out of the door, their hearts pounding in tandem as they inched closer to freedom and the eventual revelation of the truth that the unsuspecting world so desperately needed to know."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that offered giving the Chicago Symphony Orchestra three and a half months? from the following article ? In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Summarize: Put your hive in an area that gets sun in the mornings. This ensures that your bees get out of their hive early to forage for pollen. Place the hive in a spot that gets the full sun if you live in cooler climates such as the northeastern United States. Put the hive in a place with afternoon shade if you live in warmer climates. Keep your hive away from open spots that are exposed to direct winds or breezes. Instead, set it next to wind breaks such as fences, shrubbery, trees, or bushes.

Here is an article: A quietly emerging trend in health care is likely to have a major effect on who will diagnose and treat your illness in the coming years. Rather than a physician, that comprehensive-care provider may very well be a nurse--who also happens to be a doctor. As more physicians move toward specialties and away from general care, there is a troubling lack of providers in this critical health-care sector. The need is even more urgent in light of the growing number of Americans who are suffering from chronic illnesses such as asthma, diabetes and hypertension and require long-term disease treatment and coordination of care. Many others who survive extraordinary medical interventions or trauma need sustaining care for the rest of their lives. The doctor of nursing practice (DNP) is a new level of clinical practice that is attracting a rapidly growing number of nursing professionals. This doctoral degree enables advanced-practice nurses to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to practice independently in every clinical setting. DNPs are the ideal candidates to fill the primary-care void and deliver a new, more comprehensive brand of care that starts with but goes well beyond conventional medical practice. In addition to expert diagnosis and treatment, DNP training places an emphasis on preventive care, risk reduction and promoting good health practices. These clinicians are peerless prevention specialists and coordinators of complex care. In other words, as a patient, you get the medical knowledge of a physician, with the added skills of a nursing professional. Truly comprehensive care requires both medical and nursing skills, and nurses with a clinical doctorate have that complement of abilities. Skilled at identifying nuanced changes of condition, and intervening early in a patient's illness, these clinicians are also expert at utilizing community and family resources, and incorporating patient values into a family-centered model of care. Once patients move beyond the common bias that only doctors of medicine can provide top-flight care, they typically come to appreciate these added benefits. Most important, research has demonstrated that DNPs, with their eight years of education and extensive clinical experience, can achieve clinical outcomes comparable to those of primary-care physicians. As more advanced-practice nurses pursue this new level of clinical training, we are working to create a board certification to establish a consistent standard of competence. To that end, we are working to enable DNPs to take standardized exams similar in content and format to the test that physicians must pass to earn their M.D. degrees. By allowing DNPs to take this test, the medical establishment will give patients definitive evidence that these skilled clinicians have the ability to provide comprehensive care indistinguishable from physicians. Along with a doctorate and the title of \\"doctor,\\" the fact that a nurse practitioner has fulfilled this certification requirement will instill confidence in patients that DNPs have the expertise to serve as their health-care provider of choice. Nurse practitioners are reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid in every state, but only variably by commercial insurance carriers. That is certain to change soon, as these DNP graduates prove they are the logical choice to become the new comprehensive-care clinicians. As this valuable new resource grows and becomes fully established, the health-care system's ability to meet the nation's desire for accessible, high-quality care will be greatly improved, yielding better health for all. Medical specialists are in short supply; patients increasingly need their care. With the advent of the DNP clinicians, we can have both dedicated, brilliant specialists and effective health management. It is the future we all need and want. Mary O' Neil Mundinger, Dr.P.H., is the Dean of the Columbia University School of Nursing, which was the first to pioneer the DNP concept.

Article: The Bronte sisters were three sisters who became famous novelists. Their lives and works are connected with the lonely moors of Yorkshire, England, where they lived. Patrick Bronte, the sisters' father, was a poor Irishman who became the parish clergyman of the small, isolated town of Haworth, Yorkshire. Bronte was somewhat strange and tended to be strict. His wife died in 1821 and her sister brought up the family out of duty, but with little love or understanding. The sisters went to several boarding schools where they received a better education than usual for girls at that time, but in a bad atmosphere. Few jobs were available for women at that time, and the Bronte sisters, except for occasional jobs as governesses or schoolteachers, lived their entire lives at home. They were shy, poor, and lonely, and occupied themselves with music, drawing, reading and ---above all---writing. Their isolation led to the early development of their imaginations. In 1846, under the male pen names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, the sisters published a joint volume of poems.Although only two copies were sold, all three sisters soon had their first novels published. Charlotte Bronte's most famous novel Jane Eyre (1847) is largely _ . Through the heroine, Charlotte relived her hated boarding school life and her experiences as a governess in a large house. Rochester, the hero and master of the house, is fictional. Jane Eyre was enormously successful, but many readers were shocked that Rochester, who tried to make Jane his mistress, should be rewarded by marrying her. Some readers were also shocked because Jane wanted to be regarded as a thinking and independent person, rather than as a weak female. Charlotte Bronte wrote three other novels. The first one, The Professor, was not published until 1857, after her death. Shirley (1849) is set among the labour riots of the early 1800s. Villette (1853) the most popular of the three, is based on Charlotte's unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels.

Chesapeake accuses founder of stealing secrets to start a new firm Roughly two years after ousting Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake Energy is reportedly accusing its co-founder and former CEO of stealing sensitive company information on his way out the door. The Oklahoma City-based energy giant filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday alleging that, in 2013, McClendon spent his final days at the helm of Chesapeake hoarding company data on available land with potential for oil and gas mining, according to Reuters. Chesapeake CHK says McClendon had maps printed and also e-mailed himself information on open acreage in the Utica Shale formation, in Ohio, before putting that data to use for his next venture: founding rival company American Energy Partners. McClendon co-founded Chesapeake in 1989 and helped accelerate the company’s growth by adopting the now widely-used drilling method of hydraulic fracturing, also known as “fracking.” With McClendon at the helm, Chesapeake grew to become the country’s second-largest natural gas producer, behind only Exxon Mobil XOM . In 2008, Fortune profiled McClendon, noting Chesapeake’s ascent amid U.S. natural gas prices that were skyrocketing at the time, but have since come back down to earth. (Those declining natural gas prices left Chesapeake saddled with debt after its rapid expansion efforts, and the recent drop-off in oil prices has seen the company’s stock price fall nearly 17% over the past year.) However, McClendon agreed to step down from his CEO role in early 2013 after reports surfaced revealing he had borrowed more than 1 billion against his own stake in company oil wells. The reports raised questions about a possible conflict of interest, although a Chesapeake internal investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. McClendon was also under SEC investigation for the loans, much of which came from financial entities with investments in Chesapeake, but the government dropped its probe last year. Within a year of McClendon leaving Chesapeake, Reuters reports, an affiliate of McClendon’s American Energy Partners had raised 1.7 billion in equity and debt that the company said it would use to buy 110,000 acres in the Utica Shale formation and begin drilling. Chesapeake’s lawsuit accuses American Energy Partners of violating Oklahoma trade secrets laws and the company is asking a federal judge to create a trust to house all of the income McClendon’s current company has earned from Utica Shale drilling, which the lawsuit claims was earned as a result of stolen Chesapeake data. In a statement Tuesday, McClendon and American Energy Partners said they would “respond vigorously to a baseless legal action” brought by Chesapeake. Chesapeake promised McClendon he could have information on thousands of oil wells upon his departure from the company, the former CEO said in a press release. That release also says McClendon’s separation agreement with Chesapeake gave him the right to share that information with future employees and business partners. “It is beyond belief that the company that I co-founded 25 years ago and where I worked tirelessly to build it into one of America’s largest and most successful oil and gas producers has now decided to add insult to injury almost two years to the day after my resignation by wrongly accusing me of misappropriating information,” McClendon said in a statement. He added: “It is a sad day to see Chesapeake stoop so low as to sue its co-founder for having information that was earned, paid for and provided through my contracts with Chesapeake.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Chesapeake Energy, an energy company, is accusing Aubrey McClendon, its founder who left the company, of stealing secret information about land that might have oil and gas.

Yes, it is possible to spend too much time on Quora or any other social media platform or online community. Excessive usage can lead to various issues like time mismanagement, lack of focus on important tasks, and addiction to the platform. Accessibility, constant notifications, and engagement with the content could make it difficult for some people to control the time spent on Quora, eventually leading to an unhealthy relationship with the platform. Though Quora can be a great source of knowledge and expand one's understanding in various fields, it is important to realize when the usage becomes excessive and starts affecting personal and professional life. Question 2: Can spending too much time on Quora be unhealthy? Yes, spending too much time on Quora can be unhealthy, both mentally and physically. Like any other form of digital engagement, excessive use of Quora can cause various physical issues like eye strain, poor posture, and sleep disruptions. It could also lead to psychological consequences, such as increased anxiety, depression, and addiction to the platform. Excessive use of Quora may also result in unhealthy social comparisons as users tend to evaluate others' expertise and their own based on upvotes and followers. It could lead to a decline in productivity due to constant distractions from the flow of new information and discussions on the platform. Moreover, spending excessive time on Quora can impede offline social interactions, if most of the social needs are being met online. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? While questions 1 and 2 are related, they are not precisely asking the same thing. Question 1 is about the possibility of spending excessive time on Quora, which is an inquiry about the limits and consequences of using the platform. Question 2 is more focused on the potential detrimental effects of spending too much time on Quora and how it can be harmful to one's well-being. Although both questions address the negative aspects of excessive Quora usage, question 1 targets the possibility of overusing the platform, while question 2 asks about the potential unhealthy outcomes of spending excessive time on it."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is unaware that heavy snow has closed the Chicago landing field? from the following article ?

Allan David Bloom (September 14, 1930 - October 7, 1992) was an American philosopher, classicist, and academician. He studied under David Grene, Leo Strauss, Richard McKeon, and Alexandre Kojeve. He subsequently taught at Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Yale University, Ecole Normale Superieure of Paris, and the University of Chicago. Bloom championed the idea of Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, The Closing of the American Mind. Allan Bloom was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1930 to second-generation Jewish parents who were both social workers. The couple had a daughter, Lucille, two years earlier. As a thirteen-year-old, Bloom read a Readers Digest article about the University of Chicago and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes. Yet, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a psychiatrist and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago's humanities program for gifted students. In 1946, Bloom was accepted to the same program, starting his degree at the age of fifteen, and spending the next decade of his life enrolled at the University in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. This began his lifelong passion for the 'idea' of the university. In the preface to Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960-1990, he stated that his education \\"began with Freud and ended with Plato\\". The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery--an idea that Bloom would later write, seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits Leo Strauss as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him. Bloom graduated from the University of Chicago with his Bachelor's Degree at the age of 18. One of his college classmates was the classicist Seth Benardete. For post-graduate studies, he enrolled in the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, where he was assigned Classicist David Grene as tutor, and went on to write his thesis on Isocrates. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to studying classics, but with no definite career ambitions. The Committee was a unique interdisciplinary program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation. Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the Committee on Social Thought in 1955. He subsequently studied under the influential Hegelian philosopher Alexandre Kojeve in Paris, whose lectures Bloom would later introduce to the English-speaking world. While teaching philosophy at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, he befriended Raymond Aron, amongst many other philosophers. Among the American expatriate community in Paris his friends included leftist writer Susan Sontag.

Given the question: Given the below context: In an isolated villa on the small Italian island of Pantelleria, world-famous rock singer Marianne Lane is on holiday with her filmmaker lover Paul. She is recovering from surgery and has lost her voice, communicating only by signs and occasional whispers. He is in recovery from alcohol addiction and a suicide attempt. Neither speaks Italian but solitude is what both need, until an aeroplane from Rome brings a man neither wants to see. This is Harry, an extroverted music promoter who was Marianne's lover until he passed her on to his protegé, Paul. With him is Penelope, a previously unknown daughter of his who says she is 22. Moving into the villa, Harry starts inviting friends around as if it were his home and taking everybody out to various sights and festivities. His arrogant manner bores Pen and annoys Paul, but Marianne starts falling under his spell again; however, when Harry and Marianne begin to become intimate while alone, Marianne stops Harry. She tells him that she does love him, but that she cannot be with him and that she is with Paul. The sultry Pen then makes a play for the unhappy Paul; it is not shown, but implied, that Paul succumbs to Pen's overtures. Guess a valid title for it! The answer is:","completion":"A Silent Siren's Dilemma Step 1: Identify the key elements of the context. In this case, the key elements are the isolated villa, Marianne Lane (the singer who lost her voice), Paul (her filmmaker lover), Harry (the intrusive former lover of Marianne), and Penelope (Harry's daughter). Step 2: Focus on the main conflict or theme.

Compensatory vision therapy focuses on stimulating the brain area involved in vision. It includes training with prisms, scanning, and visual field awareness systems. The movement of images from a non-seeing site to a seeing-site helps adapt the visual field and the associated brain area, improving vision. The goal of restorative vision therapy is to stimulate the various neural connections involved in vision within brain. It includes many specific components for each type of vision impairment that occurs after stroke. It focuses particularly on the point of the eye which has the highest amount of neuronal connections. This therapy has the highest level of recovery potential. Prisms are used to correct different types of visual problems. The kind of prism and their placement may vary, depending upon the presenting signs and symptoms. For example: In the case of double vision, the prism is placed on a glass lens to realign the abnormal positioning of the eye's gaze. In the case of visual neglect, an individual with visual neglect on the left side of his visual field would use a prism that can mirror items on his left side, to the right side of his visual field. Low vision aids are designed to help the partially sighted population. They are divided into three categories, including optical aids (hand held magnifiers, stand magnifiers, telescopes), non optical aids (enlarged prints, high intensity lamps, high contrast objects, microfiche readers), and electronic low vision aids (closed circuit TV, opaque projectors, slide projection). All of these things can greatly help your vision. Some other aids are tactile visual aids, auditory vision, spelled speech, and direct stimulation of visual cortex. Surgery is usually not an option to solve post stroke related visual problems, since the cause is not a physical trauma to the eye. However, in some instances. surgery can be recommended to correct double vision. Eye muscle surgery is usually helpful for cases of double vision caused by the narrowing of the eyes. The procedure can help in re-positioning of the eyes. The decision to undergo surgery should be done with an extensive assessment of the benefits and the possible risks. Summary:","completion":"Compensatory vision therapy helps improve vision by training the brain and using special tools like prisms. Restorative vision therapy focuses on helping the brain's vision connections get better. Prisms help fix different eye problems, like double vision or trouble seeing things on one side. Low vision aids, like magnifiers and special lamps, can also help people see better.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt. How long should it take to hire a real estate agent? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - it should take some time to interview multiple agents before making a decision - not enough information - you should take a few months to review agent profiles online before moving forward - you should call the first person recommended and hire them the same day Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"it should take some time to interview multiple agents before making a decision.\\" Interviewing real estate agents before hiring one is a prudent step to take in the home buying or selling process, and should not be taken lightly or done hastily. Here's why: 1. **It ensures the agent's suitability**: Every real estate agent has different specialties, skills, and experience, which may or may not align with what you need. For example, some are more experienced in dealing with high-end properties, while others may specialize in particular neighborhoods. By interviewing different agents, you can find one who has the specific skills and knowledge required for your particular situation. 2. **Checks compatibility**: It's very important that you and your agent are on the same page. You need to be able to effectively communicate with each other and feel comfortable voicing your concerns. Interviewing prospective agents will give you an idea of their communication style, professionalism, and level of respect for your preferences. 3. **Avoids possible conflicts**: Sometimes an agent you’re thinking about hiring could potentially be a dual agent, i.e., they could represent both the buyer and the seller. While this is legal, it can lead to conflicts of interest. By interviewing them, you can discover whether this is the case and decide how you feel about it. 4. **Provides an opportunity to negotiate commission**: Naturally, agents want to make as much money as possible on the deal. However, there is always room for negotiation. If you don’t interview agents, you could be missing an opportunity to possibly reduce the commission percentage. 5. **Guarantees commitment**: Some realtors take on multiple clients, making it difficult for them to dedicate their full attention to each one. An interview will allow you to assess their workload and decide whether they can devote the necessary time and effort to your endeavor. In conclusion, it should take some time to interview multiple real estate agents before making a decision. The time you invest in this endeavor can potentially save time, effort, and resources down the line. Just like with any other important hiring decision, you want to make sure that you're choosing the person who's not only the most qualified but also the best fit for you and your needs."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: Knitting with a group of friends is a great way to do what?

Andy Kaufman: Why it’s time to celebrate the comic and bury the death hoax Thirty years after Andy Kaufman died too young of cancer — cutting short a brief, sensational career that changed the face of American comedy, and maybe even American irony — the old Andy Kaufman death-hoax theory is back. It’s new and improved for the Internet era, going viral now that the ragtag community of Andy Truthers has been joined by a credentialed ally, Kaufman’s longtime writing partner Bob Zmuda. In a new book co-authored by Kaufman’s girlfriend Lynne Margulies, Zmuda recalls years of conversations in which his friend outlined plans to exit show business by faking his own death. “He said to keep a lid on it for 30 years,” says Zmuda in a phone interview. “It’s 30 years now. . . . What I’m doing is sending a telegram to Andy: It’s time to come in from the cold.” Oh, please. Zmuda’s theory (“it’s not a theory!”) is so absurd, so off-putting we don’t mind telling him so. But Zmuda, 64, a man with a quick laugh and unstoppable line of banter, isn’t hurt. Call his ideas in “Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally,” preposterous, tasteless, hurtful to Kaufman’s family, a shameless money-grab whose tenuous logic is undercut by his own past statements and testimony in his own book — he’s got calm answers for all of this. The only thing that shocks him is that we’re shocked. “When he died,” Zmuda says (in one of several split-second slip-ups), “85 percent of the population believed he had faked his death.” He adds later: “Go back to 1984. No one could believe he was dead.” No one ever knew what to make of Andy Kaufman. In his 1975 “Saturday Night Live” debut, he stood on stage fidgeting silently as a children’s record played — until it came to the chorus, and then he would lip-sync Mighty Mouse’s one line (“Here I come to save the day!”) with a glorious swagger. \\"Mighty Mouse\\" - Andy Kaufman from Sabzian on Vimeo. There were oddball cameos on ’70s variety shows singing childish tunes in deadpan style, or rocking out while singing the same line (“I trusted you! I trusted you!”) over and over. In one routine, he did nothing more than sit on stage, order a bowl of ice cream, and consume it to the sound of a laugh track. At a Carnegie Hall show in 1979, he brought his grandmother on stage; then later unmasked her to reveal it was really Robin Williams; and then, he loaded the entire audience onto buses and took them out for milk and cookies. It was as much performance art as it was comedy, and in the years before Bill Murray made a career of being facetious or David Letterman needled starlets to the brink of tears or Sacha Baron Cohen went deep into character for his “Borat” hoaxes, no one else was doing anything like it. “If you look at him through the prism of comedy, he wasn’t a comedian,” says Zmuda. “He couldn’t tell a joke to save his life. He was a behavioral scientist. He was looking for people’s reaction.” And even as he gained mainstream sitcom success as Latka, the ambiguously foreign mechanic on “Taxi,” he looked for ways to push the envelope — and carry the joke off-stage. As a guest on the comedy show “Fridays” in 1981, he spectacularly blew his lines, and co-star Michael Richards (later Kramer of “Seinfeld” fame) stormed across the stage to throw cue cards at him. The on-camera brawl was a hoax, of course, but you maybe didn’t know that at the time. To balance the lovable Latka image, he adopted the alter-ego of Tony Clifton, a vulgar Vegas lounge singer. A reporter profiling Kaufman for The Washington Post in 1979 was among those fooled into thinking that Clifton was an actual person with whom Kaufman had inexplicably aligned himself — though in fairness, even folks who were in on the joke didn’t realize that it was sometimes Zmuda, not Kaufman, hiding under the Clifton costume. But it was Kaufman’s dabbling in professional wrestling that got audiences wondering: Is he for real? He challenged women to wrestle him, calling himself the “Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World.” He rigged up a trash-talking rivalry with Jerry “The King” Lawler and actually got in the ring with him — emerging later in a neck brace. On Letterman’s show, Kaufman taunted the pro, and Lawler slapped him out of his chair. Kaufman’s antics struck such a nerve with a baffled public that in a 1983 phone poll, “SNL” viewers voted him off the program. An outta-nowhere lung cancer struck the non-smoker. Fans were barely aware that he was sick before he passed away in Los Angeles on May 16, 1984, at age 35. On the heels of so many hoaxes, it’s likely some were hesitant to trust the obits. (“The cast of ‘Taxi’ didn’t even show up to his funeral,” says Zmuda, claiming they suspected a prank; news accounts indicate a letter from star Judd Hirsch was read at the service.) But there’s a death certificate and a burial site and everything — not to mention the family and friends at his side when he passed. Kaufman’s brother Michael has little patience for Zmuda or the lesser conspiracy theorists who have thrived on Web forums over the years. “What would motivate these people to invest so much time and energy in something like this?” he says over the phone. “They might be attention-hungry, or more likely in need of money. Who knows?” The family keeps the comic’s spirit alive in a more traditional way, sponsoring the Andy Kaufman Awards, a stand-up competition for “cutting-edge artists”; the 10th annual show will be held Sunday in New York. (Not that the family is insulated from the hoax scene: At last year’s event, Michael Kaufman took the stage with a woman claiming to be his late brother’s long-lost daughter; it wasn’t true, and Michael later said he was unwittingly caught up in a ruse.) “When Andy was alive, Bob would do a lot of crazy things, and Andy would have to apologize,” the brother explains. Zmuda’s book goes out of the way to settle ancient scores with his friend’s family; there’s clearly no love lost here. But Michael Kaufman declines to engage. “If Andy was to look down upon us now and see this book, he would shake his head and say, ‘Eh, I don’t want to stifle his creativity.’ ” So we’ll just have to get into the ring with Zmuda instead. “For two or three years before he died, he was telling people he was going to fake his death,” Zmuda says. “He called me up saying, ‘I want to know how to get a cadaver.’ He would fake a car accident. I said that wouldn’t work because they’d check dental records. . . . Then he started thinking about how he’d be lost at sea.” Zmuda founded the charity fundraiser Comic Relief and produced its specials, but much of his post-Andy career has been Andy-centric. He worked on “Man in the Moon,” the Kaufman biopic starring Jim Carrey. He also wrote a previous memoir, “Andy Kaufman Revealed!” in 1999. So . . . why not divulge Kaufman’s death hoax in that book? Out of respect for Kaufman’s father, who died just last year, says Zmuda. (And no, he insists, this isn’t about selling books: “There’s no money with a book like this. I hired a publicist. I’m flying to New York next week on my own dime.”) Now, how exactly did this hoax work? Zmuda thinks Kaufman found a fan who was actually dying of cancer, and then altered his own appearance to more closely resemble that man, ultimately swapping places. He admits he doesn’t know all the details. “When I realized he was going to do this for real, I informed him that it is illegal to fake his death,” Zmuda says. “I made it clear that I’m stepping out of it.” But if he was going to fake his death, why would he go around telling people? “Because Andy couldn’t keep his mouth shut!” But . . . his own co-author, Margulies, did see Kaufman die. (Her revelation in the book is that she believes her boyfriend was bisexual and actually succumbed to AIDS.) Zmuda admits this is a tricky one. But he notes that Margulies has a background in the theatrics of pro wrestling and knows a thing or two about long cons. “Lynne might be pulling one on me,” he confides. What if, assuming any of these conversations are real, the death hoax is the hoax? What if Kaufman, sensing that he might be gravely ill, decided to prank his friends — and maybe perpetuate his own legend — by floating this tantalizing idea, so that the notion he might be alive would linger after his death? His real, documented, too-early, unfair, terribly sad death. Zmuda shrugs this off: Nope, the cancer came up too fast, Kaufman would have had no idea he was sick a few years out. Wait — so he did have cancer? Mr. Zmuda, you’re just doing a bit of performance art here, aren’t you? “No,” he says flatly, “I’m not.” He spins a rosy fantasy of his friend’s grand return. Lawyers will iron out all the fraud issues; a promoter will pay 1 million just for Andy to walk on stage for a few minutes. There will be DNA testing, of course. It will be the showbiz comeback of the century. “In six months when he appears, you’ll see what I’m talking about,” Zmuda says. “I’m telling you, get on board now!” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article talks about the comedian Andy Kaufman who was known for his hoaxes and playing pranks, and his friend Bob Zmuda who has written a book about Andy.

Plot title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners. According to Siegal, all New Jersey counties can choose whether or not to allow their employees to pass on benefits to their partners.

The American Museum of Natural History, located in New York, is the institution where the authors worked. It is one of the largest and most prestigious museums in the world, with extensive collections and exhibits on various fields of natural history, including paleontology. The museum's paleontology department is renowned for its extensive fossil collection, its knowledge of the evolution of life on Earth, and its contributions to the field of study. Paleontology is a scientific discipline that studies the history of life on Earth through the analysis of fossils. These fossils provide researchers with valuable information about ancient organisms, their environment, and the evolutionary processes that have shaped life throughout the planet's history. Paleontologists are experts in this field, using their knowledge of biology, geology, and other sciences to reconstruct the past and understand the complex web of relationships between extinct and extant species. In this context, the two authors likely took part in various research projects and contributed to the scientific community through their work at the American Museum of Natural History. They would have had access to the extensive collections of the museum, its facilities, and a network of experts in various fields related to paleontology. By working at such an esteemed institution, the authors would have had the opportunity to collaborate with other experts, share their ideas, and develop a better understanding of the field. Therefore, not only does the sentence tell us where the authors worked together, but it also gives us insight into the academic environment they were a part of and the resources that may have been available to them.

Information: - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the United States Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the \\"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"CJCS\\"), \\"Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"VCJCS\\"), and the Military Service Chiefs from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, all appointed by the President following Senate confirmation. Each of the individual Military Service Chiefs, outside of their Joint Chiefs of Staff obligations, works directly for the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, i.e., Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - William Joseph ( \`\` Wild Bill '' ) Donovan ( January 1 , 1883 -- February 8 , 1959 ) was a United States soldier , lawyer , intelligence officer and diplomat . Donovan is best remembered as the wartime head of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency , during World War II. He is also known as the \`\` Father of American Intelligence '' and the \`\` Father of Central Intelligence '' . A decorated veteran of World War I , General Donovan is the only person to have received all four of the United States ' highest awards : The Medal of Honor , the Distinguished Service Cross , the Distinguished Service Medal , and the National Security Medal . He is also a recipient of the Silver Star and Purple Heart , as well as decorations from a number of other nations for his service during both World Wars . - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.

Reconstruct the phrase in Finnish, respecting grammar rules and word choice. Step 1: Identify and understand the meaning/role of each word in the phrase in English - \\"Thank\\" is a verb expressing gratitude. - \\"you\\" is the object pronoun referring to the person being thanked. - \\"Commissioner\\" is a title for a person holding a certain office or position of authority. - \\"Bangemann\\" is a proper noun, the last name of the commissioner.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the specific name of the heavenly figures whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes? Answer the above question based on the context below: Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of \\"protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red\\". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly \\"drawn into empathy with the revolving forms\\".Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of... A:","completion":"The specific name of the heavenly figures described in this context, whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes, is not explicitly mentioned. However, they are likely saints or other religious figures depicted in the paintings of Stefan Lochner, a German artist known for blending elements of International Gothic and Northern Renaissance styles. These heavenly figures, surrounded by angels, seem to be a stylistic element in Lochner's works to convey a sense of harmony and create an empathic connection with the viewer."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you are given dvd product reviews in German language.

A veteran Kansas City, Kan., police captain was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon during a confrontation that followed a reported drive-by shooting and a police chase. Capt. Robert Melton was shot about 2 p.m. at 22nd Street and Haskell Avenue in Kansas City, Kan. Two people were in custody, police said. Emergency medical crews performed CPR on Melton on the way to the University of Kansas Hospital but he had no blood pressure or heart beat when he arrived at 2:22 p.m. “Despite our best efforts, the officer was pronounced (dead) at 2:55 p.m.,” said trauma surgeon James Howard at a press conference at the hospital. SIGN UP SHARE COPY LINK Capt. Robert Melton, a veteran who served in Afghanistan, was shot about 2 p.m. at 22nd and Haskell in Kansas City, Kan. and by 2:45 p.m. one person was in custody and police had detained another person. A man who grew up in the neighborhood react Melton was 46 years old and had served a quarter-century in law enforcement. A veteran of the Kansas Army National Guard, he served in Afghanistan. It is the second time in less than three months that a Kansas City, Kan., police officer was shot and killed. Detective Brad Lancaster, 39, a nine-year veteran of the department, was killed May 9. Melton’s shooting also comes in the wake of recent multiple shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La., which occurred in the context of police shootings of black men in incidents across the country. The death pushes the number of law enforcement officers fatally shot in the line of duty to 31 so far this year — up from about 16 at this point last year, and ahead of the average midyear total, which is about 25, according to FBI data. The numbers have spiked considerably just in recent days, with more than a third of these deaths coming in a single 12-day span. But Mark Holland, mayor of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan., cautioned at a brief news conference at the hospital Tuesday that the community should not draw premature conclusions about Melton’s killing. “We’re aware that this is not happening in a microcosm,” Holland said. “But we just want to encourage everyone not to jump to conclusions about what happened today. We need to do a thorough investigation and we need to get the facts before we make assumptions about what may or may not have happened.” Tuesday’s incident began with a report of a drive-by shooting about 1:30 p.m. at Second Street and Edgerton Driver near downtown Kansas City, Kan. at the Juniper Gardens public housing complex. When police arrived, a vehicle containing the suspected shooter or shooters took off and there was a chase that ended near 22nd Street and Haskell Avenue about 3 miles away. “As Capt. Melton was arriving the suspects fell from the vehicle and opened fire, striking Capt. Melton and fatally wounding him,” Kansas City, Kan., Police Chief Terry Zeigler, also speaking at the press conference, said. “I don’t have any more details than that and it may change as we work our way through this investigation.” Melton reportedly was shot in the head but neither Zeigler nor Holland would take questions. Another briefing is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Wednesday. “Right now we just need to be in prayer for (Melton’s) family and for our police department,” Holland said. “Not only in this department but everywhere in our country. And prayer for our communities. Our communities are broken right now. “My encouragement is we not go down a path of fear and conclusions and hatred, but we go down a path of thoughtful, prayerful reflection about what we can all do to make our communities safer.” Melton worked for the police department’s bureau of operations, a position he held since May 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile. He managed staffing and personnel in that role. Prior to becoming captain, Melton held the rank of sergeant since 2006. He had been a patrol officer in Kansas City, Kan., from 1999 to 2006 following a nine-year career as a police lieutenant for the Wyandotte County sheriff’s department. He served in the Kansas Army National Guard and was deployed with a tank squadron to Afghanistan from Sept 2010 to March 2012. Melton was a member of the honor guard at Detective Lancaster’s funeral in May. At the University of Kansas Hospital Tuesday, officers filed in and out of the emergency room doors, most in uniform and some in street clothes. One officer wiped tears from her face as she returned to her patrol car. Friends of Melton began changing their Facebook profile photos Tuesday afternoon to a police badge with a black stripe over it. Lansing resident Brionna Cline and her daughter took flowers to police headquarters. With all the police deaths recently, she needed to do something, she said. “I just wanted to show my support,” she said. Ronnie Padilla grew up in the neighborhood where the shooting happened and his parents still live there. He said Tuesday that Melton’s death was sad and shocked him. “We should be different, not answer with violence, you know?” he said. Statements of condolence poured in Tuesday. “Serving his community, Captain Melton today made the ultimate sacrifice laying down his life in the line of duty,” said Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback. “Kansans everywhere mourn his loss, grieve with his family, and pray for his fellow brothers and sisters in blue. Every day they risk their lives to protect ours and we are grateful for their service.” Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer urged all Kansans to pray for unity and healing. Melton was an alum of Kansas City Kansas Community College and President Dr. Doris Givens issued a statement. “We were terribly saddened to hear of the death of Captain Melton,” she said. “Our sincere condolences and prayers go out to his family, friends and fellow officers.” Word about the shooting began spreading at 2:02 p.m.: Kansas City, Kan., Police Chief Terry Zeigler tweeted, “We have an officer shot at 22nd & Haskell. Start prayers, unknown condition.” About 30 minutes earlier police received a call about an armed disturbance at an apartment complex, Juniper Gardens, at Second Street and Edgerton Drive. The caller told police that several people in a car were firing shots at them. Officers arrived within minutes. At that time, three or four people bailed from the car. An officer took one person into custody near there. Shortly before 2 p.m., an officer tried to stop another person. Multiple shots were fired and Melton was hit. Police were told that an officer was down at 1:58 p.m. We have an officer shot at 22nd & Haskell. Start prayers, unknown condition. — Terry Zeigler (@KCKPDChief) July 19, 2016 Police blocked off Haskell Avenue where Melton was shot between 18th Street and 24th Street in their search, and one suspect was arrested in the area. It was unclear when and where police arrested the second suspect. Police swarmed the area with dozens of officers, some with rifles. Several police were taking cover behind cars at 16th Street and Quindaro Boulevard. A woman came out of a home there with her hands up. Several officers were seen crouching in the street behind a police car with their guns drawn toward the home. The woman who came out walked up to an officer who was holding a ballistic shield. She stood and talked with the officers. Then she walked away from the officers about 10 feet away toward the home and appeared to be yelling to someone in the house. She told police an 8-year-old and 3-year-old were in the home. About 30 minutes later, two small children came out of the house and went to the woman. Police moved them out of the way. About 3:08, a SWAT team shielded by ballistic shields approached and entered the house. About 3:34 p.m. the officers left the house without anyone in custody. A vehicle was towed from the scene. Many in the Juniper Gardens neighborhood said they work nights, and slept through the afternoon to wake up and find their streets blocked off as a crime scene. Late Tuesday afternoon, a dozen law enforcement officers combed the neighborhood identifying and finding bullet casings and other evidence from the disturbance earlier that day. Tuesday evening police said they were not looking for more suspects “at this time.” In May, Curtis Ayers, 29, of Tonganoxie shot Lancaster near the Kansas Speedway as he assisted other officers called to the area after Ayers was seen looking into vehicles outside nearby Hollywood Casino. After Lancaster was shot, Ayers allegedly fled in the detective’s unmarked police car. He then allegedly carjacked a woman’s vehicle and stole another man’s car in Tonganoxie. Later that afternoon he allegedly shot a woman in Kansas City in another alleged carjacking attempt. Ayers was charged with capital murder in Lancaster’s slaying. He also faces several other felony charges related to crimes that occurred the day that Lancaster was fatally shot. The Star’s Robert A. Cronkleton, Katy Bergen, Glenn E.

Chief Terry Zeigler originally tweeted early Tuesday afternoon that an officer, later identified as Capt. Robert David Melton, had been shot at 22nd and Haskell. According to police, officers responded to a shots fired call at 1:33 p.m. at Second and Edgerton. The caller said multiple people were shooting at him from a vehicle. Officers arrived at the scene at 1:37 p.m. The suspects fled from their vehicle after crashing it into a fence in the 1500 block of Rowland. An officer took the driver of the vehicle into custody. As Melton searched for the other suspects in his squad car and made contact with one of them at 1:57 p.m., multiple shots were fired, and Melton was hit. The police captain had boxed in the suspect before he was shot numerous times.

What is the answer?","completion":"Skanderbeg, also known as Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu, is considered the national hero of Albania. Born in 1405, Skanderbeg was a prominent 15th-century military leader and nobleman, celebrated for his remarkable dedication to resisting the Ottoman Empire's expansion into the Balkans. Initially, as a young nobleman, Skanderbeg was taken hostage by the Ottomans, where he was educated and trained in their military system. Eventually, he became a high-ranking officer in the Ottoman Empire and participated in their campaigns. However, in 1443, Skanderbeg decided to abandon the Ottoman forces and return to his native land, where he led a rebellion against the invading Ottomans. From 1443 to 1468, Skanderbeg successfully managed to unite the various Albanian principalities and lead them in numerous battles against the Ottoman Empire. His most famous victory took place in the Battle of Torvioll in 1444, where his small army of 15,000 soldiers decisively defeated an Ottoman army three times larger. Skanderbeg's military genius and his ability to use unconventional tactics, such as guerrilla warfare, enabled him to hold off the mighty Ottoman Empire for more than two decades. Skanderbeg's struggle to preserve the territorial integrity of his native land and his commitment to keeping Albania free from Ottoman rule has become a significant and cherished part of Albanian history. As a result, Skanderbeg is remembered as a symbol of national pride and an inspiring figure who epitomizes the Albanian spirit of independence, patriotism, and resilience. To this day, Skanderbeg's legacy is honored in Albania through numerous monuments, cultural festivals, and literary works. The Skanderbeg Museum in Krujë, close to his castle, stands as a testament to the nation's enduring appreciation of this remarkable leader's efforts to protect and preserve their homeland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: So many kids, so many stories. Parents die, leaving kids devastated and unable to speak for days. Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing. Who deserved to go to Cal? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - The AP Lit student - The mother - The principal - not enough information Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine who among the three individuals mentioned - the AP Lit student, the mother, or the principal - deserved to go to UC Berkeley. \\"Deserving\\" to attend a specific university is subjective and can be influenced by various factors, including academic achievements, extracurricular activities, personal qualities, and contextual elements. The AP Lit student shows that she is ambitious and has a strong aspiration to attend UC Berkeley. She has even engaged in public speaking activities, which might demonstrate her leadership skills and interest in education reform. However, her decision to neglect her homework and bank on excuses to get her grades adjusted raises questions about her work ethic, discipline, and sense of responsibility. The mother's actions in defending her daughter and seeking the change in her grade are understandable from the perspective of a caring parent. Nonetheless, her role in teaching her daughter that excuses can prevail over hard work and accountability is not ideal. The principal, while trying to provide support, might have unintentionally promoted an unhealthy notion of \\"social justice\\" by adjusting the student's grades without considering the implications. In this scenario, the principal's actions might have compromised the integrity of the education system and sent a negative message to other students about the value of genuine effort. The question requires us to choose who deserved to attend UC Berkeley. Still, there is not enough information provided about each person's background, academic achievements, or personal qualities to make a fair and objective judgment. The passage primarily illustrates how individuals may struggle with and approach challenges in life. However, it does not provide enough criteria to determine who among the three is the most deserving candidate for admission to UC Berkeley."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs. His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.\\"Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78. His body was flown to Adelaide where, on 2 March, he was buried in the Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose's ashes.

Article: How would you like to teach yourself, rather than have teachers? According to the UK's Department of Education and Skills, students will teach themselves in the schools of the future. This means that there will be no more problems such as finding enough teachers. Estelle Morris, the UK Education Secretary, opened the 2002 Education Technology Conference in London recently. To start the conference, she presented a video showing a computer--generated model of the school of tomorrow. Greater use of computer technology and classroom assistants will help students develop their own way of learning, Morris said. She added that this is a more exciting as well as a more interesting way of learning. At the same time, teachers will be \\"freed from their traditional role as the source of all knowledge\\". Children of all abilities will \\"form the curriculum around their individual needs.\\" They will \\"learn in their own time, at their own speed and in their own environment\\". At home or at school, they will follow their learning programmes by looking at online libraries and watching lessons by world-class teachers and subject experts. Instead of going on field trips, students will use virtual reality. If they don't understand something, they can ask other students--\\"take part in virtual communities with learners with similar needs\\"--or e-mail their teachers. They will hand in their work electronically to be \\"auto-marked\\". The classroom of the future is fast becoming a reality. And the Department of Education will soon produce a guide to help schools adapt buildings for new technology, Morris said. These ideas are based on the UK government's plan to create an education system that provides students with a strong grounding of knowledge and skills at primary school level. And provides the chance for students to develop their individual skills at secondary school level. Question: If the students do not understand something, they can _ .

Summarize this article: Race takes another turn as Santorum gains 14 points since winning Feb. 7 GOP contests PRINCETON, NJ -- Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum are now statistically tied for the lead in Republican registered voters' preferences for the 2012 GOP nomination -- 32% to 30%, respectively. Newt Gingrich, who led the field as recently as late January, is now third, favored by 16%, while Ron Paul's support has dwindled to 8%, the lowest level yet seen for him in 2012. These results are based on Gallup Daily tracking from Feb. 8-12 -- the first Gallup tracking period conducted wholly after Santorum's sweep of the Feb. 7 state nominating contests. Santorum's 14-point surge in support since just before Feb. 7, from 16% to 30%, appears to have come at the expense of all of his major opponents. Support for Romney and Gingrich has declined by five and six percentage points, respectively, over the same period, and support for Paul, by three points. The percentage unsure has increased slightly, from 11% to 13%. Santorum's Wins Spur Robust Bounce Santorum's surge coming off of his wins in Colorado, Missouri, and Minnesota is not unusual, given the volatility already seen in national Republican preferences. However, the magnitude of his 14-point gain over the five-day periods bracketing the Feb. 7 contests is the largest post-primary/caucus bounce Gallup has recorded since the primary season began. By contrast, Romney's support grew by six points in the first five days after his apparent win in the Iowa caucuses -- with state election officials revising the results and declaring Santorum the winner a few weeks later. Santorum's support also swelled, by 12 points -- from 6% to 18% -- within the first week after he purportedly placed second in Iowa. Romney then enjoyed a seven-point gain after winning the New Hampshire primary. Gingrich gained nine points after winning the South Carolina primary, building on a 10-point gain he made in the period between New Hampshire and South Carolina. Romney then recovered by 10 points after his decisive victory in Florida. It is too soon to say whether Romney's slim victory in Saturday's Maine caucuses (or his important symbolic victory in the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) straw poll the same day) will advance his support, thereby stalling or reversing some of Santorum's recent gains. Bottom Line Gallup Daily tracking conducted in the days after Santorum's sweep of three little-anticipated nominating contests last week shows national Republicans responding as they have each time there has been a big win or an upset in the caucuses and primaries thus far -- by jumping on the winner's bandwagon. Romney's win in Nevada on Feb. 4 represents the only exception to that, possibly because it was so closely followed by Santorum's victories on Feb. 7. As a result, Santorum is now roughly tied with Romney for the lead, Gingrich has been relegated to third, and Paul is in a weakened fourth position. How long this scenario will last is anyone's guess, but will likely be dictated by the outcome of the next round of primaries at the end of February, in Arizona and Michigan.

In polling conducted Feb. 8-12, 30% of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters favor Santorum while 28% favor Romney. As recently as a month ago, Romney held a 31% to 14% advantage over Santorum among all GOP voters. Santorum is now the clear favorite of Republican and GOP-leaning voters who agree with the Tea Party, as well as white evangelical Republicans. Currently, 42% of Tea Party Republican voters favor Santorum, compared with just 23% who back Romney. Santorum holds an almost identical advantage among white evangelical Republican voters (41% to 23%). The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Feb. 8-12 among 1,501 adults, including 1172 registered voters and 552 Republican and Republican-leaning voters, finds that Barack Obama holds sizable leads over Santorum, Romney and Newt Gingrich in general election match-ups. Obama leads Santorum by 10 points among all registered voters (53% to 43%) and his lead over Romney is nearly as large (52% to 44%). Romney ran about even with Obama in November and mid-January. Obama has a larger advantage over Newt Gingrich than over Santorum or Romney: Obama leads the former House speaker by 18 points (57% to 39%). Obama has made gains among independent voters. Today, 51% of independents favor Obama in a matchup against Romney, up from 40% a month ago. (View detailed tables to see a full demographic breakdown of Obama-Romney and Obama-Santorum matchups). Romney Trailing among GOP Conservatives In the early GOP primaries, Romney has struggled at times in winning over the conservative elements of the Republican electorate – Tea Party supporters, conservatives and white evangelical Republicans. The new poll shows that nationally he trails Santorum among all three groups. In contrast, Romney holds leads over Santorum among non-Tea Party Republicans (34% to 19%) and moderate and liberal Republicans (34% to 20%). While Santorum holds a substantial advantage over Romney among white evangelical Republicans, he also runs about even with Romney among white mainline Protestants (24% Santorum, 30% Romney). Romney also trails Santorum among Republican and GOP-leaning voters who have not completed college (33% to 24%). Romney leads among Republican college graduates (39% to 25%). More Doubts about Romney’s Conservatism, Consistency Three months ago, a slim majority (53%) of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said Mitt Romney was a strong conservative. Today, 42% see him this way, while the number who say he is not a strong conservative has jumped from 33% to 50%. This growing skepticism about Romney’s conservatism is most pronounced among Tea Party Republicans. Among Republican and Republican-leaning voters who agree with the Tea Party, just 29% say Romney is a strong conservative, down from 51% three months ago. Fully 68% of Tea Party Republicans say Romney is not a strong conservative. Fewer Republican voters today think Romney has been consistent as well. By a 48% to 39% margin, more Republicans say Romney does not take consistent positions on the issues. In November, 47% felt he was consistent and just 33% said he was not. By contrast, Romney has lost virtually no ground among Republican voters in evaluations of his qualifications and honesty. Roughly as many today as in November say that he is well-qualified to be president (69%) and that he is honest and trustworthy (64%). These were Romney’s strongest traits in November, and remain so today. Obama Leads in General Election Matchup Barack Obama now holds an eight-point lead over Mitt Romney in a general election matchup, and he has gained significant ground among independent voters. A month ago, 40% of independents said they would back Obama over Romney – today 51% say they would, while the number expressing support for Romney has slipped from 50% to 42%. Over the course of the campaign, Romney’s image among independent voters has suffered substantially. Most notably, the number who believe he is honest and trustworthy has fallen from 53% to 41%, while the number who say he is not has risen from 32% to 45%. And even on his qualifications for the office – Romney’s strong suit – he has lost ground among independents. In November, a 58% majority of independents said Romney was well-qualified to be president, while just 31% said he was not. Today, 48% say he is well qualified, while 41% say he is not. Despite these problems, Romney runs slightly better against Barack Obama among independents than either of the other leading GOP candidates. Independent voters favor Barack Obama over Rick Santorum by a 54% to 40% margin, and favor Obama over Gingrich by a wide 58% to 34% margin. GOP Voters Say Party Would Unite Behind Romney While Romney has lost support in the GOP nomination contest, a majority (57%) of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say that the party would unite solidly behind him if he wins the nomination. Roughly a third (32%) say disagreements within the party will keep many Republicans from supporting him. In February 2008, following that year’s Super Tuesday contests, 58% of Republican voters said the party would unite behind John McCain. A substantial majority (70%) of GOP voters who support Romney for the Republican nomination say the party would coalesce behind the former Massachusetts governor if he is the nominee. A smaller percentage (54%) of Santorum supporters express this view. A majority of GOP voters (55%) also say that it is a good thing the race has not yet been decided. As might be expected, Santorum supporters are more likely than Romney backers to express this view (62% vs. 45%). In the Democratic primary race four years ago, a comparable percentage (57%) of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters in February said it was good for the party that the race had not yet been decided. But that figure fell to 35% in April, as the Democratic primary contest continued. |||||","completion":"Following Rick Santorum's victories in Colorado, Missouri, and Minnesota, he has gained significant support among Republican registered voters in the 2012 GOP nomination race.

Jean-Marie Le Pen (French pronunciation: [Za ma.Ri l@.pen]; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who has served as Honorary President of the National Front since January 2011 and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France since 2004, previously between 1984 to 2003. He previously served as President of the National Front from 1972 to 2011. Le Pen is often nicknamed the \\"Menhir\\", due to his \\"granitic nature\\" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down. It also connects him to France's Celtic origins. Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse. However, Le Pen remains a polarizing figure in France: opinions regarding him tend to be quite strong. A 2002 IPSOS poll showed that while 22% of the electorate have a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% have a very unfavorable opinion. Le Pen and the National Front are described by much of the media and nearly all commentators as far right. Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagree with this label; earlier in his political career, Le Pen described his position as \\"neither right, nor left, but French\\" (ni droite, ni gauche, francais). He later described his position as right-wing and opposed to the \\"socialo-communists\\" and other right-wing parties, which he deems are not real right-wing parties. At other times, for example during the 2002 election campaign, he declared himself \\"socially left-wing, economically right-wing, nationally French\\" (socialement a gauche, economiquement a droite, nationalement francais). He further contends that most of the French political and media class are corrupt and out of touch with the real needs of the common people, and conspire to exclude Le Pen and his party from mainstream politics. Le Pen criticizes the other political parties as the \\"establishment\\" and lumped all major parties (Communist, Socialist, Union for French Democracy (UDF) and Rally for the Republic (RPR)) into the \\"Gang of Four\\" (la bande des quatre - an allusion to the Gang of Four during China's Cultural Revolution).Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why did he say he was just french?","completion":"Jean-Marie Le Pen said he was \\"neither right, nor left, but French\\" (ni droite, ni gauche, francais) to describe his position in politics.

Stillness is good. But this film though was just plain slow. Credit must go to the two main actors. There was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people, misfits really, come together in a very awkward way. There were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them. I also liked the setting and the way it was shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the film's intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the characters.

Q:Given the background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. and the situation: Two people got stuck in a local blizzard. Tom had a bottle of alcohol with him and drank it after he found some kind of shelter in the snow. Dan didn't have alcohol with him. Answer the following question: Which of the two people had more blood vessels dilate? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, Tom, who drank the bottle of alcohol, experienced more blood vessel dilation. The background information states that alcoholic beverages cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood, which creates a sensation of warmth. Since Dan did not consume alcohol, his blood vessels would not have experienced the same level of dilation as Tom's."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - An airline reservation is made - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination - The passenger gets off the plane at their destination.

Read this: While worship in the Temple in Jerusalem included musical instruments (2 Chronicles 29:25–27), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments given the practice of scriptural cantillation. The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as zemirot outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During the Three Weeks musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the counting of the omer between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time. This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as sefirah music. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): How many days are counted between Passover and Shavuot?","completion":"There are 49 days counted between Passover and Shavuot.

The sentiment of the review is positive because the person is describing a situation where their husband's phone was stolen, but they received excellent customer service from T-Mobile and Assurant to quickly replace the phone and help with setting it up.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: An eccentric millionaire is giving Manhattan back to the American Indians — at least his small part of it. Jean-Louis Goldwater Bourgeois, 76, an architectural historian and activist for Native American causes, is in the process of transferring the deed of his 4 million, landmarked West Village house to a nonprofit controlled by the Lenape tribe, the original Manhattanites. “I have a romance with the history of the city, and I have been generally appalled that the land that the city is on has been taken by whites,” he told The Post. “This building is the trophy from major theft. It disgusts me.” He said he feels “rage against what whites have done and some guilt, no, a lot of guilt, that I have profited from this major theft. The right thing to do is to return it.” Bourgeois, the son of the late sculptor Louise Bourgeois, has owned the three-floor clapboard house at 6 Weehawken St. since his family’s LLC bought it in 2006 for 2.2 million. The house dates to 1834, when it was part of a larger city-owned market building. It is believed to be all that is left of the complex. Part of the Weehawken Street Historic District, the building faces West Street and the Hudson River. Bourgeois had lived there for three years when he met Joseph Scabby Robe, a Cree Indian from Manitoba, Canada, during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest downtown. “I told Joseph that I’d like to return the land to the Lenapes,” Bourgeois recalled. “The house isn’t important. It’s the land that the house sits on that’s important.” Robe introduced Bourgeois to Anthony Jay Van Dunk, 54, a chief of the 5,000-member Ramapough Indians, part of the Lenape Nation. Van Dunk, a Brooklyn woodworker, spoke in his native Munsee language at a 2011 UN forum titled The State of Native Americans Today. ‘I have been generally appalled that the land that the city is on has been taken by whites.’ Van Dunk “represents the tribe, and I represent the whites,” Bourgeois said of the meeting that led to the land deal. Both men gave The Post a tour of the house last week. Van Dunk wore a tribal headdress. Bourgeois wore a fuzzy hat that looked like a penguin. “I told Jean-Louis about the idea of a patahmaniikan, or a prayer house,” Van Dunk said. “He liked it, and we went forward from there.” Besides the ongoing legal work to establish the nonprofit project under Lenape oversight, the men had to conduct a ritual ceremony. “The purpose of that was to let the spirits know what was about to happen and what our vision was for the space,” Van Dunk said. “We had a pipe. We had a smudging. We had prayers being said. It was a healing. We wanted the spirits to know we were coming in with a good heart. “Our doors are always east and west,” Van Dunk added. “In most native traditions you always have your entry door in the east and then, spiritually, the west is how you leave after your journey here on earth is done.” The prayer house is “going to be a place of safety,” he said. “The purpose is to get indigenous people in touch with their language, their tradition.” Bourgeois, who just returned to New York after spending eight weeks in North Dakota protesting the proposed pipeline near the Sioux Standing Rock Indian Reservation, said, “I’m extremely interested in the Lenapes.” He said he was a “benefactor” at Standing Rock. “I’ve given over 600,000 to the Oceti Sakowin camp site,” home to Dakota ­Access Pipeline protesters, he said. “Money goes to buying food, firewood, protective hay bales and transportation. I spent time at the Sacred Fire. Standing Rock is a turning point in American history.” The Lenapes were the original inhabitants of Mannahatta — land of many hills. They were widely represented as the tribe that sold the island to the Dutch for 24 worth of trinkets in 1626 — a story debunked by many modern historians. “The native people actively engaged with the Dutch, who were part of the fur trade in this area, so there were constant exchanges,” said Johanna Gorelick, of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in New York City. “They did not believe at that time that land could be privately owned. It was something that wasn’t part of their world view. The sale of Manhattan was a misunderstanding.” ||||| It is being maintained as closely as possible to the way it looked during its owner’s lifetime. “The house has a vibe,” said Jerry Gorovoy, who was Bourgeois’s assistant and friend for 30 years and is president of the foundation. (Bourgeois’s two surviving sons, Jean-Louis and Alain, also serve on the foundation’s board.) “It has a heart and a soul. People are very moved when they come here.” The utilitarian décor is in keeping with Bourgeois’s pragmatic nature. “If the floor was good and she could stand on it and it would hold the sculpture, that’s all she cared about,” Mr. Gorovoy explained. “She was not interested in decoration or embellishment or pretty things.” Bourgeois purchased the townhouse in 1962 for less than 30,000 with her husband, the art historian Robert Goldwater, whom she met in her native Paris in August 1938, and married a month later. She moved with him to New York, where they raised three sons. Upon Goldwater’s death in 1973, Bourgeois drastically reconfigured the house. She moved out of their rear second-floor bedroom, leaving it and Goldwater’s third-floor library mostly untouched as a kind of memorial. She installed a single bed in the front room of the second floor. (Many years later, after arthritis had made climbing the staircase difficult, she relocated her bedroom to the front parlor on the first floor.) In her years as a wife and mother, Bourgeois had used the basement for her work. Now, she turned the whole building into an art studio. “I think from a psychological point of view, she was transforming it so radically that it was her way of dealing with extreme loss,” Mr. Gorovoy said. A psychological explanation is appropriate for an artist who demarcated her career by sharp lines of mourning. Upon the death of her mother in 1932, she turned from her studies in mathematics and philosophy to become an artist. Her mother, who restored antique tapestries in the family business in Paris, represented an ideal of care and protectiveness to Louise. Bourgeois’s iconic spider sculptures, the artist said, were an allusion to her thread-weaving mother. A seven-and-a-half-foot-high pair of bronze arachnids from 2003, “Spider Couple,” has been installed in the townhouse garden. Her father’s death in 1951 led Bourgeois to begin a decades-long Freudian psychoanalysis, and Goldwater’s death freed — or forced — her to devote herself entirely to her art. Although her husband encouraged her to pursue her sculpture, she would hold back, wanting to be a good wife. “She was very guilt-ridden,” Mr. Gorovoy said. In her late years, Bourgeois received widespread acclaim, which did not surprise her. “The art world loves young men and old women,” she told Mr. Gorovoy. Death, perhaps, trumps even old age. This fall, her sculptures were featured in the opening show of the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow, the talked-about public gallery in Gorky Park that was founded by Dasha Zhukova and renovated by Rem Koolhaas. (The exhibition, still on view, originated at the Haus der Kunst in Munich.) A small Bourgeois show centered on a 1947 series of engravings is currently at the National Gallery in Washington. One of the spider sculptures sold at auction at Christie’s New York in November for 28.2 million, a record for a postwar female artist. And when the annex of the Tate Modern opens in June in London, Bourgeois’s work will inaugurate a series of Artist Rooms, dedicated to exploring the sensibility of a significant modern or contemporary artist. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A kind and rich man named Jean-Louis Goldwater Bourgeois is giving his house in Manhattan to the Lenape tribe, the original people who lived there.
