It is an holistic approach to health that focuses on the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is known as an effective form of treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and certain medications. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications if left untreated, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Ayurveda aims to restore balance and harmony to the body, which is essential for proper functioning of the body’s systems. Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and dietary modifications. One of the most commonly prescribed ayurvedic remedies for diabetes is the use of herbal medicines. These are natural substances that are used to treat the symptoms and root causes of diabetes. The most common herbs used for diabetes management are: • Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia): This herb has been used for centuries to help lower blood sugar levels. It is believed to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps the body to regulate sugar levels. • Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known to help reduce sugar cravings and decrease cholesterol levels. It is also believed to help improve the production of insulin. • Turmeric (Curcuma longa): This herb has anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce blood sugar levels. • Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek is believed to help improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with blood sugar control. • Amalaki (Emblica officinalis): This ayurvedic herb is known to help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring balance and harmony to the body through lifestyle modifications, herbal remedies, and dietary changes. While there is no cure for diabetes, ayurvedic herbs and lifestyle changes can be used to help manage the condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.

Minecraft, has indeed been written in Java, a language that is often criticized for not being optimized for high-performance 3D games. So why did Mojang Studios choose to use Java for Minecraft instead of recreating it in C++, which is often considered a more suitable language for 3D games? The decision to use Java for Minecraft was primarily driven by historical reasons. When Markus Persson, also known as \\"Notch,\\" first started developing Minecraft, he chose Java because it was a language he was familiar with and it provided cross-platform compatibility, allowing the game to be played on various operating systems. At the time, Minecraft was a small indie project, and the performance limitations of Java were not a significant concern. As Minecraft gained popularity and Mojang Studios grew as a company, rewriting the entire game from scratch in C++ would have been a massive undertaking. It would have required significant resources, including time, money, and expertise, to recreate the game in a different language while ensuring that it retained its core gameplay and features. Additionally, Mojang Studios would have needed to redevelop and optimize the game for multiple platforms, which would have been a daunting task. Moreover, despite its performance limitations, Java has several advantages that made it a viable choice for Minecraft. Java provides a high level of abstraction, which makes it relatively easy to develop and maintain complex codebases. It also has a large community of developers, a wealth of libraries and tools, and a robust ecosystem of plugins and mods that have contributed to Minecraft's modding community, allowing players to customize and extend the game to their liking. Another important factor to consider is that Minecraft's gameplay is not as reliant on cutting-edge graphics and realistic physics as some other modern 3D games. Minecraft's block-based world and simple graphics style do not require the same level of computational power as more graphically intensive games. This means that despite Java's performance limitations, it can still deliver a satisfactory gaming experience for Minecraft players. Furthermore, transitioning from one programming language to another involves risks and challenges, including potential bugs, loss of existing features, and changes in gameplay mechanics. Such a transition would also require players to update their game clients, and it could potentially alienate some of the existing player base."},{"prompt":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

Let me cite it with a true example. My father is a shop owner in india(tier 3 city) and whenever I visit my town,I sit with him for 3 hours daily just to help him with his work. Ours is a wholesale shop and there is lot of scope for bargaining and we decide the price according to personality ,body language, and style of talking and our relations with our customer.Suppose a candle is priced 20 1. A customer comes to buy 12 candles.I will see the way he talks,and how confidently he talks. If he is a regular customer of ours he will talk in a very confident way bcoz he knows the price which I will charge him that is 16 for one candle. So 16 × 12 = 192 for 12 candlesHe seems to be normal and has no anxiety on his face and body language seems to be alright so I judge him believing that he is our regular customer and he knows the price so I cannot charge him anything more than 16.So I charge him 16. (I visit my hometown only twice a year so I dont know who really our customers are,I have no other option rather than judging them based on their body language and confidence) 2. Comes a 2nd manHe asks for the price of 12 candles..I say him 18. He then bargains, to which I very politley deny selling beyond 17.5Looking at his personality and confidence in his voice, I judge him that at what price I can settle the deal and accordingly I settle it.Since I found this man grtting confused in his own tone.Rythm of tone varying and is not firm at his price, it seems he just wants to bargain and that too he doesnot appear to be good in bargaining. I quote my final price of 18 an he has nothing but to accept my quote.And ends up paying. All the prices that I offer are based on the person's confidence and body language.Sometimes I have to sell lesser than my least price 16.5 because the customer talks me in such a way ,denting me impressed and confused. Self confidence helps you a lot for your business to grow and will give you some added benefits which others dont seem to enjoy. If you have nothing but confidence on self, you can do anything.People judge you by your self confidence. The world is stereotypical and judgemental. The first and the foremost thing people will judge you will be based on your body language. Your body language is representation of your confidence. Your walking style,position of head, placement of shoulders,eye contact, feet movement. All represent your confidence. Self confidence results in positive body language and positive body language results in greater self confidence. **FAKE IT TILL YOU BECOME IT**- amy cuddy Check out TED TALK OF AMY CUDDY Self confidence will help you in every aspect of your life.Be it cracking deals, proposing your dream girl, talking a stranger, landing a job or whatever be it.

Should I learn servlet, JSP, any framework, or any other language? And what should be the sequence of language?","completion":"Thanks for A2A Hey, nice knowing that you want to learn some new things. That is the beauty of computer programming, you can learn anything, all you need is right with you, your computer, dedication and a couple of good courses if you may. Since you mentioned that you have already learnt Java, JSP and Servlet I would assume that you would like to go forward in the direction of web development. If you want to learn enterprise software then I would suggest Spring Framework, and other helper projects like Hibernate, etc. I would suggest you to try Spring WebFlux which uses reactor library to make non blocking servers. Learn this one and if possible try to learn Spring Cloud Distributed systems are what will drive us to future and Spring Cloud helps you in that. If you want to try something new, I would strongly recommend MEAN or MERN stack. It is crazy good. I would also suggest looking into DJANGO which uses python, so learning that would make you well versed in that language. Another one that I have in my mind and I myself am planning to learn is Web Go which uses GoLang as it’s primary language. Go is super sick man, it’s goroutines are love. Now that was for web development from my side, why not go ahead and learn some new tech itself. Try things like Big Data, ML, Deep Learning, NLP, etc. In the end I would suggest to not worry about anything, you have all you need just practice and you will be good at anything you want. Try out new things, they won’t take much time to learn and while doing so you may come to know about something you love and focus on that moving forward.

I’ll stick with INFJs, simply because I understand them best, for my example. INFJs usually long to make a difference in the world, to help people. That is the what. The Enneagram covers the how. As a type 8, my passion is in defending and leading. Type 8 INFJs are determined to be some kind of motivational leader who fights to end injustice, because that is how type 8s respond to a challenge.

This way, the constant ringing of the clock will force you to wake up and get to your business without having to snooze. Second tip is to brush with your non dominant hand while bodily awake but with sleepy eyes. Brushing with your dominant or your primary hand daily will wire your brain to record it as a habit. Hence, your brain will subconsciously continue the act of brushing while you may still be in the drowsy mode. So try using your non dominant hand, i.e if you are right-handed then use your left hand and vice versa as your brain will sense a deviation in the usual activity resulting in your body mood shift. Make sure to occasionally switch sides when the method fails to wake you. Third tip is to allow light in the room. Be it sunlight or light in another form, try to allow some form of it into the room, preferably near your face. This will aide in waking you up.

Here are some general tips to help you manage your blood sugar levels: 1. **Healthy Diet:** Pay close attention to your diet. Choose foods that have a low glycemic index (GI), as they cause slower and more gradual increases in blood sugar. These include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts. Limit your intake of refined carbohydrates, sugary foods, and drinks, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar. 2. **Portion Control:** Watch your portion sizes to avoid consuming too many carbohydrates at once, which can lead to high blood sugar levels. 3. **Regular Meals and Snacks:** Aim for regular, balanced meals throughout the day to maintain stable blood sugar levels. Avoid skipping meals, as this can cause fluctuations in blood sugar. 4. **Limit Sugary Drinks:** Avoid sugary sodas, fruit juices, and other sweetened beverages. Instead, choose water, herbal teas, or sugar-free alternatives. 5. **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve insulin sensitivity, which allows your body to use blood sugar more effectively. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week, along with strength training exercises on two or more days per week. 6. **Weight Management:** If you're overweight or obese, losing weight can significantly improve blood sugar control. It can also reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 7. **Medication and Insulin:** If you have diabetes and are prescribed medication or insulin, take them as directed by your healthcare provider. Be mindful of the timing and dosages to manage your blood sugar effectively. 8. **Monitor Blood Sugar:** Regularly check your blood sugar levels as advised by your healthcare provider. This can help you understand how your diet, exercise, and medications affect your blood sugar and make necessary adjustments. 9. **Stress Management:** High levels of stress can affect blood sugar levels. Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or any activity that helps you manage stress. 10. **Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Lack of sleep can impact blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. 11. **Work with Healthcare Professionals:** Regularly visit your healthcare team, including your doctor, diabetes educator, and dietitian. They can provide personalized guidance and support in managing your blood sugar. Remember, individual responses to these strategies can vary, so it's essential to work with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized plan that suits your specific needs and medical condition. If you have diabetes, always follow your doctor's advice and attend regular check-ups to monitor your blood sugar control effectively."},{"prompt":"f Thatcher is so hated, why did Sky News Australia say Britain became great under her and said they liked her?","completion":"Rupert Murdoch is a known right wing nut.

Without the monetary infusion coming from sales, capital will run dry and any hopes for improvement or expansion is nil at best. Several levels within the company will be affected such as the cost of operation and maintenance, employee salary, etc if there is no money available. Closing as many deals as possible should be one of the foremost priorities of every business that is hoping to thrive and succeed in their chosen niche. The significant amount of sales helps you regain your capital and pave the way for expansion and increase of operation. A webinar I have come across recently talks about how you can take advantage of three powerful tools and revolutionize your sales process to close more deals. Here are the following [LINKED_TEXT: tools] [URL: https://www.outsourceaccelerator.com/articles/10-best-free-bpm-software-tools/] mentioned: Process Street - is an API that can turn your daily processes into executable workflows. These tools can house all of your processes and procedures and hook them into any of your other tools via automation.Panda Doc - is a sales operation tracking tool that will help you monitor all the documents you send out to your clients such as proposals and contracts to streamline your sales team's activities and help them focus more on closing deals.Groove - a sales engagement platform that will help you manage your inbound and outbound sales process to be on top of them and manage your clients better. This is the sales platform used by giants such as Google, Slack, Asana, and Uber that helped them grow their sales pipeline efficiently.SaneBox - keeps your email inbox orderly by committing your behavioral pattern and determine which emails you consider important and which are not. This way, you do not have to scroll down your long list of emails to make sure you did not miss any or jumping from folder to folder in the fear that one of them might have gotten lost.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","completion":"I don’t know if it is a war crime, but the use of the white flag or signalling your intention to surrender then taking up arms again is a violation of the Geneva Convention and is considered a criminal offence. As is the violation of the Red Cross. Examples of this actually happening occurred in the Falklands campaign. At Goose Green, some Argentine soldiers indicated their willingness to surrender, when some Para’s went forward, they were then fired on by a supporting trench who clearly saw what the other trench was doing. The trench indicating their desire to surrender then took up their arms again. The Para’s would have been within their rights after that point to ignore any attempts to surrender by the Argentine Forces. An Argentine gun crew opened fire and murdered two Army Helicopter pilots whose aircraft had been shot down. Once the helicopter crew were out of the helicopter, they inflated their life vests. Aircrew life vests are brightly coloured (usually a colour known as “International Orange” IIRC). This indicates that the aircrew are no longer to be considered as combatants. The Argentine gun group opened fired and murdered those defenceless aircrew. The ARA Bahía Paraíso - a hospital ship and displaying the Red Cross - abused the Red Cross symbol. While in port in Argentina it was filled with munitions and soldiers, all hidden by boxes of medical supplies. When Red Cross officials tried to inspect the cargo, they were told that it was too urgently needed for the Argentine wounded. The Red Cross official then let the ship sail. By carrying arms, ammunition and combatant soldiers, this was a violation of the Red Cross symbol."},{"prompt":"any way?","completion":"Thanks for the A2A Sir! Well , here is a short story : There was a business executive who was deep in debt and could see no way out.Creditors were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy.Suddenly an old man appeared before him. “I can see that something is troubling you,” he said.After listening to the executive’s woes, the old man said, “I believe I can help you.”He asked the man his name, wrote out a check, and pushed it into his hand saying, “Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.”Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come.The business executive saw in his hand a check for 500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world!“I can erase my money worries in an instant!” he realized. But instead, the executive decided to put the uncashed check in his safe. Just knowing it was there might give him the strength to work out a way to save his business, he thought.With renewed optimism, he negotiated better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big sales. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again.Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man.“I’m so glad I caught him!” she cried. “I hope he hasn’t been bothering you. He’s always escaping from the rest home and telling people he’s John D. Rockefeller.”And she led the old man away by the arm.The astonished executive just stood there, stunned. All year long he’d been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, convinced he had half a million dollars behind him.Suddenly, he realized that it wasn’t the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his newfound self-confidence that gave him the power to achieve anything he went after."},{"prompt":"w does the Canadian healthcare system prevent people from going to the doctor excessively when they aren't sick, with no copays and deductibles?","completion":"Why would someone who isn't sick go to the doctor? Even if you were unemployed, there would be about a thousand things you could do to fill your day if you weren't sick. Healthcare is a need, not a want.

The Tragedy of the Commons doesn't apply to everything."},{"prompt":"w would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman?","completion":"If a male employee were to tell me that he refuses to meet individually or attend a business lunch with a female simply because he's married, I’d just say that's a load of bull. If in the other hand any male raises the very same concern due to fears of unfounded sexual harassment claims, I'd say they're completely justified. In this #metoo age, all men working with women are simply walking court-cases waiting to happen. All a woman need do is to raise a complaint against a fellow colleague for the most ridiculous reason and HR will fall for it hook, line and sinker. Of course many will say that if you don't do anything wrong, you have nothing to fear. However unfortunate experience has taught me that women will treasure their reputation and moral standing more than your career or more than your very life. If that extra flirt over that drink or that little episode in that business trip with you years ago ever makes it to the office gossip channels, you're done for. She can't of course admit to anything thrashy, so obviously it was all you. She never invited you back to her room, you had of course forced your way in there. For God's sake, she didn't even want to come on the trip all alone with you in the first place. She just went along with it because she was afraid it would have impacted her upcoming promotion and of course she never said anything all these years because she was intimidated. At the end it's just your word against hers and we all know how that will go. Bang, there goes your career and the wife you met and married a couple of years after the incident walks out on you and files for divorce. So yes, I can very well understand a man hesitant to place himself right in the line of fire and as a boss you should actuality anticipate such problems yourself and try not to place your employees in such potentially difficult situations. That said I did start this with if the guy says he wouldn't do this because he's married, it’s just a load of bull. So how can I then accept the very same thing for fear of harassment? Well because it’s the reason that counts. An employee unwilling to compromise because of his marriage is bringing his personal issues into the workplace. The same way this issue crept into the office, other personal issues will invariably soon follow and that's bad news. The latter on the other hand is fearing for his career and by extension showing respect to the company. Anybody finding excuses to fulfill his job is a liability. Anybody however who is concerned about losing the opportunity to be part of the team is worth hanging on to."},{"prompt":"Why did Will Smith slap his costar at the Oscars?","completion":"Q: “Why did Will Smith just slap Chris Rock at the Oscars?” … There is a fundamental reason why this happened, and why you see the same thing happening all around the world. It’s a reason that nobody wants to consider, and the reason why humanity now stands on the precipice of self-destruction, … and the clock is ticking! First, here is a side-by-side photo of Will Smith and Chris Rock as they truly are: They are two prominent celebrities in the entertainment industry. Over the years they have helped us to laugh, cry, and think more deeply about life, who we are, and what we represent. They aren’t bad people. Will and Chris are both beautiful, wonderful individuals. And at their core, they are no different than you and me. The only difference is that “life” has moved them into the world spotlight. If you could rewind the universe to its earliest known origin, you’d discover what’s called the [LINKED_TEXT: hadron epoch] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron_epoch] which began a mere 20 microseconds after the Big Bang. This strange period in universal existence represents a cosmic struggle between hadrons and antihadrons: the fundamental building blocks of everything that exists today. A hadron and antihadron are simultaneously annihilated the instant they come in contact with each other. Yes, the universe was born out of conflict. This same cosmic war has been waging over the past 13.8 billion years in the form of positive and negative, matter and antimatter, strong and weak, predator and prey, life and death, science and religion, and ultimately evolving into love and hate. What happened between Will Smith and Chris Rock is a fully evolved version of “Existence” showing us who we are, how far we’ve come, and our inevitable demise should we fail to change our direction. Existence is offering us a movie about “us” and using two great actors to deliver its message. Humanity is unknowing dividing into two distinct particle types: Good and Evil. The only problem is that both sides consider their side Good and the other side Evil. Yes, we all have our fully justified reasoning for labeling the “other side” as repugnant, don’t we? However, at the fundamental level “Existence” doesn’t care one way or the other. Existence is indifferent. Existence operates by a set of fundamental properties that have existed since the beginning of time. When oppositional particles come into contact, mutual self-destruction ensues. What happened between Will Smith and Chris Rock is also taking place between Russia and Ukraine, Democrat and Republican, theist and atheist, gay and straight, black and white, and all other oppositional constructs we’ve unknowingly created over time. The only difference is that we live in a nuclear age where our existence as a species hangs in the balance. There is no doubt that any country that uses nuclear weapons against another will be met with a swift, opposite and equal “smack” because that’s just the way things work, … even at the subatomic level. However, there is hope! We represent the end result of a 13.8-billion-year-long evolution of “Existence” from its most basic, fundamental particles up to living, breathing, self-aware humans who can amazingly rewrite universal law. Yes, “we” have the innate ability to love each other, end our conflicts, and offer forgiveness instead of mutual self-destruction whenever we happen to collide. Will and Chris know what happened was wrong. You can see it in their faces. Chris never should have made that joke and Will never should have reacted as he did. If both could go back in time, no doubt this “particle collision” never would have taken place. All that remains is whether they can show the world that people can forgive each other when we err and continue to live in peace. These two wonderful individuals can turn a terrible event into a message of love and forgiveness that sets an all-new standard going forward. While we wait on the outcome, our wars will still be waging, our hatred will still be dividing us, our weaponry will still increase in strength, … … and the clock is ticking!"},{"prompt":"Do US soldiers keep their guns?","completion":"No!

Helps greatly in closing gaps in city traffic than the conventional geared bikes.Storage space under the seat.I have seen people use it to transport anything from another person to half the stuff in home.Anybody with cycle balance can ride it, provide that they have throttle control also. Disadvantages : Average fuel efficiency is less than that of similar capacity geared bike.Top speed is less than that of similar capacity geared bike and it's also recommended not to ride at that speeds for long.Not a highway friendly vehicle. Very unstable at crosswinds.Since the engine is located to the rear there is a problem of handlebar becoming heavy when fully loaded. Also makes the scooter is less stable than a bike with engine centrally located.Cannot be ridden from long distance continuously because of engine over heating.Lower capacity fuel tank. (Enough for a 200-250 km trip)The self maintenance is a pain because mostly you will have to open up the whole scooter to access the engine, battery etc.Pricey compared to some 100cc geared bikes.The CVT can be laggy at times.Not comfortable for long rides. Seems like the disadvantages is more than the advantages. I ride an Activa just because I'm not comfortable on a geared bike. In stop and go city traffic a scooter makes most sense to me and for long rides a geared bike wins hands down. Hope this helps.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you clean your faux rabbit fur area rug: Shake out the rug: Take the rug outside and gently shake it to remove any loose dirt, dust, or debris.Vacuum the rug: Use a handheld vacuum or a vacuum with a brush attachment to gently vacuum the rug, starting from one end and working your way to the other. Be sure to use a gentle suction and avoid applying too much pressure, which can damage the fibers.Spot-clean stains: If there are any stains or spills on the rug, spot-clean them using a solution of warm water and mild detergent. Gently blot the stain with a clean, damp cloth until it is removed.Wash the rug: Fill a large sink or bathtub with cool water and add a small amount of mild detergent. Submerge the rug in the water and gently agitate it with your hands. Avoid using a brush or scrubbing the rug, as this can damage the fibers.Rinse the rug: Once the rug has been washed, drain the water and rinse the rug thoroughly with cool water until all of the soap has been removed.Dry the rug: Hang the rug outside or lay it flat on a clean, dry surface to air-dry. Avoid exposing the rug to direct sunlight or heat sources, as this can cause the fibers to shrink or melt.Fluff the rug: Once the rug is dry, use a soft-bristled brush to fluff the fibers and restore its texture. It's important to note that faux rabbit fur rugs can be delicate and may require special care, so always check the care label on your rug for specific cleaning instructions or consult a professional cleaner if you're unsure about the best way to clean your rug."},{"prompt":"Can you tame an older feral cat?","completion":"Yes, but it will take a VERY long time, longer the older the cat. Truly feral cats are naturally afraid humans and anything else that could harm them. That’s how they survive. Only long months, maybe even years, of gentle, trustworthy behavior on your part will relax this wariness. That means no scares from you, no attempts to touch, no confinements, etc. Feed the cat a desired food, calling it each time before you do. Provide a warm bed in cold weather. I use fiberglass baby pig warmer mats from the Farm Supply store in my barn. They have the right amount of warmth and are indestructible. I place a cardboard box or, better, a plastic tote, with one side cut off over one end of the mat. The other end is out in the open. That way, they are sheltered from drafts but do not feel cornered. If you have to set this up outside, provide a shelter with a front and back entrance, so the cat knows it can escape. The cat will soon associate you with the food and shelter. Gradually, over time, it will become used to you perhaps so much that you can touch it. Frankly, this is much more likely in kittens and adolescents. Adults are usually ingrained in their wildness, which after all has kept them alive so far."},{"prompt":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?","completion":"Yes."},{"prompt":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","completion":"We lose the fear of losing anything !"},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"Who doesn't enjoy the thought of making money without exerting any effort? That is the ideal, isn't it? Many people misunderstand affiliate marketing because it appears to be an easy method to make money. They believe that all they need to do is cry \\"Buy now!\\" to attract customers. But let's face it, you won't make much money if you're not providing something worthwhile. My experience as an affiliate marketer has taught me some valuable insights about what generates results and what doesn't. I'll share my observations with you now. 1. Clearly understand your subject. The primary focus of affiliate websites is product or service reviews. What is the main focus of these reviews? Real, useful information. If you aren't familiar with what customers want to know about two products, you can't make detailed comparisons between them. The fact is that you won't be able to offer that kind of insight if you don't have a thorough understanding of the topic. Users are intelligent, and they can tell if you're only partially informed. Sure, a little bit of expertise might trick a few people, but if you're serious about expanding your affiliate site, you must actually be an expert. This is especially true for affiliates in specialized sectors where knowledge is essential, such online gambling (which is a popular field for affiliates). 2. Pick a topic that interests you. You have a big advantage in affiliate marketing, but it may also be a disadvantage. You can advertise anything you want. The difficult part is to not choose a specialty just because it has a high conversion rate or makes you instantly rich. That almost never works out, and you'll probably end yourself writing about something you detest. It's common knowledge that pursuing your passions is a key to success, and affiliate marketing is no exception. 3. Refrain from pursuing extremely competitive keywords. Have you heard of affiliate marketers' \\"Holy Grail\\" keywords? They say things like, \\"Best [insert your niche keyword].\\" I can tell you from personal experience that trying to rank for these is a huge challenge. Depending on your niche and the level of competition therein, the challenge fluctuates. However, choosing keywords wisely and being aware of their intent are the keys to success for affiliate marketers. Using keywords intended to convey information in an article with only transactional intents is a major no-no. Focusing on evaluating new and less well-known products is a wonderful way to avoid highly competitive keywords. Instead of competing for old, difficult keywords, you may start ranking for related keywords right away. 4. Check out potential partners before working together. Let me reveal yet another fact. Not all companies will honor their promises to give you commissions. In particular in the area of online gambling, I have personally witnessed this during my affiliate journey. Certain sectors engage in questionable practices. Therefore, it's essential to conduct in-depth study and obtain information from Affiliate forums. Avoid companies that rip off commissions or have ambiguous or unreasonable terms and conditions.

However, a fall in the value of the currency often leads to higher inflation - which hurts people. For example, with a fall in the value of the rupee, the rupee price of oil goes up, even if the dollar price stays the same. This may lead to an increase in the price of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel. People will notice that. The fall in the value of the rupee will make exports more competitive - because the same rupees as before now mean a lower dollar price. But, this benefits a limited number of people. No doubt Mr. Modi had criticized Mr. Singh when the rupee declined. Now, it’s hurting Mr. Modi. But, these are just talking points, which mean nothing to most people.

Do you think there should be an all female Avengers movie and would you go watch it?","completion":"I wasn’t a fan of A-Force. ( Marvel’s all female Avengers. ) It just felt like the only reason this group of characters was thrown together was because of their gender rather than because they fit together in a way that serves a story. In contrast, I could easily get behind an all female Guardians. Gamora, Nebula, Mantis, Lady Sif, Valkyrie, Captain Marvel, with new additions like Angela, Quasar, and Moon Dragon on a cosmic adventure… Those characters would just work together. They all have agendas which would usually align and sometimes cross one another. Some take things too seriously and others not seriously enough. You have characters trying to forget their pasts on a ship with an empath. I mean… if you want an all female team, start on the cosmic end where you have enough established characters we’re invested in to build the core then pepper in ones which will sometimes compliment and sometimes antagonize the characters we’re already invested in ( or likely will be in the case of Captain Marvel. ) If you can’t picture Lady Sif joining that team. Or Angela Or Moon Dragon ( Drax’s long lost daughter; a psychic martial artist ) Or Phyla-Vell ( who has taken up the mantle of Captain Marvel and is off and on involved with Moon Dragon ) Even though I can’t recall seeing an all-female group of guardians… esp with the versions we’ve seen in the MCU, there would be stories to tell which grow from who these characters are and how they’d play off each other. Similarly on the Netflix end, I’d watch the fuck out of Daughters of the Dragon ( Misty Knight and Colleen Wing. ) They already have a relationship and their skills and experiences compliment each other in a way that can be better than the sum of their parts. On the Avengers end, who do you have. Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, and maybe a member or two from the Dora Milaje? Those characters have so little common ground and shared experience that I just don’t see that feeling like a strong foundation for a team at this point in time."},{"prompt":"here been an increase in UFO activity since the Voyager satellite left our solar system?","completion":"There are two Voyager probes and neither is a satellite.

These are limited to professions with a shortage of workers in Canada — either skilled (doctors, engineers, nurses, specialized trades, etc.) or highly temporary. The later jobs not longer exist due to Covid and massive Canadian unemployment and even the former are difficult to find due to unemployment and the massive number of companies closing, not expanding, or losing money. If you did get a job offer, you can only bring spouses and dependent children with you. So, you can’t bring a brother — unless he is under 18, your parents are dead, and you are his legal guardian. If your brother is 18+, then he would need to apply on his own, meaning he also has a job offer."},{"prompt":"Why do Glocks and HiPoints look like they are rudimentary, and made for people who just want to say they own a gun?","completion":"Exactly what is it you expect a gun to look like?"},{"prompt":"Why did Kavanaugh say that Americans have a right to privacy after protestors ruined his meal at a steak house when he was part of the majority SCOTUS opinion that overturned roe on the basis that the constitution doesn't grant a right to privacy?","completion":"The orange one did not pick the brightest judges."},{"prompt":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","completion":"One cat, a beautiful black and white tuxedo, seems to have gone thru several homes before settling in with us.

We located the home before our neighbor. He spent a month at that place and left because a young child played very rough with him. So rough that when they asked if the child could see he was OK and we said yes, the cat ran under the bed the instant he saw the kid. We know there was at least one home before the “bad kid place”. When we decided to let him live with us, we had him thoroughly checked by our vet. He had been neutered and was around 7 or 8 months old! So there were at least three homes before us. Our neighbor, the bad kid place and the unknown owner. Who had neutered him. Or maybe there were more than three. Our place was his last home. He showed no interest in ever leaving.

Will he forgive me because I feel guilty?","completion":"First of all, Radhekrishn… Coming back to your question, then yes. Seeing to your question one can say, that you had already said sorry for your mistake to Krishna, right. If yes then it's good, and if not yet, say sorry for that, and don't do it again. And also you can admit the mistake infront of someone, because admitting your mistake needs and strength, and feeling guilty is your prashchyatap, and not doing it again, is what you learnt from your mistakes. Anyone is not perfect, all makes mistakes, but the one who learns from it and never repeat it again, is really a good person. So, don't worry, Krishna already pardoned you. Go ahead and a little advice I like to give is, “Before you do something, always first think that it is right or wrong”. If it is right, go ahead, and if you feel it's not right, don't do it, that's it, trust me you will never do anything wrong if you go with this.

So my views on this matter are predictably slanted, but hear me out because I haven't seen this argument made in any of the answers yet. Social Security and Medicare benefits should be doubled, at least. I know, it sounds self-serving, but my concern is not for myself or even for others in my elderly cohort, many of whom depend upon the admittedly meager benefits to survive. My concern is for the Gen-X and millennial generations. How often have you heard younger workers complain that they can't afford to buy a home, or even to rent a livable place because of their reliance on the “gig economy\\"? Their degrees seem worthless because they are barred from access to the most powerful wealth-building tool our society offers: home ownership. Why are they being deprived? Simple -- the older generations are not retiring and making room for them to advance. And why are older workers not retiring? I think you know the answer to this one: they can't afford to retire. That's why I'm still working full-time, even with SS benefits and three pensions between my wife and me. With higher Social Security benefits and more affordable Medicare premiums, I could give up my job, and so could millions of boomers in the same situation. Those higher-paying jobs could go to younger workers who would then leave openings for entry-level workers. As more younger workers advance, they can afford the things they're not buying now, like houses, and the trickle-up economy brings on a huge boom of prosperity. Limiting seniors to miserly benefits is holding back not only seniors, but our entire economy. The very idea that we should actually cut benefits should disqualify any politician from being elected."},{"prompt":"w can I disable security tags from Walmart?","completion":"Well you need a special tool to remove the security tags.

However I would say that the best hotel I have ever stayed at was the Etap Marmara Hotel (as it was known then) in Taksim Square, Istanbul, Turkey, where I stayed for five nights, arriving on Wednesday, 16th September 1981 and departing on Monday, 21st September, as you can see from the card below. I also attach some publicity material for the hotel, which I picked up at the time I stayed there. This is in the form of a free standing card, consisting of two parts which fit inside each other. I had arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday, 16th September 1981 having flown from Heathrow Airport that morning on a Turkish Airlines DC-10 airliner and soon settled into my five night stay at the Etap Marmara. Actually I do not recall a great deal about the hotel and all of its facilities (as advertised in those pictures above) because when I stayed there I just passed through the foyer and slept in my bedroom, spending as much time out and about seeing as much of Istanbul as I could. I would make an early start each morning on day long guided sightseeing tours provided as part of the holiday and then I would go out again to different restaurants and night spots in the evening. On the morning of Monday 21st September I checked out of the hotel and flew with Turkish Airlines to Turkey’s capital city of Ankara, staying there for two nights in the Hotel Dedeman before flying home again on Wednesday, 23rd August. Today the hotel where I stayed in Istanbul all those years ago is known as the Marmara Taksim Hotel and I attach two pictures of it below :- I would guess that maybe it is not quite such a prestigious hotel now as it was back in 1981 when I stayed there, as other hotels will have opened in the meantime, or been upgraded. Perhaps someone who has been to Istanbul more recently or stayed in this particular hotel can add a comment on this. Anyway, you might well be wondering how I could afford to stay at a place like this when I did, but to let you into a little secret. I was not paying for it, because that whole week long trip to Turkey was a prize I had won in a competition. In those days one of my hobbies was listening to international short wave broadcast from the various countries of the world, and one station I listened to was the Voice of Turkey. The competition was one in which listeners were invited to write an essay about the founder of the modern Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. I was very surprised to learn that my essay was one of the ten winning entries, and so I and all of the other winners were invited to spend an all expense week in Turkey, staying in Istanbul and Ankara. When I went I was accompanied by three other prizewinners – one from the U.K., one from France and one from Germany, and we became friends and got to know each other really well too. The remaining six prizewinners visited the following month. Even 37 years later now, I rate this week’s visit to Turkey as the best prize I have ever won in my entire life, because I have never been a great winner of prizes. I should say in conclusion that I have never returned to Istanbul (or Ankara) since that visit in 1981, and though I did return to Turkey it was not until 33 years later in 2014, this time flying to Antalya on the Mediterranean coast and going by coach to the surreal landscapes of Cappadocia. I was glad to have the opportunity to visit Cappadocia at last, because I had heard that the other party of prizewinners back in 1981 had been taken to Cappadocia whereas my party had not, so I had always felt rather envious of them. Also when I went to Cappadocia I enjoyed an experience that none of those prizewinners did, because I had a hot air balloon ride."},{"prompt":"What happens if a person who orders pizza takes the pizza and refuses to pay?","completion":"He will have to run away .... there is sequential system of managers ,they will kick the delivery boy (...)...... so he will run after the thief as i think, also my words might be just craps ...."},{"prompt":"Which is the best ethical hacking course?","completion":"Hi, You can checkout this course.This course includes Practicals too, So you can easily understand everything.

I’m greatly intrigued by the widespread belief in the myth that the UK paid for Lend-Lease (and sometimes even the Marshall Plan). It’s fascinating that a modern people could believe in such legends. What they paid for were post-war loans from the US and Canada; indeed, anything they chose to keep AFTER the war that originated from Lend-Lease was rolled into these loans - at 10% of its production cost. [LINKED_TEXT: Anglo-American loan - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Loan from the US to the UK after World War II Signature of the loan. Bottom row from left: economist John Maynard Keynes , leader of the British negotiators; Lord Halifax , British Ambassador to the US ; James F. Byrnes , United States Secretary of State ; and Fred M. Vinson , United States Secretary of the Treasury . Future US Secretary of State Dean Acheson stands third from right in the back row. The Anglo-American Loan Agreement was a loan made to the United Kingdom by the United States on 15 July 1946, enabling its economy after the Second World War to keep afloat. [1] The loan was negotiated by British economist John Maynard Keynes and American diplomat William L. Clayton . Problems arose on the American side, with many in Congress reluctant, and with sharp differences between the treasury and state departments. The loan was for 3.75 billion at a low 2% interest rate; Canada loaned an additional US1.19 billion. The British economy in 1947 was hurt by a provision that called for convertibility into dollars of the wartime sterling balances the British had borrowed from India and others, but by 1948, the Marshall Plan included financial support that was not expected to be repaid. The entire loan was paid off in 2006, after it was extended six years. Background [ edit ] At the start of the war, Britain had spent the money that she did have in normal payments for materiel under the \\"US cash-and-carry \\" scheme. Basing rights were also traded for equipment, e.g., the Destroyers for Bases Agreement , but by 1941 Britain was no longer able to finance cash payments and Lend-Lease was introduced. The Lend Lease Act provided aid for free on the basis that such help was essential for the defense of the United States. Congress passed the final extension of the act on April 16th, 1945, extending the aid for another year while adding an amendment stating that no aid could be provided for postwar relief or reconstruction. Large quantities of goods were in Britain or in transit when the Lend Lease Act was terminated on 21 August 1945. The British economy had been heavily geared towards war production (constituting 55% of GDP in 1944) and had drastically reduced its exports. [2] The UK therefore relied on Lend-Lease imports to obtain essential consumer commodities such as food while it could no longer afford to pay for these items using export profits. The end of Lend-Lease thus came as a great economic shock. Britain needed to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. As a result, the Anglo-American loan came about. Lend-lease items retained were sold to Britain at the knockdown price of about 10 cents on the dollar, giving an initial value of £1.075 billion.

He made his own way out to the frontier (the Western Reserve) and worked to support himself, all the while educating himself. When he returned to Pennsylvania a few years later, he badgered the school system to let him take an equivalency exam to get his diploma, which they didn’t want to grant. He passed it flawlessly. He fought in the Civil War, re-upping when he didn’t have to, and fought at Antietam. He then apprenticed to a pharmacist (called a druggist in those days), and became so respected as to be one of only five in his profession in the entire state to be granted the use of the title “Doctor”. Later in life he personally rescued the public library of his town when the previous library head absconded with the library’s money.

Additionally, the physiques of actors like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel are often the result of a combination of genetics, intense training, and strict dieting. While elite soldiers and Navy SEALs undergo rigorous physical training, they typically have different priorities and goals than professional bodybuilders or actors preparing for a role.

Few years ago, if you would have asked me to date a girl from my class, I would have dated the most beautiful girl in my class without a second thought. There was a time I was an admirer of beauty. Intially, at the start of a friendship or a relationship everything was damn exciting. But, gradually, the more beauty I consumed the least interesting it used to become. Beauty has a limit on how much it can serve and entertain other people. Once you have served everything you have, there's nothing else that you can bring forth. After a certain period of time, your beauty isn't exciting, it becomes repetitive and rusty thus making it useless for you to use it as a weapon to sharp your personality. But, there's one weapon that never gets rusty, borning, repitive and unexciting. Your Brain. My advice is that rather than investing money and time for your beauty, invest for your brain. I am not asking you to roam like a witch.(Pun Intended). It is totally upto you how you want to look. But, I'm asking you to set your priorities right. And your priority should be sharpening your brain, not your beauty. May be instead of Maybelline New York or L’oreal Paris products, you can go with other cheaper options to save a lot of money.

In addition to online travel agencies and airlines' official websites, there are also[LINKED_TEXT: several travel hacking strategies and rewards programs] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/wayaway-the-ultimate-cheap-flight-hack/] that can help you save money on flights. In this article, we'll explore some of these options and provide tips for finding the best deals. Travel Hacking Travel hacking is the practice of using various travel strategies and tactics to save money on flights, hotels, and other travel expenses. One of the most [LINKED_TEXT: popular travel hacking strategies] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/wayaway-the-ultimate-cheap-flight-hack/] for finding cheap flights is to use credit card rewards points. Many credit card companies offer rewards programs that allow you to earn points or miles for purchases, which can then be redeemed for flights or other travel expenses. To maximize your rewards points, it's important to choose the right credit card for your travel needs. Look for cards that offer bonus points for travel purchases or sign-up bonuses that can give you a head start on earning points. It's also important to stay organized and keep track of your rewards points, so you can use them before they expire. Another travel hacking strategy for finding cheap flights is to use airline alliances to your advantage. Many airlines are part of larger alliances, such as Star Alliance or OneWorld, which allows travelers to earn and redeem miles on multiple airlines. By strategically booking flights on different airlines within the same alliance, you can [LINKED_TEXT: earn more miles and potentially save money on flights] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/wayaway-the-ultimate-cheap-flight-hack/]. 2.

These programs allow you to earn miles or points for flights or other purchases, which can then be redeemed for free or discounted flights. To maximize your rewards program benefits, it's important to choose the right program for your travel needs. [LINKED_TEXT: Look for programs that offer generous rewards for frequent flyers] [URL: https://beyondexpatlife.com/wayaway-the-ultimate-cheap-flight-hack/], as well as programs that have partnerships with other airlines or travel providers.

It's also important to book your flights well in advance, as prices tend to go up as the travel date approaches. However, it's also important to be aware of last-minute deals and flash sales, which can sometimes offer significant discounts on flights. Finally, it's important to compare prices across multiple platforms and airlines before booking. While it may be tempting to book the first cheap flight you find, taking the time to compare prices can often save you even more money in the long run.

Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"You know the funniest thing is that it is impossible to know. Every person answering this question is making a comparison that is impossible to make. For example “with a high IQ think a LOT faster”… how could you ever know? You cannot compare your mind to other people’s because you’ll never know how they think… You’re bound to your own, single perception… That being said, from my own experience as someone who was an IQ of around 150, it’s absolute bull shit. Never helped me a day in my life. Live life to your fullest potential by hard work and determination, don’t let a man-made test limit the boarders of possibility and likewise don’t let such a test inflate your boarders so wide that you become too comfortable and never put in the effort it takes to truly live and accomplish your dreams."},{"prompt":"f Java is not good for 3D games, then why is Minecraft still using Java and not recreated in C++?","completion":"Question: If Java is not good for 3D games, then why is Minecraft still using Java and not recreated in C++? First that premise is not technically correct - Java is not bad for 3D games - It’s bad for 3D games requiring quick refresh rates like GTA or a fighting game like Doom or Hexen. Because Java has issues with speed, it doesn’t handle refresh too well. I rewrote PacMan in Java using Swing and that’s just a 2D game so I could handle 60 fps but if that was rewritten using 3D with 3D model and material textures and shading and stuff, then that would push the limits especially if you have particle effects like fire and explosions and waterfalls and stuff like that. Minecraft - I’ve never played but my understanding from seeing YouTube Videos on the game are that it doesn’t involve that high refresh rates so it can be coded probably even in Python as speed is not essential for mere 3D programming."},{"prompt":"Which Turkic country has the purest Turks?","completion":"There is no purest anything.

There are many enduring guitar designs, but none that are still as popular and useful. Its funny too, because there have been many improvements and variants of the design, yet the most popular ones that are those closest to the original model. What really pushes the Strat over the top is its versatility. It is ergonomically comfortable, relatively inexpensive even for good quality models, it can be used for just about any genre requiring an electric guitar. They are also very reliable. If they had any drawback it was that the single coil picks had a lot of noisy hum at high volumes. The humbucking pickups in Gibson guitars have allowed Gibson to give the Strat a run for its money, but many people are willing to put up with the “hum” to get the unique tones that only a Strat can provide. Fender has since been able to capture the same tone in a noiseless pick up, so what more can you ask for?"},{"prompt":"What is your opinion of Adam Schiff presenting indisputable evidence that the Trump campaign did in fact collude with Russia and criticising the GOP?","completion":"My opinion is that he is lower than toenail fungus.

I mean, there is something called loyalty in relationship or friendship. When people lack that and show up when required, then I start to think why do they do that. Though I don't expect any good from anyone, but continue to be good to others. Still there is a feeling that arise inside me which frequently ask this question."},{"prompt":"Who is the best email campaign management vendor out there?","completion":"Well, you see there are number of such vendor in the market who are just experts (I can’t call them anything less than that) in managing email campaigns. However, being an individual I can speak about only the tool that I have used and still using for carrying out email marketing campaigns. One such tool would be EasySendy Pro, which our marketing team is using and they are, well highly benefited with the usage of this tool. This is a hybrid technology based tool, which means emails can be sent through this tool after connecting it or integrating it to a SMTP server. This is the exact method we use to send emails through EasySendy Pro. There are number of SMTP servers that are already present inside Pro. The users will have to choose one or more SMTP servers of their choice and connect it with Pro. Once done with the integration process, users will be able to send emails to the subscribers. Apart from that. this tool is an expert at sending bulk emails to the subscribers as this tool is infused with micro deliverability technology ([LINKED_TEXT: The Concept of Micro-Deliverability in Email Marketing] [URL: https://easysendy.com/blog/the-concept-of-micro-deliverability-in-email-marketing/]), which makes sure that the emails land straight into the subscriber’s inbox.

Apart from that, it is superbly cost effective tool that does not even burns the users pocket. One can [LINKED_TEXT: optimise email marketing budget] [URL: https://easysendy.com/blog/optimize-email-marketing-budget/] with the use of this tool. In fact, Pro follows the policy ‘pay-per-email’ which makes it a very viable tool.

I mean, the two weren’t particularly discreet about it. They shared a luxury apartment together in Coruscant like, right next to the Jedi Temple. It seemed obvious that Anakin lived there with Padme, not just making nightly booty calls. Padme wasn’t some random nobody, she was one of the most prominent senators, she was a noblewoman with an entourage. Her entourage must know. And people gossip. And even “the dark side cloud everything” blah blah blah, the Jedi masters surely hear rumors. Ashoka knew. Pretty sure Obi-Wan knew. I think the Jedi Council chose to ignore it because 1) Anakin was a highly capable, well regarded general, and was needed for the Clone war effort. 2) Anakin wasn’t just married to a nobody, he was married to one of the most prominent senators, the Jedi Council didn’t want to piss off Padme. 3) I think most importantly, the Jedi council, Yoda, or Windu, they just didn’t know how to approach this without some massive repercussions from Anakin and Padme, both immensely powerful during the Clone Wars. So they turned their heads and pretend nothing happened. Besides, Jedi's teaching was against attachment, I guess Yoda and Windu be like “who knows, maybe Anakin and Padme are just friends with benefits. That’s not against the law, right?” This is why I think Yoda was a horrible mentor. He obviously knew Anakin was in love with Padme. Everyone could see that. Anakin wasn’t very good at hiding his feelings towards Padme. And when Anakin came to Yoda to discuss his paranoia about Padme’s death, Yoda gave him some surface-level advice about attachment, basically telling him to “touch it up”. He didn’t offer Anakin any actual help or actionable advice. If he realized anything after Mustafar, I sure hope he realized how horrible a teacher he was, and he had utterly failed at pretty much everything a Jedi Master should be doing: mentoring, leading, detecting the dark side… … Nope. Probably not. Judging from his initial attitude towards Luke, Yoda was too arrogant to learn anything. In short: Yoda sucks."},{"prompt":"What is the political leaning of MSNBC's Morning Joe show?","completion":"He’s a born and bred CORRUPTACRAT!!!"},{"prompt":"w much money can you make online?","completion":"I launched my blog in July 2021, peaked at over 63,000 views in January and first started consistently monetizing in April 2022, earning about 1,000 per month for the past 3 months.

Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well?

They certainly sidestep the problem of liquid fuels that can go bad in storage and eventually damage the engine (eg gasoline). One down side of natural gas vs diesel or gasoline, is that they do not produce the same power on natural gas. I’ve seen a few that had a NG rating that was half that of liquid fuels.

While preparation : 1.

GATE do not repeat questions but repeats logic. So the questions have to be revised again and again. 2. Leave few topics or even subject: Due to vast syllabus of GATE few students leave few topics or chapters. Which are not very important. This is a conclusion based on analysis that from these topics very rarely question in asked but that's not a good practice . As GATE might surprise you asking 2 easy questions from that topic. 3. Do not solve relevant questions : normally student refer books from Any publication and do not go to relevant content for practice.

Here’s a graph of U.S. debt since 1939. The first blue line is of the presidencies of FDR and Truman. Debt was increased during WW2, which I say is a good justification for a debt increase, then declined until the Korean war. It would decline further after the Korean war. The first red line is the Eisenhower presidency. The debt declined overall, nothing special here. The next blue line is JFK and LBJ. The debt continues to decrease despite the Vietnam War and Great Society programs. The next red line is Nixon and Ford. Debt as a percent of GDP remains stable. Jimmy Carter is the smallest blue line and debt stays at the same place. Ronald Reagan is important. He is the start of the republicans not caring about the debt. Big tax decreases combined with much more military spending led to triple the amount of debt as before his presidency. George H. W. Bush continued these debt increasing policies until recession hit. Bill Clinton increased taxes and stopped spending so much, a budget surplus was the result. George W. Bush decided to give the surplus, “back to the American people” and cut taxes. The Afghanistan War (justified) and Iraq War (unjustified) did not stop him from decreasing taxes one the rich further despite how important the Iraq war was. Barack Obama increased taxes mildly and the deficit did not go away, but it did decrease. And now Donald Trump. His tax plan is more giveaways to the rich with a deficit that doubled in 1 year. The biggest differences pre-Reagan and post-Reagan was Keynesian economics. It was the economic theory that you spend in recession and save in an expansion. With that theory, America had debt decreases every year until the 1970s. I will admit that Supply-Side economics worked temporarily, but it only works for short periods of time before it only benefits the rich while Keynesian is in it for the long haul. The Republican party only wants cuts while the Democratic party is the party of money saving."},{"prompt":"w would you describe each Stray Kids member in one word?","completion":"okie dokie lets get it- ✨❤️ Bang Chan❤️✨ OIyep that about sums it up ✨❤️ Lee Know❤️✨ CatHe has cats, He looks like a cat, He is cat ✨❤️Changbin ❤️✨ ThickMy mans was on the skinny side but now he THICKThis is a good thing ✨❤️ Hyunjin ❤️✨ Dramahe looks like that one person in movies who is savage but everyone loves himthe faces he be makin says Drama King…….we stanthen again he is very dramatic ✨❤️ Han❤️✨ cheekslike my mans cheeks be poppinSO FLUFFY ✨❤️ Felix❤️✨ Memethis guy is a living memeknows all the current memesis quietly stalking us on the internet (along with Bang Chan) ✨❤️ Seungmin❤️✨ softboyHe looks so softhe can be so calmI wanna hugggggg ✨❤️ I.N ❤️✨ lifehear me outWhen i.n was a baby When I.N was a child When I.N was a teenager When I.N was a adult When I.N was old He is the process of life ✨-Started on my ambitions-✨ -LuXun loves you"},{"prompt":"Why do people vape?","completion":"To be honest it's helps me with to deal with my stress and I did since I was 13 now soon I'll be 19 next month"},{"prompt":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","completion":"I will keep it simple.

Let's name him Sagar. So Sagar, a 45 years old man, is living with his friends in Surat. They also work together in a factory. Drinking alcohol and smoking after coming from the factory is not new for them. They do it almost everyday. Sagar also enjoys his life to the fullest with his roommates cum friends. One day at the time of enjoying their life on their building roof they decided to do some TOOFANI. One suggested to jump from the building, and another suggested to rape a lady who stays in the same building. But finally one suggested, \\"Let's put this steel glass into one of our anuses.\\" Everyone jumped happily by listening to this unique and innovative idea.. What else can be the best way to enjoy life with friends! They all tried with themselves but couldn't. Then asked Sagar. He shyly agreed to take the challenge. All were getting drunk. Their brains already stopped working. All the zombies finally inserted a steel glass in a zombie named Sagar's anus. It was obviously painful but how they say \\"anything for friends\\". Task over. They slept. In the morning, when Sagar turned a human from a zombie he realised what had happened with his last night. He tried by himself to pull out the glass, but couldn't. He then thought let it be in my anus, what's the big deal. After two days he returned to his home because of his unbearable stomach pain, but being ashamed he did not say anyone in his family about it. Six days have passed. That glass is in his stomach now. He couldn't poop and his stomach became a pumpkin by then. He is still not telling anyone about the exact reason, not even to doctors and consuming medicines after medicines prescribed by doctors. On the eighth day, which means 19th August, his family members admitted him to the hospital. When the doctor x-rayed them they found out this. Source: screenshot of a newspaper. At first doctors tried their best to get out of the glass through his anus, meaning the way it was inserted. Since the glass has already reached his upper stomach, they failed to pull it out as they planned. So they had to operate on him. Operation was not easy because they had to cut his alimentary tract (food passage). It continued for around two long hours. By the grace of God, the operation was successful. He is fine now. As I said, it's not a story, it's a real incident that happened a week ago. The news was also published in an Odia daily yesterday, the screenshot I had posted above. Now let's come to the question: what is the real meaning of friendship? Friendship is not about drinking, flirting with girls or watching movies together. It doesn't even mean inserting glass in a friend's anus. Real friendship is when one cares for his/her friends more than joking. You don't need to act crazy or behave nuts in the name of friendship. You can be a friend with a mature mind. When a friend forces you to do or not do something, it is best to stay away from that friend. The issue is that we all know what's right and wrong, but we can't distinguish when we're in the middle of it. After meeting with your friends, analyse what you did when you were with your friends. You can continue the friendship if you don't think you did anything harmful to yourself, your future or anyone else."},{"prompt":"f you agree with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan that its time to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because the deficit has skyrocketed, what percentage of cut to each program would you support?","completion":"First, let them cut their own pensions and other retirement benefits.

So here I go. Sorry for cheating. 2011- 16yo I was young and had a baby face. I couldn't gros a beard and didn't even imagine what I wanted to do in life. 2012–17yo I was taking my independence, starting to make some life changing decisions. 2012 was the year I started to be called “sir” by teenagers younger than me. It was the year I broke up with my first girlfriend ever, so it was a kind of a shock. And every shock leads to a reaction that is proportionnally equal. It led to 2013… 2013 - 18yo It was the year I got my first tattoo, and had my last holidays for a long time. I shaved my head for no fucking reason. And it looked awkward as hell. In November I decided to start stretching my left ear, so I did it, and kept going on the way I wanted to. At the end of 2013 I had really changed. I had two tattoos while I didn’t at the beginning of 2013. I had change my field of studies. I pierced my ear. It was a shock for my parents. They didn’t understand what I was doing. 2014 - 19yo I met Jared Leto and my girlfriend of this time. It was a real change in my life. It really was a moment of truth for me (for many reasons). Well it wasn’t holidays, it was just a week-end on tour with a great band (Thirty Seconds To Mars). As you can see on those three pictures, I look way older than in the previous pictures. I don’t know if it is the beard, or just my face getting sharper, but I stopped looking my age during this period of time. 2015 - 20yo I kept changing. I started to go the gym and kept it this way for a year, but it didn’t really change me whatever I could do. This year I started looking more professional and more adult. The way I was clothed, and maybe my attitude changed it. My beard was getting thicker and thicker. 2016 - 21 yo I dyed my hair blond for a while, and here is what it looked like ! I also adopted this haircut that everybody seemed to have, even if I couldn’t admit it :( And here it is. Me, right now. I try to grow a stache to see how it looks like on me. And I keep getting tattooed, because that’s part of me. I don’t know in which way I’ve really changed, but I feel way better with my body right now, that I felt 5 years ago. It has made me more confident, more authentic, and more me. I’ve been through a lot of things and I think that all those changes can be seen on me through those pictures. In 2011 I was a teenager and had no idea what my life could be made of, and now I’m trying to secure my future and to live as much as possible. I find myself more attractive now than before, even though I try not to be arrogant about this feeling.

Or GIGO from the mathematical standpoint. The garbage in is the presumption that one, and only one amino acid sequence (protein) can do a job. That is totally false. Cytochrome c is an essential protein for metabolism. But look at the chart at this site: [LINKED_TEXT: Biological Molecules 6: An introduction to molecular biology and evolution] [URL: http://biologicalphysics.iop.org/cws/article/lectures/47042] It shows how many different amino acid sequences (cytochrome c’s) can do that job. And all of these sequences do so equally well. Now imagine all the sequences that could do the job almost as well, then imagine all the sequences that can do the job OK, then all the sequences that would be less than OK but still not bad, then all the sequences that could do the job just a little bit. It might help you to think of the game of bridge. Calculate the odds of getting any particular bridge hand. It is very small. But you don’t need a particular bridge hand to play bridge, do you? Any hand will do. Deal out 13 cards to each player and you have a playable bridge hand. Pretty much the same applies to proteins. Make proteins by thermally heating them and each protein will have a biological activity. We won’t know which one, but it will have one. Probably 2 or more (since many proteins have 2 enzymatic activities or are an enzyme and a membrane protein). With tRNAs, there are lots of RNA configurations. All of them will have tri-nucleotides that can potentially bind mRNA and there is nothing mysterious in having an amino acid bind to the 3′ end. Initially, the 3 loop configuration would not be necessary. People have looked at the evolution of tRNAs. One paper is: 4. Margaret E. Saks, Jeffrey R. Sampson, John Abelson Evolution of a transfer RNA gene through a point mutation in the anticodon. Science, 279, Number 5357 Issue of 13 March 1998, pp. 1665 - 1670. Once you get to the point of having just a little activity, then natural selection makes it a virtual certainty that, eventually, you will get a very efficient protein or tRNA. Natural selection cuts down odds. It is important to remember that natural selection is cumulative. Let me give you are very simple example: You have a 1 in 1024 chance of correctly winning 10 coin tosses in a row. But I can guarantee you I can find someone who can do so. How? Simple, use cumulative selection in the form of a single elimination tournament. I start with 1024 people and pair them up. Then each pair tosses a coin. The 512 winners are selected to go to the next round. Again they are paired and do a coin toss; the 256 winners are selected to go to the next round. Repeat this 7 more times. Now you have 2 people who have won 9 coin tosses in a row. The winner of this round has won 10 coin tosses in a row. And it is a certainty that such a person will be found with this method. We have taken odds of 1 in 1024 and converted that into virtual certainty. Now, I don't know which individual will win the tosses, but it is certain that one of them will, given the algorithm of the competition. Evolution by natural selection is a competition algorithm, more complex but analogous to the single elimination tournament algorithm. It converts long odds to virtual certainty."},{"prompt":"w can I get a free Hotstar membership?","completion":"Yes, You can do it, sounds creazy but their are some simple steps to get an premium accounts.

It was a real tearjerker, an amazing touching movie which is a must-watch, and a beautiful tribute to Sushant.

In keeping with the tradition of American freedom to think independently as noted here with a Thomas Jefferson quote from 1802 in a letter to the Baptist Bishops of Danbury CT. The Bishops were intent on making the Baptist Church the default religion of the new “Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \\"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\\" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.” Freedom of religion is a great deal more that deciding what god one may or may not believe in; it is the freedom to think independently, to hold with value those opinions that may differ from others or from government as opposed to a government sponsored and centered belief, which in itself may become intellectually stifling and oppressive to the imaginative mind. Freedom of Religion is also freedom from a religious mandate to believe or to hold one religious belief above all others. The definition of religion is simply the claim that my belief is of “supreme importance” which may also apply to that secular or political ideology and even to that atheistic belief or opinion that gods do not exist. Religious belief is not exclusive to the supernatural, but, rather, inclusive of all opinion. As an Atheist, my Atheism is my opinion of life and living, my religious belief, and I consider it of “supreme Importance” to me, and do I believe that others should think the same, yes, I do. Do I believe that I should make or force others to believe as I do, no. Hopefully there will come a day, in keeping with the thought, the wish and the dream of Martin Luther King, that we are judged not by the god one may or may not belief in, ”—- but by the content of their character.” “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” Martin Luther King, Jr. To respond directly to the question of what religion is best for America and in keeping with the definition of religion as something of supreme importance, I would say that the American Constitution is, by far, the best religion for Americ"},{"prompt":"My mom says cigarette smoke can reprogram cells in your airways, causing COPD to hang on after smoking ends.

Too many people have too many reasons on what to do and when. I hate this, because getting pregnant creates the next generation of the human race. If a woman wants an abortion, then I agree she has the right to have the elective surgery to remove a growing portion of her body, like an appendix or a kidney. Until the umbilical cord connecting the fetus to her body is cut the fetus is a part of her body. Therefore she can do anything she wants to it, including bashing in the skull as long as the umbilical cord is not cut. The moment it is cut the fetus becomes a human being with rights to survive. HOWEVER, since it is “Her body, her choice,” I do not want to pay for her abortion. I want the next generation to be born. I want the human race to continue to exist. SO, if a woman wants an abortion to terminate the results of an act she chose to do, she should pay for the elective surgery to eliminate the growth that is a part of her body. If she cannot pay for it herself, then she can get a charity to help her raise the money to pay for her elective surgery, HOWEVER I do not want to pay for her elective surgery when I do not agree with her desires to eliminate the fetus. THEREFORE, NO CHARITY should get any federal funds to destroy a part of her body in an elective surgery. She got pregnant by her choice, she should pay to stop her choice. She can get an abortion paid for by the government is she was raped or is the victim of incest. HOWEVER she must press charges with the police and the courts to get an abortion. The rapist must pay for his crime. If she lies to get the abortion, she should be prosecuted for theft of funds.

De feu celeste au Royal edifice, Quand la Lumiere du Mars deffaillira, Sept mois grand’ guerre, mort gent de malefice, Rouen, Evreux, au Roy ne faillira. Celestial fire on the Royal edifice, When the light of Mars fails, Seven months the Great War, people dead of evil-doing, Rouen, Evreux shall not fall to the King. Clearly the most enigmatic line is the second, which seems to contain an opportunity to date the quatrain by reference to a heavenly sign. Quand la Lumiere du Mars deffaillira, The term when ‘Mars failing’ suggests a situation in which Mars goes in to retrograde. This will happen on September 11th this year. There are two events that will take place, Covid-19 has mutated into a more deadly strain and will end up killing millions of people around the world from September to April 2021 (7 months).World War 3 (7 months). Because these are happening within the same time period, America will be most vulnerable during this time. This Great war is said to last seven months, so it will probably end in a nuclear conflict between Capitalism and it’s allies on the one side and communism and its allies on the other. The Asian subcontinent is already a “powder keg” waiting to explode. Some authors have attributed this Prophecy to World War 1. The continuing collapse of the Ottoman Empire coincided with the rise of nationalism in the Balkans, which led to increased tensions and conflicts in the region. This “powder keg” was thus a major catalyst for the outbreak of World War I. There were a number of overlapping claims to territories and spheres of influence between the major European powers, such as the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire and, to a lesser degree, the Ottoman Empire, the United Kingdom, and Kingdom of Italy. Within these nations, there were movements to create “greater” nations: to enlarge the boundaries of the state beyond those areas where the national ethnic group was in the majority (termed irredentism). Israel’s annexation plan for occupied West Bank is a “powder keg” in the Middle East waiting to explode, in a bid to a make a Greater Israel. This is precisely what we see with China also, making excessive maritime claims in the South China Sea over disputed territories, challenging “freedom of navigation” and more recently extending its claims to a territory on land disputed by both China and India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh sector. At the heart of the matter is that since early May the Chinese side had been amassing a large contingent of troops and armaments along the LAC. If Pakistan gets dragged into the conflict, Kashmir and Lahore will become disputed territories of a Greater India, than it won’t just be ambers, we’re looking at a situation starting with a minor incident that could spiral out of control with an all out nuclear confrontation. With the Intermediate-Range (INF) Treaty having expired in August, 2019 and the New Start Long-Range Nuclear Treaty expiring on Feb 5, 2021, we could have a nuclear arms race starting in September and ending in April 2021. History is simply repeating itself, we haven’t learnt our lessons from history. The great sixteenth-century French astrologer Morin de Villefranche, who was born 17 years after Nostradamus died, continued the medieval tradition of astrology by insisting that retrograde planets had an action contrary to their direct effects. This is to say that the strong planet Mars would be weak (defaillier) when retrograde. Morin was merely summarizing the astrological beliefs with which Nostradamus was familiar. “ How does this tradition of a retrogradation apply to the astrological conditions surrounding the events of the First World War? The retrogra¬ dation of Mars occurred only twice during the long period of this war. In the first instance, Mars went retrograde on January 1, 1916, and returned to direct motion on March 22, 1916. It was in direct motion for just over two years, until February 4, 1918, when once again it went retrograde. It was during the second period of retrograde motion, precisely as Nostradamus had foreseen, that the Long Max cannons began to project celestial fire on Paris. However, the fact of the retrogradation of Mars ties in with the Sept mois grand’guerrofine three. The extraordinary fact is that after the retrogradation of Mars there remains only a period of seven months to the end of the war. The period between the ending of the retrograde motion of Mars, on April 26, 1918, and the Armistice, on November 11,1918, is actually 6 months and 15 days. May we take it as a sign of the genius of Nostradamus that he should use the very same term to describe this human conflict (grand*guerre) is those who participated in it? Until a further period of reciprocal destruction reduced this conflict to the status of the First World War, it was always referred to as the Great War. Such is the extraordinary power of Nostradamus' vision that he was able to perceive a cosmic event which would parallel (not cause, we venture to emphasize) a period in the first of the wars he predicts for this century."},{"prompt":"f you tell a taxi or Uber driver to just drive, where will they go?","completion":"Nowhere.

Am I missing something very obvious?","completion":"I've seen a lot of excellent answers, but they've not given Little Finger enough credit. He was one of the three most intelligent and sly male characters in Westeros. There are several reasons he gave Sansa to Bolton. Yes, in his mind, to make her claim more legitimate. The longer she stayed by Robin, the more likely people would pair them together. Sansa's claim would then go down in value. It would go to Robin, her eventual husband. He is her relation. He has bannermen. He could rule in Winterfell once Ramsey was defeated. He could tell Robin liked Sansa and the natural pairing by the people wasn't what he wanted.There was a chance Bolton could fall to Stannis and Sansa would then be free of him. Sansa then would be ideally placed in Winterfell. And Little Finger could marry her, or that was his plan.Bolton could kill Sansa like he did the rest of the Starks. No one is thinking about this aspect of Little Finger. He is in love with Sansa. He wants her for himself. But he wants the throne more. Remember, he loved Katelyn, but he set about to have Bran killed. Realistically, he knew Bolton's chance of keeping Winterfell was slim. Eventually he would fall. Either by hands internally because he was so brutal. Or because too many were gunning for him externally- the Northmen, Stannis, Cersei, and eventually Dany with her dragons. He knew Bolton's days were numbered. Sansa may live. Or she may not. If she does, and Robin mysteriously died too *gasp*, then Little Finger would be the lone survivor in the North “loyal” to both King's Landing and his bannermen. He was ideally placed. He looked at the chessboard and thought, place piece called “Sansa” here.Last reason, Little Finger thought there's a chance he could sweep in and save Sansa like he did in the battle between Jon and Bolton. And then Sansa would see him as a savior. But he miscalculated. Little Finger was a brothel owner. He married Katelyn's sister. He was used to breaking women. But he miscalculated with Kate and Sansa. They're Starks. And they know how to weather the hard winters and become strong. “You taught me well,” Sansa tells Little Finger before she has him executed."},{"prompt":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test?

They took great risks so some one else wouldn’t have to take an even greater risk. Plus when you’re the fastest in the air and every one was running scared when you turned up is a massive ego trip which gave them more courage (less thought for consequences), which was probably enhanced by the “boys club” attitude at the RAF and hearing back all the horror stories from the front and from the German bombing raids.

Sunrise. It’s very beautiful from our east window; it’s daybreak! A different time depending on what time of year it is. Right now it’s getting later and later. We couldn’t see anything, however, for the past week due to several wildfires burning east of us. The Bolt Creek fire started on September 10th, 2022, and has burned almost 15,000 acres. They wouldn’t put it out for over a month because everyone was making too much money off it. And now the developers can invade and start building their big housing monstrosities, because the trees are gone. All those who moved to Snohomish and Index and all those towns over there to get away from it all can expect overpopulation. And everything that comes with it. Traffic, crime, higher taxes and on and on… Our air quality in Seattle, usually perfect, was globally the worst. Worse than all of China or New Delhi, India. It was deemed hazardous, and must have gone to the rating below that. They wouldn’t tell us what that was. People were getting hoarse voices, headaches, and eye problems. Terrible for asthmatic people. I apparently have acute bronchospasm. And my doctor wouldn’t refill my prescription for my rescue inhaler unless I made an appointment and went to his office in the smoke. So, I did without. Even though the smoke was in our house!

Take a look at the comparison of JIO MEET with the ZOOM application What's Similar There are a couple of similarities between JioMeet and Zoom. Firstly, the design of the two video conferencing platforms. JioMeet has a simple interface and looks a lot similar to Zoom. While Zoom presents a light blue color, JIO MEET highlights a dark blue shade. Both JioMeet and Zoom support direct calls, including 1:1 calls as well as large groups of up to 100 participants. One of the reasons for Zoom's popularity is because it provides numerous enterprise-grade host controls. Zoom offering settings where participants can enter a meeting only if the host permits him to. Similar features can be found on JioMeet as well. Further, both JioMeet and Zoom are free to up, at least up to 100 participants in a group. The meetings can be password-protected and both have the waiting room feature. The meetings can be held in HD quality as well. What’s Different There are a couple of features that are exclusive to JioMeet. Reliance notes that the JioMeet app can support multi-device login support, on up to five devices, and you can seamlessly switch between devices while on a call. As the exclusive feature, JioMeet includes Safe Driving Mode to allow users to continue their meeting en route. One of the major concerns about Zoom is its security infrastructure. Both on the app and the web, there were many instances of a security lapse. Incidents of ‘Zoom bombing', where persons unrelated to the group meet were spotted regularly. Further, Zoom introduced end-to-end encryption, but it came with a catch. Zoom noted that only paid users would get the best security of the platform, while free users wouldn't. Nevertheless, Zoom introduced a couple of security upgrades, but there were unsatisfactory. Moreover, a lot of organizations and governments advised people to avoid using Zoom. With JioMeet in the picture, there's still a lot we don't know about the platform. As JioMeet is now available to the public, we'll know how it operates and more about its functionality. For now, JioMeet seems like the go-to option against Zoom, especially because it comes as an Indian alternative.

Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","completion":"Because Hinduism inherently institutionalizes the discrimination by the caste system in most inhuman ways. One can not be a Hindu until he/she belongs to a certain caste. Ambedkar tried to reform Hinduism in his younger days, but he realized that his efforts are futile as upper caste Hindus feel pride for their caste and not ready to give up their caste and socioeconomic privileges derived from their caste. So he studied various religions and found flaws and vulnerabilities in almost every one of them. He like Buddhism because it preached non-violence, peace and equality. It was also a simple and logical religion. Ambedkar revived old Buddhism in a new form called 'navayana' or 'neo-buddhism' which was distinct from other varieties of East Asian Buddhism which was riddled with idol worship and blind faith."},{"prompt":"w can I learn a dance? I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","completion":"There are several ways to get started with dancing, and the approach you take will depend on your personal preferences and goals. Here are a few suggestions: 1. Determine your dance style: There are many different styles of dance, such as ballet, hip-hop, salsa, ballroom, and more. Think about the types of music you enjoy and the style of movement that appeals to you. 2. Find a class or instructor: Once you know what style of dance you're interested in, search for classes or instructors in your area. Many dance studios offer introductory classes for beginners. 3. Practice at home: If you're not ready to take a class yet, try practicing at home. You can find instructional videos online, or simply put on some music and move your body. 4. Attend dance events: Going to dance events, such as parties, concerts, or performances, can help you get a sense of the style and culture of the dance you're interested in. 5. Be patient and persistent: Learning to dance takes time and practice, so don't get discouraged if you don't get it right away. Stick with it and keep practicing, and you'll see improvement over time.

What will be expectations related to rupee in 2023?","completion":"The ruppee weakened sharply to a new low against US dollar on 5th July , 2022. Ruppee weakened to 79.3 per dollar. The value of Indian ruppee compared to US dollar works on a demand and supply basis.When there is high demand for US dollar , the value of the ruppee decrease and vice versa. The Indian currency has been on the decline since early this year beacuse of - Supply chains being hit by the Russia - Ukraine war.High crude oil prices.InflationGlobal economic challenges exacerbated by the covid pandemic.Foreign capital outflow. As money flows out of India, the ruppee dollar exchange rate gets impacted , leads to deprcaiate the Ruppee. → a falling ruppee put pressure on the already high import prices of crude and raw materials, resulting in higher imported inflation. Photo source : Live mint. The biggest impact of weakening ruppee is inflation, given Indian imports more than 80% of its crude oil. (When goods become more and more expensive it leads to rising inflation.) What is its impact on Household expenses? Due to increase in increase in prices of fuel(because india depend on crude oil imports) such as diesel, petrol and cooking gas etc, leads to rise in transport costs. There will be an indirect impact on the daily household items you consume. Their costs will go up because production and transportation costs linked to oil will increase. Electronics are also set to be expensive. Devices like mobile phones, laptops, TV and solar plates, among other household electrical goods, will cost you more. RUPPEE IN FY2023? Some analysts see the ruppee sliding to 82 against US dollar by December and are also expecting that the Indian rupee to hit 78.19 per US dollar in FY23.

Four year culinary school BS culinary degree. you will be recognized as a Chef by most organizations. Cons Culinary School AS degree. You will not learn the pace of an actual kitchen. You will not have to learn how to get your self out of the weeds.

Lying to your partner about something significant can be a major betrayal of trust. Withholding important information or hiding something significant from your partner can also be a betrayal of trust. Having an emotional affair with someone outside of your relationship even if there is no physical intimacy or infidelity can be a huge betrayal of trust. This is one of the hardest to discover and usually a prelude to actual cheating or infidelity. This is usually the best time to nip it in the bud or do something about the state of things in the relationship. Forms of physical abuse which include but not limited to hitting, pushing, neglecting your partner’s needs and not showing them the care and affection they deserve can also be a betrayal in a relationship and can deeply erode the foundation of a relationship."},{"prompt":"What are good master courses for data science in india?","completion":"India has a thriving tech industry and is becoming a hub for data science and AI courses.

Could that be why Thanos broke it so easily?","completion":"Caution: READ CAREFULLY… No this won't be true because if you remember before breaking that vibranium shield, Thanos had to suffer some seriously unexpectedly strong blows from it. Remember that incredible combo moves which cap used while welding mjolnir for the first time. How did he master the use of mjolnir, is a different story. But it was for sure that Thanos was flabbergasted with the blows from Cap and thus got enraged to a very great extent. Being enraged to this extent he had lost his focus and Cap was just showing him that he is the one of the greatest combatants alive. But the reason why the shield was broken is something interesting. I personally believe that the shield wasn't broken it was teared or sliced in a way. Cause that's the only way vibranium would break (in a sense). Many of the people may know that Thanos' sword was some heavenly metal (possibly Uru) which was razor sharp ( Even sharper than it). Vibranium on the other side can absorb and has absorbed huge amount of vibrations. It was broken because Thanos was furious about getting some seriously big blows from a puny human (basically wrong assumption). Thanos who usually punches very hard, just imagine he is furious now and is gonna deal with a human (sorry😅) almost half his size. Thank god and thank his shield that he avoided some serious injuries. So your theory that Tony has given some other shield or metal shield to Cap is false and it has to be.

Ignoring issues of legality (which vary by location), you should use whichever one you like better. There are a lot of solid arguments for using weed instead of alcohol. As a cop, I don’t think I’ve ever been attacked by someone who was high on weed. I wouldn’t even care to count the number of people who have attacked me while I was drunk. And I know that weed isn’t specifically good for you, but my layman’s understanding is that it doesn’t wreak quite the havoc on your body that alcohol can. And it’s far less addictive. But I like alcohol better. Granted, I haven’t smoked weed in over two decades, so if I were to try it again maybe I’d have a different opinion. But I don’t really like being high… one hit, and I was useless for a couple of hours. I can drink more or less depending on how drunk I’d like to get, but I never had that same ability with weed. And alcohol tastes better, and pairs better with most foods (although weed does make the sensory experience of food into something else…). Anyway, you can evaluate pros and cons if you want. But in absolute terms, the “best” choice is probably to do neither. Since we’re abandoning that course, pick your favorite.

As of January 2019, nobody could convince me that touchscreens on a conventional laptop are of any use. Even the touch bar on my MacBook Pro is something that I use maybe once a week or so and only to change the volume level of the speakers (which could be perfectly done via physical buttons). There’s also a reason why the OS for touchscreen devices is built differently than a normal computer OS, fingers are not very accurate when touching a screen due to their thickness compared to the size of a mouse cursor. Applications with crowded menus are impossible to use because more often than not, you would miss the actual spot you intended to put your finger on, and trigger the wrong command. Therefore the larger buttons on tablets and smartphones, they were never intended for precision work. As others including Jobs have mentioned, an almost vertical touchscreen is an ergonomic nightmare, typing is impossible and other gestures can be done on the touchpad using perfectly normal hand positioning. On those devices where you can flip the screen around and make it tablet-like, maybe but so far no manufacturer has managed to do it right, not to mention that you end up with a much too heavy tablet for practical purposes. Also, making laptops with touchscreens would cannibalize iPad sales, no bueno!"},{"prompt":"What type of binoculars and magnification would be good for looking at satellites and the ISS?","completion":"The first thing to try out is to look on the internet to see when satellites show up in the sky around your house. Then go outside with just your naked eyes and look for them. It’s not hard to see them if you look int the right area at the correct time. This is the most important thing. Most satellites look like jet airliners at 30,000 feet except there are no flashing lights, just a continuous light like a slow to medium fast “moving star”. It’s fun to track them with a pair of binoculars but the main thing is you have to be able to track it. For that practice, you can do it by tracking jet airliners flying over your house at night. Most satellites don’t show much detail but I have seen the space shuttle departing the ISS one time and it was really cool to see the two dots separated by a little space while moving across the sky. The visible times of theses sightings are often just a minute or less so it’s important to know when to look."},{"prompt":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","completion":"Public holiday"},{"prompt":"Why do pitchers get new balls when the balls hit the ground, but when a ball is hit, it is thrown back to the pitcher and put back in play?","completion":"First of all, it is NOT because Ray Chapman was killed by a pitched ball in 1920, as at least one other answerer has already pointed out. As recently as when I was a kid (50 years ago), each game ball was used until it got hit out of play (foul ball or home run), or until a pitcher requested a new one — in which case the ump put the old one in his handy ball pouch, then put it back in play the next time a “new” ball was needed. At the end of each half-inning, the last defensive player to touch the ball (usually the catcher if the third out was a strikeout, the first baseman if it was an infield ground-out, or an outfielder if a fly-out) would toss it back to the mound, where the opposing pitcher would pick it up and continue pitching with it, until a hitter batted it out of play. I don’t know precisely when that changed, but I know why — and it had a lot to do with pitchers scuffing and scratching and moistening and greasing and otherwise altering balls to make them move in unhittable ways. Pitchers used to conceal sandpaper and nail files and vaseline and other illegal tools and substances in their gloves or uniforms, precisely for that purpose. (A retired major league pitcher once told me that every spring, when he received a new Wilson glove, he replaced the red cloth behind the “W” logo with a piece of red sandpaper, and lots of other pitchers did too.) Replacing balls whenever they hit the ground, or are fouled back, or otherwise acquire any sort of scuffing accomplishes two things: (1) it eliminates any advantage to the pitcher that the scuffing might provide, and (2) it eliminates most pitcher cheating, since intentionally scuffing a ball that will only be in use for a few pitches isn’t worth the effort — or the risk. Not only are pitched balls replaced whenever they touch ground or a bat, but as the half-inning ends, the ball is carried to the dugout or tossed into the crowd by whoever has it (again, usually the catcher, first baseman, or an outfielder), rather than being thrown back to the mound, even if it hasn’t been scuffed, and the opposing pitcher gets a new ball. These days, the average life span of a major league baseball in game conditions is something like 3 pitches. As to why balls are not taken out of play after they are hit — usually they are. If you watch closely, you’ll see that the pitcher nearly always gets a new ball in those situations."},{"prompt":"anyone looking for a freight forwarder?","completion":"They negotiate discounted rates on big amounts of space with maritime carriers.

However, there are a few factors to consider when using a microwave oven: nutrient loss, uneven heating, packaging concerns, and hot spots and burns. To minimize nutrient loss, it's best to use minimal amounts of water and cook for shorter periods. To ensure food is heated uniformly, it's important to stir or rotate it during the cooking process. To avoid hot spots and burns, it's important to stir and test the temperature of heated food or liquids before consuming. When using a microwave oven, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions, use microwave-safe containers, and practice safe food handling to minimize any potential health risks. Microwave ovens can have a positive impact on health, but it is important to use the right cookware and plastic containers and wraps. It is also important to read the labels of frozen or pre-packaged meals and choose options with healthier ingredients and lower levels of sodium. Additionally, it is important to balance microwave cooking with other cooking methods to maintain a varied and nutritious diet. Additionally, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian if you have specific sensitivities or allergies to certain foods. Overall, using microwave ovens responsibly and in accordance with safety guidelines can provide a safe and convenient method of cooking or reheating food. Advantage: Microwave ovens offer several advantages, such as time-saving, energy-efficient, retention of nutrients, convenience and versatility, easy to use and clean, safety features, and uniform heating. Time-saving: Microwave ovens are designed to cook or heat food quickly, reducing cooking time compared to conventional methods. Energy-efficient: Microwave ovens are generally more energy-efficient than traditional cooking methods. Retention of nutrients: Microwave cooking can help retain heat-sensitive nutrients such as vitamin C and other water-soluble vitamins. Convenience and versatility: Microwave ovens are suitable for a wide range of cooking tasks, such as reheating leftovers, defrosting frozen food, cooking vegetables, making popcorn, and more. Easy to use and clean: Microwave ovens are user-friendly with simple controls and settings. Safety features: Modern microwave ovens are equipped with safety features such as child locks, timers, and automatic shut-off functions. Uniform heating: Microwave ovens can provide relatively uniform heating throughout the food, resulting in evenly cooked dishes. It is important to note that while microwave ovens offer several advantages, they should be used responsibly and in accordance Cons: Microwave ovens have several disadvantages, such as uneven heating, potential nutrient loss, limited browning and texture, and packaging concerns. Uneven heating can lead to burns if not properly accounted for. Nutrient loss can be minimized by using minimal amounts of water and cooking for shorter periods. Limited browning and texture can be achieved through additional cooking methods. Packaging concerns can be addressed by using microwave-safe containers and avoid using plastic wrap that is not labeled as microwave-safe. Microwave ovens are generally safe when used properly, but there are some safety precautions to consider. For example, certain types of containers or materials not designated as microwave-safe can lead to melting, releasing harmful chemicals, or even causing fires. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions and use caution when operating the microwave oven. By being aware of these potential drawbacks and using microwave ovens responsibly, people can mitigate risks and make the most of their convenience in the kitchen."},{"prompt":"w can we ensure that pulp industries pay a fair price to mango farmers?","completion":"Ensuring that pulp industries pay a fair price to mango farmers involves addressing various factors and implementing effective mechanisms. Here are some considerations: 1. Transparent pricing mechanisms: Implement transparent pricing mechanisms that ensure fairness in determining the price of mangoes. This can include establishing market-based pricing systems, creating platforms for price discovery, and promoting open and competitive bidding processes. 2. Contract farming and written agreements: Encourage the use of written contracts between mango farmers and pulp industries. These contracts should clearly define the terms and conditions, including the quantity, quality requirements, pricing, payment terms, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Contract farming provides a structured framework that helps protect farmers' interests and ensures fair dealings. 3. Farmer organizations and cooperatives: Strengthen farmer organizations and cooperatives to collectively negotiate prices with pulp industries. Farmer collectives can enhance the bargaining power of mango farmers and enable them to secure better prices through collective marketing and negotiations. 4. Market information and capacity building: Provide mango farmers with access to market information, including price trends, demand forecasts, and processing industry requirements. This information empowers farmers to make informed decisions and negotiate fair prices. Capacity-building programs can also enhance farmers' understanding of market dynamics and improve their negotiation skills. 5. Government regulations and interventions: Governments can play a crucial role in ensuring fair pricing for mango farmers by enacting policies and regulations that protect their interests. This can include setting minimum support prices, regulating pulp industries to prevent unfair practices, and providing subsidies or incentives to support mango cultivation. 6. Quality standards and certification: Encourage mango farmers to adopt good agricultural practices and obtain quality certifications. Implementing quality standards helps ensure that farmers receive fair prices for their high-quality produce. Certifications such as organic or fair trade can provide additional value and differentiation, attracting buyers willing to pay premium prices. 7. Collaboration and dialogue: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between mango farmers, pulp industries, and relevant stakeholders. Engaging in open discussions and partnerships can help foster mutually beneficial relationships, address concerns, and find solutions that promote fair pricing practices.

Indeed, the harm brought about by the air ship affecting the towers — even at the high rate of speed they were voyaging — was not lethal to either tower. These structures were broadly planned and built to flex in solid powerful breezes or quakes, and even retain the effect of the biggest business air ship at the time which was a Boeing 707 four-motor traveler stream. You can't generally tell from accessible video or film, yet the underlying effect made the upper segment of the structures uproot 10– 20 feet from the focal point of gravity, and after that influenced back like a pendulum. Individuals who were up there and endure said it felt like they would overturn. So far the structures performed flawlessly, demonstration of the soundness of the designing and the redundancies in redistributing pressure loads. Things being what they are, the end result for cause complete disappointment? The flames is what occurred. Ok, please! Fly fuel doesn't consume sufficiently hot to soften steel. What's more, how could a bundle of paper and office furniture consume at such high temperatures? One needs to comprehend that heat makes steel grow and twist, and lose auxiliary quality. Think about a Japanese sword producer. He's warming that exceptionally hard steel over a basic carbon fire. The steel hasn't liquefied, however it has turned out to be mollified and moldable to the degree he can overlay it and sledge it, again and again. Typically, if a flame begins in an electrical storeroom, it will consume everything in that quick zone and afterward advancement to different regions. Overhead sprinkler frameworks and firemen will generally get things leveled out before it escapes hand. Be that as it may, on 9/11, those planes were filled for a cross-mainland flight. So right now of effect there was a deflagration of 10,000 gallons of fly fuel which touched off huge flames on 2 or 3 stories at the same time. This is path past the pale as far as reasonability by firemen even under the best of conditions. Be that as it may, for this situation we have the water channels which nourished the sprinkler framework disjoined. We have a lift framework rendered inoperable. What's more, we have a large number of individuals who should be cleared. This was grave. Alright, this is far up in the upper bits of the structure. How could those flames have influenced lower floors? What made them come up short? This is so. The flames had for all intents and purposes no effect on the lower 50 stories. The steel that was influenced by flame was the brackets and sections in the effect zone. For Truthers who question the seriousness of the flames, if it's not too much trouble clarify why such a significant number of individuals bounced to their demises from the region over the flames. Police helicopter film demonstrates the border sections on the floors of the effect zone bowing outward in the minutes prior to the breakdown. The steel that was holding up every one of the floors over this zone was preparing to clasp. Furthermore, clasp it did. This brought about a 25-story building falling 12 feet. That is a dynamic burden the floor beneath can't confront. Presently you have a 26-story building falling onto the following floor down, etc. Consider it tower of cards; you obliterate the whole segment of the 51st floor; the areas over them fall and include more weight harming the full structure and another floor goes down. It's a chain response; the main floors are the ones that take more time to disintegrate however it quickens as it gets more weight and energy from the fall. A fast aside: there is a vital contrast in building and material science between a \\"static\\" load and a \\"dynamic\\" load. For instance, when vehicles used to have hearty guards, Car A could get behind Car B and drive it forward and even push it onto the expressway and slowly accelerate to 90 mph. Generally, neither one of the cars will continue critical harm to their guards. This is a static burden. There is noteworthy power connected yet in a smooth manner. In a marginally unique situation Car B is stationary and Car An is going at 90 mph. Vehicle A chooses he's going to push Car B again at 90 mph. Be that as it may, this time the minute Car A reaches Car B there is a horrendous sound of crushing metal and the gas tank breaks and bursts into flames. This is a dynamic burden. Despite the fact that Car A can drive Car B up to 90mph, the second situation includes unexpected increasing speed. So with the WTC towers when everything is attached together legitimately, the lower floors bolster the heaviness of the upper floors. Be that as it may, when those upper floors experience a speeding up, presently you're taking a gander at a power the structure was not intended to deal with."},{"prompt":"w is the postgraduate hostel at AIIMS Bhubaneswar?","completion":"The Postgraduate Hostels in AIIMS Bhubaneswar are Co-Ed except the PG Block for Msc & 4th Year Nursing.

That said, I'm sure there are millions of ethnic Jews who aren't religious. There are also some Jews who are religious but practice a religion other than Judaism. They'd still be ethically Jewish.

Are Macedonians Greek (not North Macedonia)?","completion":"The makeup of the current world is radically different then in the ancient times. Quote from a relevant article states that “The Mackednoi (Mahk-ed-noy) tribe first inhabited the area and gave the country its name. According to the ancient historian, Herodotus, they were the first people to call themselves “hellenes.” The term Hellenistic later became synonymous with all things Greek. However, the Mackednoi tribe had little to do with southern Greece for centuries.” Britannica’s description is right on the money in my mind becasue the hard fact that can be seen on the ground today (I live in Northern Greece) is that it is a mix salad of people but in Greece the people rightly look as Greek Macedonia being Greek and those Greek People are as Greek as any Greek person.

Why we are use for construction?","completion":"Cement is a fine mineral powder manufactured with very precise processes. Mixed with water, this powder transforms into a paste that binds and hardens when submerged in water. Because the composition and fineness of the powder may vary, cement has different properties depending upon its makeup. Cement is the main component of concrete. It's an economical, high-quality construction material used in construction projects worldwide. Cement is made by grinding together a mixture of limestone and clay, which is then heated at a temperature of 1,450°C. What results is a granular substance called \\"clinker,\\" a combination of calcium, silicate, alumina and iron oxide. Some of the reasons for its popularity in construction site. 01. Cement can be produced in large volumes in controlled condition, packed and transported. 02. Cement is a several times stronger binding material than lime and clay. 03. It can be mixed and used at will with locally available materials at site. 04. When stored properly in ordinary atmosphere it does not deteriorate for reasonably longer time (at least 3 to 4 month). 05. When mixed with water, starts setting and gain sufficient strength in a day or two, where as other binding materials require much longer time. Hence increase speed of construction. 06. It can withstand compressive stresses well. Where tension and shear stresses occurs it gives good bond to steel reinforcement and transfers excess stresses to steel. 07. It is produced from the materials like limestone, hematite, bauxite, clay, etc which are plentifully available in the upper crust of the earth. 08. It imparts strength and durability to building elements. Not only that with cement, the speed of construction also gets faster. 09. It is comparatively cheaper material.

Melisandre refers to stone dragon (or dragons) and believes she can wake one (or more) with rituals involving king’s blood. It’s also been prophesied that Azor Ahai will “wake dragons out of stone.” Melisandre believes in that prophecy, so that’s probably how she got the idea. In her words: I have seen it in the flames, read of it in ancient prophecy. When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. And: The Lord of Light cherishes the innocent. There is no sacrifice more precious. From his king’s blood and his untainted fire, a dragon shall be born. Apart from Melisandre, Shireen, Stannis’ daughter has also had dreams about stone dragons. She tells a maester: I had bad dreams. About the [stone] dragons. They were coming to eat me. There are basically three schools of thought about the stone dragons among fans. They are the dragon statues of Dragonstone. Those are the dragons Shireen refers to. To be honest, that doesn’t look like a very reasonable theory to me. Why would a statue come to life? It’s quite unprecedented and makes little sense.They are Daenerys’ dragons or other dragons born of petrified dragon eggs. It’s an obvious reference, but a valid one nonetheless. By the way, this is one of the basic arguments for those who think Daenerys is Azor Ahai reborn.Stone dragon(s) is a metaphor for a Targaryen living in obscurity, most probably Jon Snow. In dreams and visions, people are represented by animals and other symbols associated with their houses—Tullys are fish, Stark are wolves and Targaryens are dragons. If that’s the case, then Jon Snow is most probably Azor Ahai, and perhaps Shireen will get sacrificed to bring him back to life."},{"prompt":"w do I get the birth certificate for my child?","completion":"PROCEDURE OF DELAYED BIRTH REGISTRATION STEP 1- Apply for non-availability certificate of birth where to contact - office of birth and death registrar Documents needed - DOB proof STEP 2- Apply for delayed birth registration order (from DM/SDM or any other first-class magistrate) Where to contact- office of DM/SDM or court Documents needed- 1-BIRTH REPORT, 2-NON AVAILABILITY CERTIFICATE, 3-AFFIDAVIT/SELF DECLARATION OF PARENTS, 4-AFFIDAVIT OF WITNESSES, 5-DOB PROOF, 6-ID/ADDRESS PROOF STEP 3- Apply for birth registration Where to contact - office of birth and death registrar documents needed - 1-DELAYED BIRTH REGISTRATION ORDER, 2-DOB PROOF, 3- ID/ADDRESS PROOF, 4-BIRTH REPORT STEP 4- After successful registration collect the birth certificate from the office of birth and death registrar or download from [LINKED_TEXT: Civil Registration System] [URL: http://www.crsorgi.gov.in/] [non-availability certificate→ delayed birth registration order → birth registration →birth certificate] For fee and other information see [LINKED_TEXT: RBD RULES] [URL: http://crsorgi.gov.in/web/uploads/download/Births_and_Deaths_Rules_1999.pdf]"},{"prompt":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","completion":"No!

This is largely because humans inherently have varying preferences and opinions, and there are numerous factors to consider when deciding on a vacation spot. For example, availability of direct flight routes from Canada can be a major consideration, as well as pricing, weather conditions, and cultural activities. There could also be a number of subjective factors, such as family history or a particular interest in a certain culture, that might lead to preferring a cold climate or a warm climate.

Wouldn't a higher C turret allow all guns to fire forwards?","completion":"A ship with three sequential superfiring turrets is indeed possible and was implemented on the British Dido-class and US Atlanta-class cruisers. Dido-class Atlanta-class The disadvantage of this arrangement is a higher centre of mass which decreases stability, especially in heavy seas. The Didos and Atlantas carried a 5.25” and 5” main armament respectively. These relatively light guns and light turret armour reduced the weight penalty of the superfiring turrets to within acceptable limits. The Nelson-class carried 16” guns (108 tons each as opposed to around 4.5 tons for the 5.25”) and the turrets and mounts were proportionately more heavily armoured. Three superfiring turrets were totally impractical. The Nelson-class were designed with three turrets forwards in an attempt to minimise the space (and weight) required by the armoured citadel in order to meet the constraints of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Nelson-class The result was the curious staggered arrangement seen above. Although this limited the Nelson-class to firing only six guns directly forward, it should be borne in mind firstly, that most previous battleships could only fire four guns directly forward and secondly, that at the time of the design it was still anticipated that battleships would fight in line of battle and thus be firing broadside rather than straight ahead. In light of these factors, the design compromise made for this class was not really a significant disadvantage."},{"prompt":"What are the best restaurants to try when visiting Bengaluru, Karnataka, India?

None of my friends would ride with me. It took a long time and a lot of patience, but I was able to get most of his misbehavior under control. He and I often walked in the redwoods on a favorite trail. But I sprained my ankle and Henry hadn’t been walked for a month. I was looking forward to getting back out there one afternoon but I had a lot of errands so we didn’t arrive at the trailhead until close to 5pm. It didn’t matter. Police tape had closed the trail. A woman runner had been badly beaten and raped. Unnerved, I called Henry’s trainer to ask whether Henry could be trained to protect me. The trainer said teaching a seventy pound biting poodle to bite wasn’t a good idea. He had a four month old German Shepherd puppy, descended from a line of Schutzhund champions. Her litter mates had been sold two months before but Jessie, as she was named, was an alpha and he wasn’t selling her to anyone who wouldn’t keep her under control. Because of my work with Henry, he believed I would be a good owner for her. I went to see her, expecting the image of a noble German Shepherd. The dog who bounded down their steps toward me was a mop of long fur and clumsy puppyness. Matt, the trainer, suggested I take her to the beach and get to know her. I plopped her in the backseat of my car and drove to the beach. There I found a stick and we played fetch for several minutes. The beach was deserted but suddenly Jessie dropped her stick and ran to me, sitting down beside me, her focus on a man coming toward us. She didn’t move, growl, bark or in any way threaten him, but she sat close to me with her eyes pinned on this stranger. He came up and spoke to me about the puppy, noting she seemed like an excellent dog. Then he went on his way. As soon as he did, Jessie ran back to her stick and we resumed the game. I reached down and kissed the top of her head. “You’re my dog now,” I said. A year later, we were doing protection training (not because she needed to learn to protect me but because she needed to be trained to stop protecting me when I said to), and a woman volunteered to play the “bad guy.” She yelled at me, waved her arms and acted like she hated me. I told Jessie to “attack”. She just looked at me, and I could see what she was thinking. Jessie was brilliant. “It’s only a woman,” she would’ve said if she’d been able to speak. The trainer handed the woman a styrofoam bat and she proceeded toward me with it raised. At that point, Jessie attacked. She was the most beautiful German Shepherd I’ve ever seen and her alpha posture was something to behold. She never attacked another dog, completely ignored little yapping guys that imagined they could take on an 85-pound Shepherd, and was loving with anybody she trusted, and she trusted most people. On the trail, more than once we came around a bend to find a dog flattened on the ground, its owner yelling, “Get up! What’s wrong with you?” As soon as we passed, the dog would jump up and run on. Toward the end of her life, Jessie’s back legs gave out and she was in a wheelchair. However, just before that, she’d been confined to the downstairs, of course, because she couldn’t mount the steps. But a workman came to discuss some work in the upstairs with me. As we talked, I suddenly heard her trying to get upstairs. I ran to stop her, but too late, she’d made it most of the way but then slid all the way to the bottom. Clearly, she didn’t want me unprotected with a strange man. She died st thirteen, a victim of horrible hip dysplasia and degenerative myelopathy of the spine. I lost her nine years ago but to this day I weep over her. I have wonderful dogs now, two German shepherds and a Havanese, but I’ll never see the likes of Jessie again. She was the exemplar of the breed: intense, courageous, intelligent, and loyal. I have no doubt she would’ve risked her life to save mine. Because of Jessie, as long as I live, I’ll always own a shepherd."},{"prompt":"Which New Testament verses clearly support the conservative Christian political position insisting capitalism as the only acceptable political economy in the United States?","completion":"None whatsoever.

Their villians are not dark reflections of themselves (as, for example, Batman and Joker). Their villains represent competing ideologies. The X-Men are an entirely ideological organization. It is made up of people who believe in Xavier's dream: that peaceful coexistence is both possible and makes us stronger. They are basically hippies running a commune. All these people? Well they all have different ideologies. Competing ideologies. And the X-Men's fights are just visual metaphors for debate. Apocalypse believes in social darwinism. Mr. Sinister believes in eugenics. Mojo believes in violence as entertainment. The Hellfire Club believes in unfettered capitalism. The Sentinels represent fascism. The Brotherhood of Mutants represent various terrorist ideologies. And Magneto, well Magneto represents separatism and supremacy in relation to the X-Men's belief in integration and egalitarianism. From Magneto's point of view, the Nazis will always come. Always. And “never again” means being strong enough to make sure that it never happens again. And in one of the most controversial elements of the X-Men, they make it clear that Magneto is right. We have seen enough death and destruction wrought by the Sentinels to know Magneto's beliefs are pretty grounded in a realistic worldview. The X-Men are operating entirely on faith. On the faith that humanity has a better nature. That every stumble will result in a rise. So why isn't Magneto strictly a villain? While Magneto has some degree of ego, and has done some some terrible things… what he does isn't for selfish reasons. It isn't doing it for greed. He isn't Doctor Doom trying to take over the world just because he has a massive ego. He doesn't care about vengeance. He is not a psychopath. Magneto has a specific view on human nature, and everything he does is based on an entirely logical course of action given that belief. Magneto genuinely wants to save his people. Magneto saw his people die, his family die, once and is determined to prevent that from happening again. And given that we have seen Sentinels kill 16 million mutants in the span of minutes, his concerns and approach are quite valid. As with all the X-Men villains, all it takes to turn them into heroes is a conversation. Simply persuading them that Xavier's way is better. This is about ideology. And it is why the X-Men are so astoundingly successful at rehabilitation. When the X-Men make a case that their point of view is better than his, Magneto becomes a hero. When he becomes disillusioned with their idealism and blind faith he goes back to being a villain. It is pretty simple."},{"prompt":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","completion":"There are several ways to make money online without an initial investment in 2023: Freelancing: Offer your skills on platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, or Fiverr.Content Creation: Start a blog, YouTube channel, or podcast and monetize through ads, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing.Online Surveys and Microtasks: Participate in online surveys or complete small tasks on platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk.Online Tutoring or Teaching: Share your expertise through online tutoring or teaching platforms like VIPKid or Teachable.Virtual Assistance: Provide administrative support, social media management, or customer service remotely.Remote Work: Search for remote job opportunities on websites like [LINKED_TEXT: http://Remote.co] [URL: http://remote.co/] or We Work Remotely.Selling Crafts or Products: Sell handmade crafts or products on platforms like Etsy or eBay.Writing and Publishing: Write and self-publish eBooks or articles on platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing or Medium.Stock Photography: Sell your photos on stock photography websites like Shutterstock or Adobe Stock.Online Gigs: Offer services like graphic design, digital marketing, or writing on platforms like Fiverr or TaskRabbit.

We were going to see escape room, but we had to settle for the dog movie, which was ok with us, because Escape Room was sold out. When we entered the movie, there was a lot of empty seats. Keep in mind that this is a movie theatre where you pick your seats in advance. We went to our seats and a group of teenagers were in them. Me (20) my boyfriend (24) and my best friend (18) decided that it didn’t really matter where we sat, so we sat in front of them. This was a HUGE MISTAKE! They spent the entire movie talking, laughing (this movie was sad!!!) , screaming and playing on their phones; they even proceeded to drop their phones several times. By the end of the movie my group and I were so annoyed as we weren’t able to enjoy it since these young adults were so inconsiderate!

Circumstances are not favorable to undertake such a task in this generation. But if you wish to do so, you can opt forests which are in and around Thiruvannamalai. It is located at the foot of Arunachal Hill. It is a place where many siddhars, sadhus live. There are many stories of miracles performed by Siddars at this place. Pic : Thiruvannamalai temple If you want to undertake this journey to attain moksha, I think it's not necessary because Lord Krishna says : Per Srimad Bhagavatham - kaler dosha-nidhe rajann asti hy eko maha gunah kirtanad eva krishnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet “Although Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: simply by chanting the names of Krishna, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.” It is not in reciting Sri Krishna’s name over and over without really feeling it that one would attain Moksha, but he meant – When an individual truly realises his own self, when there is no place for Ego and no narrow limited, thoughts, it is only then a human truly becomes one with Krishna. One who is one with Sri Krishna is one with the source and hence Enlightened. In kaliyuga, chanting the name of God with true devotion can liberate us from sins and helps us to attain moksha.

It all came together for Yoda when he was watching over Padme as she was giving birth to Luke and Leia. Yoda always sensed there was something troubling Anakin, that no other Jedi including Obi Wan could sense. It all made sense to him in the end. Palpatine manipulated young Skywalker’s feelings and forced him down the path of the Dark Side in order to save the one he truly loves. Also not just Yoda knew this, but Windu has reason to believe this as well too. As Anakin stepped in to try and stop Windu from killing Palpatine, Windus thoughts and distrust of Anakins confusion and arrogance all game together. Windu figured out that Palpatine manipulated the boy and twisted his mind into thinking the Jedi were evil, and that Sidious can “save the ones he loves”. And Mace could sense that in that moment, Anakin was being consumed by Darth Vader. And Windu didn’t want for that to happen to him, because he did not want to kill the boy. Due to Mace Windus shatter point technique, he needs to remain 100% focused on Palpatine to kill him and if he were to stop and talk to Anakin, Palpatine would have killed him. At this point he senses this as they repel lightning from each other and Mace Windu desperately cries out: For that’s all Mace Windu can say. Because if he were to say more he would lose his shatterpoint focus on Palpatine. Lots of people think Mace Windu hates Anakin and that couldn’t be further from the case here. He cared about the boy. Why would Windu cry out to Anakin “Don’t listen to him” if not to try and save him from the path he was going down. Windu already knew he won but wanted to save Anakin from making the wrong choice."},{"prompt":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","completion":"Here are some amazing and interesting facts about the Indian Railways: The Indian Railways is one of the largest rail networks in the world, with over 115,000 km of track and over 7,000 stations.The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, also known as the \\"Toy Train,\\" is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is the oldest operating railway in India.The Indian Railways employs over 1.5 million people, making it the largest employer in India and the eighth largest employer in the world.The Indian Railways also runs a special train service for elephants called the \\"Elephant Express,\\" which transports the animals to various wildlife reserves and national parks across India.The Indian Railways serves over 25 million passengers every day, which is equivalent to the entire population of Australia.In 2015, the Indian Railways introduced a special \\"luxury\\" train service called the Maharaja Express, which offers a 7-day trip through various tourist destinations in India, including the Taj Mahal and Jaipur.The Indian Railways has also set a Guinness World Record for the world's longest platform at the Gorakhpur railway station in Uttar Pradesh, which measures 1,366 meters in length.The Indian Railways is famous for its \\"chai-wallahs,\\" or tea vendors, who serve up hot tea and snacks to passengers on board the trains.The Indian Railways also has a mascot named Bholu, a cartoon elephant that was introduced in 2002 to promote railway safety.The Indian Railways is known for its \\"jugaad\\" mentality, which refers to the innovative and creative ways that people find to solve problems and get things done.

I smoked for 20+ years and smelled like an ashtray, had no motivation, was tired all of the time and I couldn’t breath. I tried quitting so many times and I tried everything. The patch, cold turkey, Wellbutrin, the gum, the fake cigs etc. I didn’t try Chantax but I watched a friend of mine lose her mind on that stuff so I was too afraid to try it. One day I saw someone with an ecig and I asked a million questions about it. Is it bad for you, (like cigs weren’t) does it really work, what milligram of nicotine should I start with, where do I get one, etc. I tried it and it didn’t work but this was back in 2009–2010. I tried it a few more times but it still didn’t work. I was using those ecigs that looked like reg cigs that came with the prefilled cartridges and those things back then, sucked. Then a friend introduced me to an ecig that had a tank on it. One of those little pen Vapes where you put your own e-liquid in them. I tried that and immediately went out and bought one. I set my quit date and was ready to go. It was New Years Day like every other year where I tried to quit and that usually only lasted anywhere from 4 to 24 hours. Well, on New Years Eve, I went to the store and bought my last pack of smokes and about 30 min later, I was being rushed to the hospital for an emergency surgery. When they told me they were going to admit me, I panicked. I hadn’t even smoked a cig out of that pack. And since I couldn’t smoke in the hospital, I tried to “go out to my car for something” and they reminded me that this was an emergency. So I sent my friend to my house to grab my ecig starter kit and (I don’t condone this, it’s just what happened) I vaped in the hospital. It was one of those really small vapes that didn’t put out the big cloud of vapor. On day three of my hospital stay, I was sitting there when it occurred to me; I hadn’t had a cig in three days and I hadn’t even noticed.

Here are some mistakes to avoid: Lack of clarity: Failing to clearly communicate the main message or insights in your visualization can confuse your audience. Make sure your visualization has a clear purpose and is designed in a way that effectively conveys the intended information.Overcomplicating the design: Complex and cluttered visualizations can overwhelm viewers and make it difficult to extract meaningful insights. Keep your design simple, decluttered, and focused on the most important elements of the data.Choosing inappropriate chart types: Selecting a chart or graph that doesn't align with your data or message can misrepresent the information. Make sure to choose the appropriate chart type that best represents the relationships and patterns in your data.Inaccurate or misleading representations: Misleading or distorted visual representations can lead to incorrect interpretations. Ensure that your axes, scales, and data points accurately reflect the underlying data and don't mislead your audience.Ignoring the audience's needs: Failing to consider the needs, preferences, and knowledge level of your audience can result in visualizations that are ineffective or confusing to interpret. Tailor your visualizations to match the audience's background and the insights they seek.Ineffective use of color: Misusing color can hinder understanding and create confusion. Use color purposefully to highlight key information, create visual distinctions, or represent specific categories. Avoid using excessive or clashing colors that distract from the data.Lack of context and annotations: Data visualizations should provide sufficient context and explanatory elements to guide interpretation. Include titles, captions, legends, and axis labels to provide context, definitions, and explanations.Poor data labeling: Inadequate labeling or missing data labels can make it difficult for viewers to understand the information being presented. Ensure that data points, categories, and values are clearly labeled to prevent ambiguity.Ignoring accessibility: Failing to consider accessibility features can exclude individuals with visual impairments or other disabilities from accessing and understanding your visualizations. Provide alternative text descriptions for images, use appropriate contrast, and ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.Lack of testing and feedback: Skipping the testing and feedback phase can lead to missed opportunities for improvement. Test your visualizations with sample users, gather feedback, and iterate on your design to enhance its effectiveness. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can create data visualizations that are clear, accurate, and impactful, enabling your audience to easily understand and gain insights from the presented data."},{"prompt":"My family wants to put my cat down. She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","completion":"No, a vet would not do that. A vet will take a look at a sick cat and offer treatment options. A cat owner that can’t (or won’t) take care of a cat should bring it to the SPCA or a nearby shelter that will find a new home for it with a family that will properly care for it. People are not assholes for their opinion that taking care of a pet is part of the explicit duty of a pet owner. This is not only a wide-held belief in areas where cats (and other animals) are kept as pets, but in many places this is also a matter of law. To fail to take care of the animal, or to kill it rather than seek proper veterinary attention is a crime in many jurisdictions."},{"prompt":"Where can I invest?","completion":"It’s been a rocky start to the year for Bitcoin, but experts still say it will hit 100,000 — and that it’s more a matter of when, not if.

The largest crypto has fought its way back from the weekend’s plunge to below 18,000, a new low since December 2020. Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA, says the latest crypto market crash was spurred by a de-risking Wall Street moment as many investors are feeling pessimistic about the economy amid surging inflation, a shaky stock market, and rising interest rates. The crypto market has increasingly tracked the stock market in recent months, which makes it even more intertwined with global economic factors. In addition to macreconomic factors, Moya says investors fear that problems at major crypto players could unleash a wider market shakeout.

Do they just deny the facts?","completion":"I can’t speak for “gun fanatics”. We are just a humble gun violence research organization (neither pro-gun not anti-gun, just pro-math and anti B.S.). My set of responses would be from an analytic and experience standpoint, and would be these: Show me the studies: The summary is insufficient to acknowledge.Summarize the two common critical research components of each: If you do not know what those two components are, then you cannot properly review the works.Are there two or more defects in either or both of those two components: If so, then the study is to be rejected. Chapter ten of our book [LINKED_TEXT: Guns and Control] [URL: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1510760075/] is a review of how to evaluate research on gun policy. We open the chapter with this quote from an academic who has been both a review judge and published many papers: “Peer review, on which lay people place great weight, varies from being an important control, where the editors and the referees are competent and responsible, to being a complete farce.” The point is that within research fields, there is a lot of junk. Just a couple of years ago, one wag got six completely bogus papers published in peer review journals. Our 25 years reviewing gun policy papers leads us to believe there is a tremendous amount of junk “science” in this field. So much so we have a page at the [LINKED_TEXT: Gun Facts] [URL: http://www.gunfacts.info/] website where we list studies that got media attention but which were defective. My favorite was a paper that claimed one form of gun control reduced homicides. The paper itself used synthetic modeling to create crime statistic out of thin air. In these United States, we have a fairly robust crime data collection system, so there is no need to invent numbers. But it gets worse. All models, including synthetic models, are based on one or more assumptions. The biggest assumption in this paper’s model was the conclusion of another paper. However, that paper had been withdrawn, which typically occurs when the author is confronted with errors that invalidate their conclusions (despite the paper previously having passed peer review). So a flawed study fed another flawed study. Much of the junk research on guns comes from the medical community. They publish not in criminology journals (where their inappropriate methods and horrific data sources would be critiqued) but in medical journals where their peers, who lack backgrounds in criminology and statistics, rubber stamp the conclusions. The Michael Bloomberg School of Public Health at John Hopkins is the most frequent offender, and as we all know, Bloomberg is the bank for gun control advocacy groups. In short, the proof (or lack of proof) is not in accepting some headline about 130 studies. The proof is in reading as many of those studies as you can, from a statistical criminology perspective, and then seeing how many pass this critical test."},{"prompt":"w do we plan to build a Moon base while we can't successfully recreate a moon base on Earth (e.g. Biosphere 2)?","completion":"Apples and oranges.

Space.com says that :- One possible solution, which theorists borrowed from nuclear physicists in the 1970s, is to get rid of the problematic, point-like graviton particles. Strings, and only strings, can collide and rebound cleanly without implying physically impossible infinities. \\"A one-dimensional object — that's the thing that really tames the infinities that come up in the calculations,\\" said Marika Taylor, a theoretical physicist at the University of Southampton in England. String theory turns the page on the standard description of the universe by replacing all matter and force particles with just one element: Tiny vibrating strings that twist and turn in complicated ways that, from our perspective, look like particles. But string theory has lately come under greater scrutiny.

However, it's important to note that diabetes is a complex condition, and it is always recommended to consult with a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner or healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some of the commonly used Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes: 1. Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia): Bitter melon is known for its blood sugar-lowering properties. It contains compounds that help improve insulin secretion and utilization, thus aiding in diabetes management. Bitter melon can be consumed as a vegetable, juice, or in supplement form. 2. Gurmar (Gymnema sylvestre): Gurmar, also known as the \\"sugar destroyer,\\" is an herb that has been used in Ayurveda to support healthy blood sugar levels. It helps reduce sugar cravings and may support insulin production. Gurmar is commonly consumed as a tea or in supplement form. 3. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum): Cinnamon has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and regulate blood sugar levels. Including cinnamon in your diet or taking it as a supplement can be beneficial for diabetes management. 4. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek seeds are rich in soluble fiber and have been found to help lower blood sugar levels. They can be consumed as a spice in cooking or soaked in water overnight and consumed on an empty stomach. 5. Indian Gooseberry (Emblica officinalis): Indian gooseberry, also known as Amla, is a rich source of vitamin C and antioxidants. It may help improve glucose metabolism, support pancreatic function, and enhance insulin sensitivity. It's important to remember that Ayurvedic medicine is holistic and focuses on an individual's overall well-being. Lifestyle modifications, diet, and exercise also play a crucial role in managing diabetes. Therefore, it is advisable to seek guidance from a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner who can provide a personalized treatment plan based on your specific needs, medical history, and dosha imbalance.

Funny that I almost never hear a bit of concern about that from the ‘pro-lifers.’ Per the NIH, about 1/3 to ½ of fetal and maternal deaths are preventable through prenatal care. What is the current ‘administration’ and the Catholic Church working against – access to health care for women. The percentage of abortions performed because of medical reasons is about 20%. Doctor’s are not God. They cannot save everyone. Sometimes they have to choose which one they can save. The South American OB/GYN’s recently petitioned the Church to relax its antiabortion stance as they were sick of seeing the resultant carnage. “Cause of Fetal Death; Data from the Fetal Death Report, 2014”, National Vital Statistics Volume 65 Number 7 published October 31, 2016 by the CDC. Bureaus of Justice Statistics USDOJ. “Family Violence Statistics”, Cervical Cancer Vaccine I have been researching the demographics on abortion – some ‘fun’ facts –Most women who have abortions are older women stressed to the max caring for family members and literally having to decide who lives and who dies. The number of abortions is at a record low since Roe vs. Wade. The number of abortions in this country is 1 per 70 Catholics. Out of 70 Catholics no one is willing to help one desperate woman? The lady on the Women’s Rally bus agreed. She had a friend considering an abortion because she was overwhelmed. She went to all the churches in town and could find only two people who were willing to help her.

If we complain, they will restrict access to health care and REALLY jack up the death rate and that’ll learn us to get uppity.

To take one easy example from Berkshire’s 2018 10K (annual report): Derivative contracts may require significant cash settlement payments and result in significant losses in the future. Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts. The contracts remaining at year end 2018 will expire from 2019 through 2025. Risks of losses under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major US and international stock indexes. We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in settlement payments that significantly exceed the year end 2018 intrinsic value of the contracts (1.7 billion), recorded fair value (2.45 billion) or the premiums we received at inception (4.0 billion.)

He would call me for hours talking to me about how he feels for his crush, and what should be his next steps to woo her. Most of the time, I would just listen and sometimes would give some random unsolicited advice which was ignored. The calls always ended leaving me drained, and exhausted. I killed too much of my valuable time entertaining him. That would leave me with less time for myself and MY people. Eventually, they got married, and he became a contact limited to Facebook. I now see that I acted as only a ‘soundboard’. In the last one or two years, I have redefined friendship. What do I expect? What can I offer? Now, it is not a one-side effort, but two-way traffic where I listen AND I am being heard. This has left me with only a handful of people, with whom I can talk without any fear of judgment. Yesterday, I had a call with my friend, and the after-effects were therapeutic. I think that it’s the same for her because she makes a conscious effort to call me amidst her busy schedule. For me, the definition of friendship has evolved. And I get bits and pieces of it from those handfuls of people. For you, it can be something else. What is important is to be aware that anything that brings joy needs to be accepted, and the opposite has to be discarded. Life is too short to spend time with anything/anyone that drains you.

I would not hesitate to fire such a person, which is exactly what I did when several of my husband’s employees refused to work alone with women. I had to step in to manage the construction company my husband Tony took over when his dad retired, as he had recently started his own business. One of the problems I had to deal with was a bunch of laborers who thought the work was beneath them. They all knew what the job entailed when they accepted it, but when they showed up to work and saw that the trained construction workers were getting paid a whole lot more and were in charge of them, they all wanted to be carpenters, painters, etc. The foremen had to fight with them to get them to stay in their lane, and they were always pestering me for promotions or raises, even after less than a month on the job. I kept them while I advertised for new laborers, and two women hesitantly replied. I made it clear that there was no possibility that they’d be promoted or receive training, though a raise was possible after three months. They were ecstatic to get 13/hour plus transportation to and from the sites, as the minimum wage here was 7. I hired them both and put each in charge of a crew of laborers, and they were getting shit done, even as they had to deal with non-stop insubordination. They spread the word, and within a month I had crews of laborers that were 80 percent female. I did not discriminate based on gender, and I hired a few new people who were men, but I had ample cause to dismiss the first batch. After that I simply hired the first suitable applicants who were willing to accept the terms, and they just happened to be mostly female. There was no longer any grumbling about how they’d rather be putting up Sheetrock, and it’s a sad reflection on our society that they were much better than the men at cleaning up. I remember watching one guy sweep the floor, and it was obvious that he measured his success by how much of the floor the broom touched; it made no difference to him if he actually picked up the thick layer of drywall dust. Things ran smoothly among the laborers. The labor forewomen were excellent at delegating, and unlike the men they weren’t afraid to lead by example. One woman in particular was careful to always do the nastiest and least desirable jobs herself (like when homeless people break in and poop in the toilets that aren’t hooked up yet), and we had several clients who were impressed when they saw how many women we employed. Sometimes running a business feels like you’ve turned the old saying on its head, and that closing the door on one problem opens a window for another one. In this case we started to have issues with the male construction workers. They were all quite happy with the women at first, because of how hard they worked, but then their male privilege started to seep in, and they began to treat the laborers as personal maids. When we had to get on to them for abusing the women by making them perform tasks outside of the scope of their responsibilities, some of the guys became resentful. They realized that they had no legitimate complaints against any of the women, so a group of the men who had been with the company for years decided to take a stand by refusing to be alone with them. None of them cited Graham, and it was before Pence, but their argument was the same: It would be improper for them to work alone with a woman when they were married. They made ridiculous demands, like wanting another male to be present if a laborer had to work in a room they were in, or the laborer had to wait until they were gone. We also offered company trucks to some of these men, and though there were vans for the laborers, I did require that anyone driving one of our vehicles pick up another employee if that made more logistical sense. Suddenly I had three men announce that they would no longer be picking up the women we asked them to, and that they would not do runs for materials with female laborers either. There were eight guys total who refused to work alone with women, and three of those drove company trucks. There’s no doubt in my mind that they thought they could get away with it and force me to get rid of the women because they had worked for the company longer than I had been alive. They were skilled workers and supervisors, and they thought they were more valuable to us than the laborers. I called them into a meeting one day and they all made excuses for not showing up, so the next day I kept their paychecks at the office and told them they’d get them after they met with me. They showed up and acted like the meeting was an opportunity to reiterate their grievances and state demands, and at that point I became excited at the prospect of firing them. I mentally reviewed all the complaints the women had filed against them, and their refusal to carry out the job they were hired to do, and I decided I was on solid ground. When I told them that they had one last chance to agree to work with whoever I assigned I was counting on them to refuse, and they did. The oldest guy who had worked there when my father-in-law started the company said that they were just exercising their religious rights and right to free expression, and that they’d all quit if I fired one of them – and they’d sue. The problem with that was that the constitution doesn’t give anyone the right to get paid for a job that they are refusing to do, and that they’d given me plenty of cause to fire them, even if I didn’t actually need it. They were incredulous when I responded by telling them that they were out effective immediately, and that they were welcome to sue though I felt they should be aware that I had documented every complaint against them and every time they refused to work. They knew well enough that they had crossed the line in the way they had spoken to their female coworkers, so that put an abrupt end to any talk of lawsuits. I was still sitting at my desk deciding who to promote to take their places, and which temporary workers I should offer permanent employment, when my father-in-law called. The guys had called him the moment they left, asking him to rein me in and whining that I was ruining the company with my feminist agenda. I told him what had happened and he cracked up laughing. Apparently the two men who had been leading the morality crusade were currently spending their paychecks in a New Orleans strip club, just as they had done every Friday for the past three decades."},{"prompt":"Will Akhilesh Yadav be able to form his government this time in the Uttar Pradesh 2022 elections?","completion":"This is yet to convert the enthusiasm of the into interested voters. Till now PM has managed to counter the rally's heads of Akhilesh Yadava. He is just young person hence usually people of young ages wanted to find their place in the crowd. Similar gatherings Mr Bisht the present CM could manage with difficulty. But BJP when spoke that the Accidental Hindu is dangerous, Mr Modi the PM got the hints that the people are now in a mood of change from Akhilesh Yadava. This is not a chance that wife of ex CM and his daughter caught the Corona. He had to leave the Vijay Ratha and attend his family having realised the shift in the focus of the present CM to the Accidental Hindu. So the chances of formation of Govt by SP is not straight way. Akhilesh Yadava has to compromise to have a kind of the Coalition he never had earlier."},{"prompt":"Why is there so much oil on the Gulf of Mexico?","completion":"The answer is very very simple. Somewhere deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico is an upwelling of magma in the mantle. This is what caused the area to sink and spread out forming the Gulf of Mexico. This upwelling brings up with it a large number of things including a lot of Methane! The Methane as it approaches the surface undergoes dehydrogenation synthesis because it encounters at fairly shallow depth a lot of catalytic compounds. In the presence of heat, pressure and these catalytic minerals the methane decomposes somewhat from CH4 to CH3 and CH2. These almost instantly polymerize into what you know as Alkanes or simply stated crude oil. Why so much. Because a lot of methane is coming up there. So much methane that it has coated the bottom of the abyssal deep there about 300 feet thick with methane hydrate. (methane ices) The amount of methane coming up there vastly exceeds any geologic fossil content of the rock by probably 100 times. Furthermore that abyssal deep is so deep there is very little fossil deposit there. So anyone claiming it is dinosaurs or algae that caused this is just wrong. It isn’t even possible. Now that you have found out why please understand that the area is fairly boiling with methane and crude oil. The seeps of oil are something close to 100,000 barrels of oil a day and may be much more. The seeps of methane are probably more every day than the entire world industry uses every day. There is no shortage and isn’t going to be one. All we do by not using this oil is that we forgo the energy we could have gotten. It doesn’t stop the CO2 in the atmosphere at all. This is not the only location that is so. These occur all around the globe. What is more it is just foolish not to use them. We are not going to run out of oil! It is in mass production all the time. Mankind just uses the oil, he doesn’t make it. For your billion year old earth people, this is a stunning proof that it isn’t that old. The process is dynamic and on going and the C-14 content indicates a geologic age of about 40,000 years. That is not possible in a billion year old earth. There would be NO C-14 in this stuff if it was that old. Take it or leave it that’s the facts. It is in fact the seeping up of methane and oil process that built our atmosphere and seas and it fed the life on earth. Even today about 30% of all the fish and sea mammals depend for their spawning and life processes on the out fall of this leaking of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. It is no threat to life, it is life!"},{"prompt":"w can we find stocks for swing trading and positional trading?","completion":"Swing and positional trading can be profitable strategies for investors looking to maximize returns without constantly monitoring the market. To find stocks for swing trading, traders often rely on technical analysis to identify trends and support and resistance levels. This can involve using tools such as moving averages and trend lines to determine entry and exit points. For positional trading, investors may focus on fundamental analysis, examining a company's financials and business model to identify stocks that are undervalued and have long-term growth potential."},{"prompt":"What do you think about President Biden's revocation of the Keystone XL Pipeline permit?","completion":"It’s a victory for US property owners.

Here are some key points to consider: High Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility, and their values can experience significant fluctuations in short periods. This volatility can present both opportunities and risks. If you're considering investing in cryptocurrencies, you should be prepared for the potential risks and price swings associated with this asset class.

However, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the cryptocurrency market is highly unpredictable. Diversification: Cryptocurrencies can provide an opportunity to diversify your investment portfolio by adding an asset class that behaves differently from traditional stocks and bonds. Diversification can help spread risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio performance. Technological Innovation: Investing in cryptocurrencies can provide exposure to blockchain technology and its potential for disrupting various industries. If you believe in the long-term transformative power of blockchain, investing in cryptocurrencies may align with your investment thesis. Regulatory and Security Risks: Cryptocurrencies operate in a relatively unregulated space, and regulatory changes can impact the market and investor sentiment. Additionally, security risks, including the potential for hacking or theft, should be carefully considered. Understanding and Research: Investing in cryptocurrencies requires a solid understanding of the technology, market trends, and the specific cryptocurrencies you're interested in. Thorough research and staying informed about the latest developments are crucial to making informed investment decisions. Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are generally considered high-risk due to the market's volatility and uncertainties. It's important to assess your risk tolerance and only invest funds that you can afford to lose. It's recommended to approach cryptocurrency investments with caution and consider seeking advice from financial professionals or experienced investors. They can provide insights tailored to your specific circumstances and help you evaluate whether investing in cryptocurrencies aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance."},{"prompt":"Why did the IMF loan money to Greece in the first place?","completion":"The reason the IMF got involved with Greece is that is what it was set up to do. The function of the IMF is to lend money to countries that have got into trouble, conditionally on their doing the things that are needed to allow them to pay back the debts. The IMF is the world specialist in this sort of thing. The ECB could of course buy out the IMF loans and take it all in itself. That would be rather like your doctor buying out the cancer specialist because you didn't like the ideas of a surgeon operation on you. The ECB brought in the IMF because they are the specialists in this sort of problem.

The bear, the scared deer, and a crazed Donald Duck as the litter bug were terms little kids understood at n emotional level.

Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"Both have their advantages and disadvantages. To begin with, in private schools class sizes are usually smaller than in public schools. This can be advantageous for students because they will be more engaged during classes and student-teacher interaction will be more efficient. Moreover, private schools are better equipped with different supplies, such as books, science equipment, and technology, while public schools usually have limited equipment and textbooks might be outdated. Better supplies give students an opportunity to better learn different subjects, thus, increasing the quality of the education that they get. However, most private schools are paid, while public schools are not. Therefore, not every student will be able to afford to attend private schools. Public schools are advantageous in the sense, that they offer a wider range of courses in different fields, like sports, arts, etc. while private schools offer more specialized courses. A wider range of courses will allow students to develop in various directions. Also, private schools usually put more pressure on students academic-wise than public schools do. This pressure can cause high levels of stress for students, which is not good for their health. Additionally, private schools have entrance exams, while public schools do not. Therefore, public schools give all students a chance to study and learn things. Overall, it depends on a student which type of school is a better choice for them."},{"prompt":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","completion":"Electricity is really NOT “Sparks and Magic”."},{"prompt":"Jared Kushner said that he can’t commit to having the presidential election on 11/3.

So, how can self-confidence help anyone?Frankly speaking, if you are asking this question to yourself, then also you ought to answer with confidence from within. You can now surely think where self-confidence helps us. Didn't get it?Okay, no problem. So, self confidence helps an individual in all aspects of his life, whether he's dating a girl or babysitting a child, Whether he's playing football or whether he's cheering up for any team, Whether he likes himself or whether he love himself. Everywhere you see yourself, it's because you had self-confidence. Then why don't you feel that you have self-confidence?Because you have never seen it that way. Try and even learn to see yourself in the situation thinking that self-confidence is helping you in that situation, and I promise that you shall soon feel self-confidence. Sometimes, confidence needs to break the walls of your soul to come out, let them come out dude! This is possible only when you will be self-introspecting yourself. This requires a initiation, just like in my case, Mr. Anga helps me to initiate it. It might take many days, even many months to let you know that you too have self confidence.

Launch missiles into the weapon ports, armed with nuclear warheads, and the ship goes down. If the aliens are more like the Galactic Empire of Star Wars, we could still use nuclear missiles to beat them. Star Wars shields, for the most part, don’t do anything to torpedos or missiles, and a nuke to the bridge and the reactor dome would end that ship’s participation really quick.

If you feel your getting abused, and sensing something isn't right whether the abuse is still on going or not, fear, embarrassment or feeling isolated may prevent you. You may want to tell someone, but you know what they will tell you to do. They'll tell you to leave, if you haven't already. If you have left they may just say “ good\\" and that's it. But some maybe willing to listen. Explaining any abuse takes a lot of courage from the abused. Trying to explain it to a friend or family member can be difficult for them to understand and for you to explain it in a comprehensive manor because everything will be so mixed up. If a friend or family member can understand you and is willing to spend time, I don't just mean an hour or so, I'm talking weeks and months because this abuse has no quick fix, then you need to try to start from the beginning and go from there. It will be upsetting, you'll go through so many emotions. You may even be in denial that it was all the narcs fault, you'll blame yourself, you may even loose temper or get annoyed with the very person who's trying to help you. It's effects are destroying you from the inside out, changing the very person you are, making you act irrationally, being constantly tired and irritable. This is what abuse does. If your friend or family member knows this behaviour isn't who you really are, they will understand and try to comfort you and listen and advise as best they can. You need moral and emotional support, friends and family members, may not be enough. You may also need professional help. When explaining your abuse, there will be so much to say and as much as you try to remain calm, you won't. You'll say so much so quickly because you need to vent it, then return back to some things you said to go over them again. You will have to relive it again by talking, but the more you talk the less this abuse will be allowed to control you. True friends and family members won't need you to explain the abuse your going through or have been through, they will already see it in you. Talking with other people who have been through a similar situation also helps and you may find it's easier to do it that way. People need people in times of truma, someone to listen, understand and advise. Explaining this abuse and it's effects takes time, a lot of time and energy, both from the abused and the person who's willing to help."},{"prompt":"Which rock band has had the most messed up/dysfunctional history?","completion":"Interesting question, but frankly, those that are probably the most dysfunctional are the least well known, simply because they didn’t last long enough to be recognized.

Some survive perpetually these days by remaining distant between infrequent engagements (Rolling Stones, The Who, Grateful Dead remnants, etc) but the toll of maintaining a lasting, cohesive relationship among creative egotistical parts-of-the-sum is a ongoing struggle.

Find local companies. Possible strategies for finding prospects: Get a Book of Lists for your town. Grab your local Chamber’s business directory, or visit the Chamber and grab one of every brochure in the rack. Or just drive through a local business park or your nearest downtown shopping district, and make a list of local business company names. If you’re just starting out in copywriting, or in Web-content writing, I recommend focusing on companies in your town. You’re more likely to be able to make a connection with a company you can come down and meet with in person. If you have a special knowledge area — legal, retail, nonprofit, accounting, whatever — further narrow your search to companies in that industry. You may not have Web content samples, but maybe you have articles, brochures or other work in their industry, which would help pave the way to convincing them you’re the writer for the assignment. How can you zero in on better-paying clients? Try to get a sense from their site of the value of what they sell. What do you think this company makes in a year? A medium-sized law firm, for instance, likely has a very healthy cash flow. A successful, growing retailer with multiple locations — same. You can also do Google searches to see if the company has gotten any press, and if so, if they mentioned company revenue. In my experience, business-to-business companies are more desirable targets than consumer-focused companies…it may be me, but they seem to more often have substantial marketing budgets. If a company sells 500,000 engines to automotive companies, they’re probably a better target than one that sells 5 toys at craft fairs. Prioritize companies that are good candidates for ongoing work — they constantly introduce new products, or want to keep a blog updated weekly. Steady clients that will have work each month are always more desirable — and end up generating more revenue — than those seeking to simply add a few new Web pages to their site and call it done. 2. Look online. Now take your list and find all the company Web sites in your target geography and industries. Take a browse through them. Shortly, it will become clear to you that some of their sites are awesome and detailed, while some have real problems. The losers have important pieces missing — no strong “About us” page, no team bios, no details on what their products or services do and how they benefit customers. Reading the site, you can’t figure out what they do, how long they’ve been in business, who their clients are, who the people are running the company. These are your prospects. 3. Prepare a pitch. Take notes about the state of the Web sites. ABC company has no verbiage whatever on their home page, just a list of links! XYZ company has no media page with press contacts. RFQ company has a blog set up, but it hasn’t been updated in three months. And so on. Create a pitch tailored for each one that goes something like this: “I’d like to introduce myself — I’m a local freelance writer. I was looking at your Web site recently, and noticed it doesn’t have ______. I’d be happy to take a few minutes to talk with you about how adding a ___ to your Web site would help drive more traffic to your site/get your company noticed/build your reputation and bring you more clients.” (If you haven’t pitched companies before, know that everything you say should tie in to the company finding more business. That is why they hire writers — they’re hoping your words will attract more customers.) 4. Call or email prospects. I’ve had good luck with both methods of reaching out, but do whatever you feel suits your personal communication style. Some writers give great phone, while some craft really catchy emails that get results. To start, identify the businesss owner (if it’s a small biz) or the marketing manager (if it’s a medium to larger one). Find their phone number or email address, and get in touch. 5. Have examples. If you don’t have examples of your own Web content work, just find a few sites that you think are well-done (by competitors of your target, ideally) so you can show them what effective content looks like and point up how their site is lacking in comparison. Business owners don’t like to feel they look lame when compared with similar businesses. 6. Be prepared to build a relationship. In my experience, your first contact with a small business about writing Web content will often not result in an instant sale (though sometimes it does!). More often, you may need to have several conversations that may string out over weeks or months as the company decides exactly what new content should be written. Start a tracking system for staying in touch periodically with these prospects. Send them interesting articles about why adding a blog would help their business…don’t necessarily hard-sell them every time you chat. Don’t invest a ton of time, as this may or may not pay off, but show you’re a useful resource who knows about how to use the Internet to help businesses grow. This week, I’m finally signing a lucrative contract with one financial-services consultant who I’ve been speaking with all year. 7. Quote a decent rate. Web-content rates are all over the map. If you’re new, start at 100 a page at least. And know that Web pages should be short — 300-400 words is plenty. If they have more to say, they should create subpages (which you should also charge 100 for!). They want blogs? Think 100 per. Pay can range up to 1 a word, 150 an hour, and more in my experience. Rates will depend on the complexity of the information you need to convey on the company site. Need to write about foreign currency trading or actuarial consulting? It’s probably going to pay more than writing about a pizza parlor. But remember: If you quote a lowball rate, you’ll write for low rates. Try to get the client to mention a budget first, and then negotiate from there. Stick to your guns on what you think is fair pay."},{"prompt":"What do you think about Joe Biden’s plan to create new manufacturing jobs and boost American production?

If human beings have had diverse and multiple chains of ancestors, there would have been noticeable difference between the [math]CO_1[/math] genes in human beings. In fact the same is the case with many other species in existence today. The rational evidence regarding origin of all humans beings from a single pair of man and woman is evident from the fact that we all have spiritual instinct (seeking some ideal), we all have a sense of morality and we all have rational method of thinking. No other species in the world has these abilities. Thus humans are a unique species like no other species in the world. It means that humans have been specifically created in this form, rather than an entire population of humans evolving “randomly” from an entire population of prehuman apes, and somehow all of them ending up having these exalted characteristics. The ultimate evidence that human beings have been created from a single pair of man and woman is what has been mentioned in the Quran: “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allāh is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing and Aware.” (Al-Quran 49:13) Our scientific knowledge may some day reach the level that we may be able to establish the same fact through scientific method, or we may never reach such level of knowledge, however what has been revealed by Allah is the ultimate truth.

Given that India is the second-largest producer of food in the world, after China, and has the ability to beat their counterpart in terms of food and agricultural growth, pursuing food processing courses is favorable for candidates. On subjects like food handling, various colleges in India offer a variety of food courses. To help you become an expert in food preparation, you can select a graduate, postgraduate, diploma, or certificate course in food processing. Instead of these drawn-out graduating and postgraduate programmes, there are food processing certification courses.

Capable of very high speed machining due to it's high heat conductivity removing frictional heat from the cutting zone. Typical machining issue is development of a build-up on the edge of the cutting tool, this can lead to tool breakage. Chip evacuation can be a problem in drills and narrow slots.Magnesium. Machinability similar to aluminium, however suffers from the issue that the swarf is flammable, very fine chips and shavings may be highly flammable if dry. Once ignited, a magnesium fire is extremely difficult to extinguish and water based fire extinguishers should never be used on magnesium. Water based flood coolant is mandatory. Mg is easy to machine from a theoretical standpoint but challenging to machine from the standpoint of fire safety.Copper- good machinability, however commercially pure copper may produce long, stringy, gummy chips. Higher strength low alloy copper such as Cu-Be or Cu-Cr alloys tend to have better machinability.Brass. Excellent machinability. Machinability rating of 100%, serves as a standard to which other materials are compared in their machinability.Bronze- depends on the alloy. Machinability generally good. Excellent with leaded bronzes…if you don't care about the hazardous waste considerations. High nickel bronzes may posess high work hardening tendency leading to tool chatter and surface glazing issues."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","completion":"Who doesn't love getting a great deal on their hotel stay?

Microsoft is. But the book? It's ok, but probably not as impressive as he made it out to be. About the book. Art of Computer Programming is a brilliant book, written by a brilliant programmer. And rather useless for a productive programmer. You have to understand, most of the time, the challenge isn't “how can we solve this in polynomial time?” or “what's the most efficient way to do this?” Don't get me wrong, understanding of fundamental of computer science is vital. But you don't answer that kind of challenge frequently. If you get it like once a year, it's already fun. After all, programmers are software engineers, not computer science researchers. Firm grasp of the science helps, just don't expect to reach into its edges too often. To put this in perspective, it's like saying “if you understand insert-a-physic-book, come work with us in General Motor.” Well, you definitely want to to know the sciences. But again, you won't be trying to rework those equations frequently. Most of the time, your challenge is “OK, we need this out next month, except you have no extra resources (and the ones you have are fully booked), while the data owner won’t be able to grant extra access and if you even think about asking for certain data, security and legal will want to grill you over (except both of them are booked up for months).” It’s time optimization, alright. But it’s time of the organization, not of the computer. Most of the time, the biggest challenge of your code isn’t “is it correct”? (goodness I hope you don’t have to think about that!) The biggest challenge of your code is either “OMG what the hell did the previous guy mean?” or “what’s the sequence of deployment which carries the least risk?” or “security demands you upgrade your runtime environment, which breaks half of the units of your product, and you have around 24h to get everything in working order.” Also, a sh*t load of “correctness” problem isn’t about the code per se, but about everything else. Think about the concept of “test flakiness” (i.e. tests failing randomly). As far as most of computer science is concerned, such thing is… against the spirit of computer science. However, tests and production fail for a variety of reasons outside of the code. The computer craps out (because it’s a hot day and the damned thing overheat? because the other tenants of your racks get higher priority? because OMG how many customers did you say we have this launch?). Networks randomly corrupt your data, just because. Some sloppy newbie programmers (read: you at 2AM trying to rescue some data) introduce bad code (or, worse yet, insert some wrongly formatted data). None of these problems can be accounted for by an elegant proof that your algorithm is correct. I mean, they can, and should, be accounted for, but through a process called “elbow grease” wherein you painstakingly put in contingency code for every, single, edge, cases. See how Art of Computer Programming doesn’t help? So the book is ok, but not vital. Then why did Bill Gates mention it? There are 2 main reasons, I think. First, since the book is pretty dense, he wants to advertise the fact that he (and Microsoft) highly values people who can process that kind of information. Second, he also wants to show Microsoft to be a highly desirable place to work, and only the smartest are allowed. In short, PR. I mean, I know there is Microsoft Research, which is rumored to be pretty into stretching the limit of computer science. But regular departments? Look, Windows is full of hacks and backward-bending for certain programs to work. And let’s not talk about Office (and the atrocity that is VBA). So the book is probably useless there. Again, the “optimization” is all about the org, not the algorithm. A slower algorithm but easier to understand is, about 99% of the time, desirable. It’s all PR."},{"prompt":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","completion":"Its not that Kannadiga's are least known. The main reasons are. 1. Its a intentional ignorance. 2.

Could Flanders ever become independent or join the Netherlands in the future?","completion":"Reporting from the dark side here. No more playing Santa using tax money to buy minority votes.No more double standards with respect to minorities’ religion. Catholicism has been completely mocked, ridiculed and demonized. Nuns have been bullied out of the boards of the charities they themselves built with their bare hands. By whom? Smug uber-secularist knowitall types. The same types who have got absolutely no problem with rabid religious conservatism when it happens to come from Muslims. You know, because Allah is real and God is not. On more than one occasion, Muslims from the Belgian far Left (most of whom have double nationality) have been exposed of having ties to the far right wing in their ancestral countries. “Et alors?”No more “shushing” the right. Whenever someone sticks up for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), immediately he or she is accused of being a monster because of a totally unrelated issue, such as child poverty. (That’s the latest incarnation of that argument.) Actually it is related: Without these SMEs and the >50% total tax rate they already pay, there would not be any money to alleviate child poverty.No more pretending you don’t know what communism is or does. If you are going to levy a ginormous corporate tax rate on those big evil multinational corporations, they will all simply go away.No more sitting on one’s Leftist high horse while collaborating with the PS, who steal from the homeless; or Ecolo, who are a crypto conservative Muslim party but lack the bravery and decency to advertize it in the open. No more shouting “Nazi” 24/7 or comparing contemporary Jews with Nazis in the Dossin barracks. Learn some manners. All of these points are left v. right wing, but those supposedly right-wing issues (rather than romantic nationalism) is what is actually driving the separatist movement… Honestly, Bart De Wever as prime minister would be in the best interest of Belgicists (unitary Belgians). But the PS won’t ever allow it unless he’d go on his knees in front of Magnette. Somebody needs to tell the PS that this isn’t the 19th century anymore, if that somebody actually cares about the preservation of Belgium. Most people don’t care about nationalism either way (pro Flemish or pro Belgian). It’s about “bread and butter” issues for them. So if Flemish independence means a better government and more accountability in our politics… That’s a wholly different way of looking at it. Most secessions happen for “bread and butter issues” to begin with! About a union with the Netherlands in the event of an independent Flanders… I think there would be an immediate demand for increased cooperation in the field of transportation and perhaps education. But in terms of “communication culture”, the Netherlands is rather direct, while Flanders is almost Asian (think 10 things before you say 1 thing)… Also, dialect-wise and culturally, the Netherlands is more homogenized than Flanders. Our regional identities mean a lot to us. We won’t give up on that, or settle for a watered-down version. It would, in short, require a huge attitude shift from the Netherlands and I’m not sure they would like that."},{"prompt":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

The eccentric characters and unique locations of Craig's world could be transformed into outlandish post-apocalyptic landscapes, blending the colorful charm of \\"Craig of the Creek\\" with the dystopian atmosphere of \\"Borderlands.\\" In this crossover, Craig and his friends could find themselves mysteriously transported into the chaotic and dangerous world of Pandora, the setting of the \\"Borderlands\\" games. They would encounter iconic characters from the game series, such as the Vault Hunters, Claptrap, and the charismatic yet dangerous Handsome Jack. Together, Craig and his friends would navigate the treacherous environments of Pandora, facing off against hostile creatures and bandit factions. While Craig and his friends may not possess the same combat skills as the Vault Hunters, their resourcefulness, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities could prove invaluable in overcoming challenges and helping them survive in this unfamiliar and hostile world. The crossover could explore themes of friendship, resilience, and the power of imagination in the face of adversity. It could also inject humor and lightheartedness into the often gritty and violent world of \\"Borderlands,\\" providing a unique blend of action, adventure, and heartfelt moments. Overall, a crossover between \\"Craig of the Creek\\" and \\"Borderlands\\" could offer a fresh and exciting mashup of these two distinct universes, bringing together the imaginative spirit of Craig's neighborhood with the explosive and unpredictable world of Pandora."},{"prompt":"The Mahabhar","completion":"\\"Vasudeva said, Great is the joy I feel. Listen to me, Dhananjaya! This that I will tell thee will immediately dispel thy sorrow and infuse delight into thy heart. O thou of great splendour, know, O Dhananjaya, that Karna, his dart being baffled through Ghatotkacha, is already slain in battle. The man does not exist in this world that could not stay before Karna armed with that dart and looking like Kartikeya in battle. By good luck, his (natural) armour had been taken away. By good luck, his earrings also had been taken away. By good luck, his infallible dart also is now baffled, through Ghatotkacha. Clad in (natural) coat of mail and decked with his (natural) ear-rings, Karna, who had his senses under control, could singly vanquish the three worlds with the very gods. Neither Vasava, nor Varuna the lord of the waters, nor Yama, could venture to approach him. Indeed, if that bull among men had his armour and ear-rings, neither thyself, bending the Gandiva, nor myself, uplifting my discus, called Sudarsana, could vanquish him in battle. For thy good, Karna was divested of his ear-rings by Sakra with the help of an illusion. Similarly was that subjugator of hostile towns deprived of his (natural) armour. Indeed, because Karna, cutting off his (natural) armour and his brilliant car-rings, gave them unto Sakra, it is for that he came to be called Vaikartana. Karna now seems to me to be like an angry snake of virulent poison stupefied by power of [LINKED_TEXT: incantation] [URL: https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/errata.htm#114], or like a fire of mild flames. From that time, O mighty-armed one, when the high-souled Sakra gave that dart unto Karna in exchange for the latter's ear-rings, and celestial armour, that dart, viz., which has slain Ghatotkacha, from that time, Vrisha, having obtained it, had always regarded thee as slain in battle! But though [LINKED_TEXT: deprived] [URL: https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/errata.htm#115] of that dart, O sinless one, I swear to thee that hero is still incapable of being slain by anybody else save thee. Devoted to Brahmanas, truthful in speech, engaged in penances, observant of vows, kind even unto foes, for these reasons Karna is called Vrisha. Heroic in battle, possessed of mighty arms and with bow always uplifted, like the lion in the forest depriving leaders of elephantine herds of their pride, Karna always deprives the greatest car-warriors of their pride on the field of battle, and resembles the mid-day sun at whom none can gaze. Contending with all the illustrious and foremost of warriors of thy army, O tiger among men, Karna, while shooting his arrowy showers, looked like the autumnal sun with his thousand rays. Indeed, incessantly shooting showers of shafts like the clouds pouring torrents of rain at the end of summer, Karna is like a pouring cloud charged with celestial weapons. He is incapable of being vanquished in battle by the gods, he would mangle them in such a way that their flesh and blood would fall copiously on the field. Deprived, however, of his armour as also of his car-rings, O son of Pandu, and divested also of the dart given him by Vasava, Karna is now like a man (and no longer like a god). There win occur one opportunity for his slaughter. When his car-wheels will sink in the earth, availing thyself of that opportunity, thou shouldst slay him in that distressful situation. I will make thee a sign beforehand. Warned by it, thou shouldst act. The vanquisher of Vala himself, that foremost of heroes, wielding his thunder, is incapable of slaying the invincible Karna while the latter stands weapon in hand. Indeed, O Arjuna, for thy good, with the aid of diverse contrivances I have slain, one after another, Jarasandha and the illustrious ruler of the Chedis and the mighty-armed Nishada of the name of Ekalavya There are still many instances.

We simply experience the universe as it evolves from an initial state in one direction only, never in reverse. We have no idea as to why that is. We can conjecture several explanations that look like reasons: our universe obeys laws of causality and to travel back in time would be to break them is one of them; travelling back through time would require going faster than light and that is not possible is another. Yet these aren’t actual reasons as to why it would be impossible to experience time in reverse, they’re at most mechanics how the impossibility is achieved.

They start facing problems in the subject which dearth the preparation. Students generally can’t give their attention on the main aim and always jumps to different goals. Instead of concentrating on different goals, first, think about one goal and work on it whether it is GATE, CAT, MAT, and GRE anything with your full attention. Never focus on another goal when you focus on one. #2 Improper management of time Many students make time table to study but they do not continue to reply on that timetable. It is because of making a tough timetable and fails to work on it. You must solve those questions first which you know confidently in GATE exam. It is very important to give equal time to every question you can solve to GATE exam. Otherwise, at the end, you will not get a time to solve other question. #3 Lack of practice GATE requires continues the practice to score good marks. You must practice a lot for GATE exam and try to increase you speed of solving the question. Give time in solving a variety of different problems rather than practices similar type of questions. Go through mock tests when you complete the course as much as you can to grab your understanding and level. #4 Less knowledge about the course syllabus of examination pattern Many of students do not aware of the negative marking in GATE exam and get attempt all questions. Some have no clue about the cut-off marks for the examination. Some of them just study which they like in the syllabus and think that question will come from that part only and ignore the difficult parts of the syllabus. You must know that proper pattern and syllabus of GATE exam in order to clear GATE 2017 and do not ignore the hard subject rather start practicing on it. #5 Giving too much time on less important topics Some students have a habit of wasting more time on topics which carry a few marks and leave the main important topics. You must know the important topics which score more marks in GATE exam. The better ways are to make a list of topics on a page and make a priority according to carry more marks. #6 Difficult to follow online exam As GATE is now conducted online exam, so it has been difficult for that student who has the habit of giving offline exams like with paper and pencil. I suggest students to start giving exams online like a mock tests, quizzes Etc. If you practice online then it won’t be a problem for the student to face the difficulties in GATE 2017 and also helps in manage time and strategies to solve in the exam.

It offers a range of advantages over traditional CMS options and has become an essential tool for modern website and application development. Whether you're an individual blogger, a small business owner, or a large enterprise, understanding why you need to use a Headless CMS is crucial for staying ahead in today's digital landscape. First and foremost, a Headless CMS provides unparalleled flexibility. Unlike traditional CMS platforms that tightly couple the content management and presentation layers, a Headless CMS decouples them completely. This means that the content is stored separately from the front-end presentation, allowing you to deliver content to multiple channels and devices seamlessly. Whether it's a website, a mobile app, a smart device, or even a virtual reality experience, a Headless CMS empowers you to serve your content anywhere and in any format you desire. Also read: [LINKED_TEXT: Best CMS development services] [URL: https://digitaltechworks.com/cms-development/] Furthermore, Headless CMS enables a more efficient content creation and publishing process. With a traditional CMS, content authors and editors are often confined to using the built-in tools and templates, which can be restrictive and time-consuming. In contrast, a Headless CMS allows content creators to work with their preferred tools and workflows, such as popular text editors or specialized content creation software. This flexibility streamlines the content creation process, enhances productivity, and fosters collaboration among team members. Another crucial benefit of using a Headless CMS is its scalability. As your digital presence grows and evolves, you may need to accommodate new platforms, devices, or even integrate emerging technologies. A Headless CMS excels in this regard by providing a future-proof foundation. Since the presentation layer is decoupled, you can update or replace it without affecting the underlying content structure. This scalability ensures that your content remains adaptable to changing user expectations and technological advancements. Moreover, a Headless CMS enables faster and more efficient front-end development. With the separation of content and presentation, developers can focus solely on building robust front-end experiences without the constraints imposed by a traditional CMS. They have the freedom to choose their preferred development frameworks, libraries, and tools, which ultimately leads to faster development cycles and enhanced user experiences. Security is another crucial aspect where a Headless CMS shines. By decoupling the presentation layer, the attack surface for potential vulnerabilities is significantly reduced. Traditional CMS platforms often have a large codebase and various plugins or themes, making them more susceptible to security breaches. On the other hand, a Headless CMS typically has a smaller and more focused codebase, reducing the potential risks and increasing the overall security posture of your digital assets. In conclusion, the benefits of using a Headless CMS are numerous and impactful. Its flexibility, efficiency, scalability, development speed, and security advantages make it an indispensable tool for modern content management and delivery. Whether you're a blogger, an e-commerce business, or an enterprise-level organization, embracing a Headless CMS can transform the way you create, manage, and distribute content across various channels and platforms. To harness the full potential of a Headless CMS, it's essential to partner with a top-notch CMS development company. Such a company possesses the expertise, experience, and technical know-how to assist you in implementing and optimizing your Headless CMS solution. Whether it's customizing the CMS to align with your unique requirements, integrating third-party services, or providing ongoing support, a [LINKED_TEXT: top-notch CMS development company] [URL: https://digitaltechworks.com/cms-development/] can ensure that you leverage the full power of a Headless CMS to elevate your digital presence and achieve your business objectives."},{"prompt":"f I proved th","completion":"You have my greatest sympathy.

I saw an article on Facebook yesterday, about a man who had been gored and killed by a deer he was hunting. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #MvIgc]I knew what was coming, but I still decided to look at the comment section. A solid 90% of it was people making jokes about it, but also (100% seriously) saying he deserved it, they’re glad the deer “won” etc. Now, it wasn’t the exact article linked above, but it basically said the same thing. Not much detail, only that he was a hunter in Arkansas. Have I ever been hunting? No. Do I hate the idea of trophy hunting? Yes, it’s one of my least favourite things. If someone got killed by a lion or an elephant or a rhino they were illegally hunting, would I find that schadenfreude slightly amusing? Probably, yeah. But this wasn’t any of those things. This was a man legally hunting a deer and, most likely, he was going to eat it. Nothing in the article said he was hunting for “sport”, as many commenters said. I just don’t understand the knee-jerk reaction to vilify someone and mock their death for hunting their food, especially as the majority of commenters were most likely meat-eaters themselves. I made a comment, saying it was slightly hypocritical of people who eat meat to laugh about a hunter’s death, when they have no issues picking up meat from the supermarket. Even people who don’t eat meat can surely see that it is a more sustainable and less environmentally-damaging way to consume animals. If deer are allowed to be hunted, the population is surely healthy, and in some areas, overpopulation is actually a problem, because, without enough predators, the population will explode, and then deer will starve and die anyway. (In lots of cases, we’re responsible for this lack of predators, which I’m not thrilled about, but having made this situation we have a responsibility to keep the ecosystem in balance.) “Hunting is evil” is a sweeping generalisation and it makes me a bit irritated that some people can’t put themselves in someone else’s shoes. “Man who goes out to feed family” is not the same as “twat who goes fox hunting” or “person who pays thousands of dollars and travels to the other side of the world to shoot lion.” The example I used was: what if there’s a person who lives in e.g. remote Alaska, who hunts elk once a year and then sticks the whole animal in the freezer, where it provides many months’ worth of food? They might live miles from the nearest settlement, and rely on hunting for the bulk of their protein for themselves and their family. Of course, I also said he could just be someone who liked killing things, but nothing in the article gave that impression. Someone told me to “fuck off” and that they were “laughing into their bacon sandwich” about the man’s death. That person thinks they are the good guy. Another commenter (not replying directly to me) said they were laughing at the man and all of his family and friends. This guy’s FB profile indicated that he was keen on tolerance, social justice, etc. Nothing wrong with that, but I just find it slightly hypocritical to preach tolerance then laugh at a recently widowed woman, and potentially kids who no longer have a father. (I don’t think it mentioned whether he had children.) It’s easy to say hunting is evil when you’ve never had to hunt. If I lived in the rural USA, maybe I would be hunting for my food. If I were an Inuit, I’d probably be killing whales, or seals. I watched a documentary about (I think) the Faroe Islands and they were snapping the necks of sea birds and ripping their heads off. It was a rare time of year when they could catch them, so they actually had a much-needed source of calories for the following weeks/months. As much as I have a visceral reaction to seeing animals killed, I do understand that these people rely on this to survive, and they’re making a small dent compared to commercial methods of farming/fishing. I’m sure that some people living in their comfortable apartment in the city will be happy to call these people monsters, but I just think it shows how out of touch some people are. We’re still part of nature, and part of nature involves prey animals getting killed. Maybe one day we’ll get some delicious, affordable lab-grown meat that means we don’t have to kill animals, but until then, one dude hunting a deer isn’t the problem. I do care about animals and conservation, but eating non-endangered animals isn’t in conflict with my own moral code. If you choose not to eat meat for moral and/or environmental reasons I totally respect that, but when people say someone deserves to die for hunting their food, that’s a complete mystery to me. You can’t say life is precious and then insinuate that human life is worthless. I’m not a saint, but at least I know I’m not. I do think we need to slow down on the consumption of meat and improve living conditions for animals we farm. I know I don’t have to eat meat to survive, but then again I’m not on Facebook making fun of someone’s death while somehow feeling righteous about it. I’d just like people to try and empathise a bit before getting the pitchforks out online.

At one point they tell us that dinosaurs were all wiped out by a comet or an asteroid 66 million years ago. And then they turn right around and say they evolved into birds. Well, which is it?

Why or why not?","completion":"Karma is all about your work, action and the intent with which it is executed. In simple words “as you sow shall you grow”. If you do good work in your life you will find good fruits and if you do bad things bad things will follow. There is no time limit for the return gift. Here intent also counts. I do believe in Karma. I will narrate one live incident, for a change it is a good Karma that has happened to one of my uncles. One of my uncles son was my classmate during my school days. My uncle is very nice and witty person. His mother was very homely, hospitable and kind lady. We used to call her aayi (grandmother). There are no words to explain her love for me or for anyone. Such a divine lady suffered with a severe paralytic stroke and she lost her consciousness. After hospitalisation and good treatment she recovered to the extent of breathing normally. She could not speak, not recognise or could tell in any way she wants water, food or wants to use toilet. It was very bad condition but she survived. My uncle’s wife (mami) took care of her. She with her co-sister (and their husbands)looked after her mother-in-law so well that the woman health improved but the woman condition remained exact same. Every evening they familiar with get right up 3 x consequently and used to offer sleep pan. Morning familiar with offer bathtub and feed the woman morning meal, lunch and dinner. She existed for twenty five many years in this exact same problem. They never when complained. Inspite of being in bed for quarter of a hundred years she didn’t have just one sleep soar. ( liquid bedrooms were not heard during those times) All four forfeited their particular life on her behalf but never ever affected due to their jobs. today, my uncles and aunts are 80+ many years and are also good but are enduring age related conditions. My friend’s(uncle’s son) partner and friend takes care of my uncles and aunts so well that every time I-go to see all of them they inform us they own the most effective daughter in law, she takes care of them like a baby. They always say that they have the blessings associated with the departed soul whom they served with no objectives. Great Karma has come returning to all of them. Within period that is an unusual case of humanity and love. Presently, we see kids leaving their particular moms and dads, sending all of them to senior years homes.

Both times, the answers were about having a crush on my boss. Since I am in the process of leaving that job, I may remove anonymity on those answers. I wouldn't have been fired for what I wrote, but on the off chance that my boss found me here (it's not impossible; I sometimes post Quora links on Twitter and I have a distinctive name) it would have made the working environment uncomfortable if he had known I was attracted to him. We were the only two people working out of our satellite office, and I definitely didn't want us to become awkward with one another, especially since he was my teacher before he asked me to come and work with him. Now, he probably wouldn't care that I used to fancy him. He might even be flattered. I think on the whole, most popular Quora users don't go anonymous much.

What do you make of this statement?","completion":"All languages are grammar-less as long as we don’t try to formalize their functioning. People are able to talk in their primary language without having any knowledge about grammar. Children can talk pretty well long before they learn anything about grammar. Grammar is a formal model of how the language works. It can be descriptive or normative. Adults learning a second language generally rely upon normative grammar. This is the reason why any language other than one’s primary language is generally seen as having a much more complex grammar than one’s primary language. Richard Grant White probably meant that all other languages have a more complex grammar than English, because he didn’t need grammar to speak English (although he certainly mastered this subject). Think about languages that are said to have a much more complex grammar than English, such as Finish or Chinese. There is no doubt that a English native will have much more problem to learn these than they had to learn their primary language. But the only reason is that they learn them using grammar. Three years old Finish or Chinese kids, on the other hand, have no problem because they don’t rely upon grammar to learn the language. Of course, some will argue that people having absolutely no knowledge of grammar do not speak their own primary language very well. But this is a fallacy. A language is what people talk. Normative grammar (which allow determining who speaks “well” and who doesn’t) is just descriptive grammar of the past, and/or of a dominant class, promoted to a norm. The real language is what people produce, how “wrong” it may sound to some."},{"prompt":"My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble.

Does anyone have any comments?","completion":"I have a theory that Gamma-ray bursts are really planets setting off imploded cylindrical uranium, gun type nuclear devices and gamma ray lazing. Does anyone have any comments? Yes. Don't elaborate on the details of your “theory” here on Quora. Instead, read up the vast literature on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Look up review articles that summarize the observations carried out in the past 54 years. Then, sit down and explain them one by one with your “theory.” You will realize that your “theory” will now need to incorporate numbers, and hence equations, and physics that is already known, tested, and understood. If you do not know that physics, you will have to work hard and get to the bottom of it. Only then can you proceed with formalizing your “theory” to be able to make any quantitative comparison of available GRB data with your idea. If you can explain the observations, and by that I mean match the numbers predicted from your “theory” with all the data and various quantitative features of GRBs reported in literature, then write up your findings in the form of a paper and submit it to a well-ranked journal that publishes findings in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Hope for the best. If you manage to get it published via the rigorous process of peer-review, you will realize that the paper will add to the already existing set of theories explaining gamma-ray bursts. Nevertheless, you will become a scientist in the relatively small field of GRBs, possibly attracting collaboration, funds and projects. Go to relevant conferences and present your good work. Keep it up over the years to test the validity of the new theory as more observations of GRBs are reported. If you cannot take your idea to the level of making quantitative comparisons with data, then please do not call it a “theory.”"},{"prompt":"Can you live in SF Bay Area without a car?","completion":"Aside from San Francisco, Oakland is the only place I would consider living without a car.

So I’d suggest that there isn’t a definitive answer to your question. At any given time, points could be worth more than miles, or vice versa. There is, however, a general convention in which a credit card point can be redeemed for .01 in cashback or statement credit, and a credit card mile can be redeemed for a .01 credit against airline charges posted to your card. Within this strict confine, the value of each is equivalent. But, going back to Gerber’s point, he identifies exactly why I typically avoid cards with either point or mile reward accrual. Instead, I largely stick with cards that earn a fixed stated reward (not points), or ones that award airline mileage with a specific airline. In the latter case, airline cards (such as Barclay’s Aviator — Amer Air), still present the vulnerability that the miles necessary to issue a given reward ticket can change. However, at least this is a vulnerability that I’ve already assumed in choosing to participate in that frequent flyer award program. Under this scenario, a limited amount of math is necessary to optimally allocate my personal expenses across my credit cards. Take the following 3 cards in my wallet: Citi Double Cash: 2% cash rebate against all charges Citi Professional: 1% general cash rebate, 3% on dining/travel/office supplies (I’ve simplified a tad here) Barclays Aviator Silver: 95 fee … only used for American Air charges, on which I’m awarded 3 AAdvantage (frequent flyer program) miles. Given my redemption experience over time, I’m confident of securing .014 value for each AA mile I redeem. It should be clear that in this case, I hold 1 AA mile to be equivalent to .014 cashback from the other two cards. In my personal credit card spend, I’m going to favor the Citi Prof for the 3% earn categories, the Aviator for American Airlines purchases, and the Double Cash for all other credit card expenditures. So one postscript: I actually actively use Chase Sapphire Reserve for all my dining and travel spend now (rather than Citi Prof). It’s a points-based card. Now that goes directly against my stated preference to avoid cards that award “points”. I’ve made an exception in this case because, even with a hefty annual fee, my annual spend on those categories yields very hefty reward credits … The card grants a 3% point reward on those categories. Further, when you redeem the point value (1 pt = .01) towards travel booked on their designated booking site (very similar to Expedia, etc.), they boost the amount credited from redemption of points by 50%. In other words, the ultimate rebate earned on dining/travel spend is 4.5%. Since I actively redeem accrued points by booking travel through their portal, I’ve limited my risk to a revision to point value. Chase Sapphire Reserve had yielded the strongest reward benefits of any card I’ve ever held, even after netting out the annual fee."},{"prompt":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

Assyrians are the indigenous people of Iraq and most of Syria, a large part of Turkey, and parts of the west of what is today Iran.

How does that work?","completion":"It all comes down to the drainage that the plants soil has. If it’s in a small container with no drainage, the water won’t go anywhere and it will make the roots rot. But if it’s in a large container with drainage, it allows the soil to dry itself out and decreases chance of overwatering. (obv.) Not all succulents are the same, they react differently to how much water they receive. So if it rains, and you have your plants in the ground rather than in a container, you’ll have decent drainage and gives your plants a deep root system which is good. But This all depends on how much rain the plant receives . It still could drown the plant. A day or so of moderate rain probably won’t kill your plant. If by prolonged you mean a few days or possibly a week, your succulent might be in trouble. Edit: this is mostly based on personal experience"},{"prompt":"f Kim Jongun is dead, then why aren't they declaring it in the open?","completion":"Back in 1975 there was a brand new comedy show called NBC’s Saturday Night. One of the regular segments featured this fellow who would read satirical news stories And one of the bits that was an immediate hit was his riff on this fellow Francisco Franco, the dictator of Spain. A typical segment would be “This just in! Generalísimo Francisco Franco of Spain is still dead. More to come.” Franco’s death, like Stalin’s death 20 years earlier, put his immediate allies into turmoil. Technically, Franco had a clear successor, Prince Juan Carlos, the son of the previous King of Spain. However, Franco had been in charge for 40 years at this point and despite the fact Franco had trusted Juan Carlos, things were not as they seemed. You see, Juan Carlos had double crossed Franco. While outwardly supporting Franco and his policies, he had secretly been meeting with oppositon leaders to arrange a peaceful transition back to democracy. When rumours (that were totally true) of Franco’s death started to leak out, the people who had been loyal to him suddenly saw themselves as looking down the barrel of return to the rule of law. Franco’s loyalists still controlled the military, but staging a military coup of the new King at the moment of Franco’s death was not really a viable option. After all, you can’t stage a coup when the King hasn’t even taken charge yet. So, in a blatant attempt to keep their authority when it was crumbling around them, Franco’s loyalists claimed that Franco was just fine thank you very much and that they still held their own offices. However, eventually the truth won out. Juan Carlos finally took control of the government and pushed the Franco loyalists aside, replacing them with hand picked reformers. Now, it appears that rumours of Kim Jong Un’s death are much exaggerated at this point. South Korean intelligence is already on record as saying that they would expect to see certain things happen if Kim had died which haven’t happened. However, if Kim did die and it wasn’t clear who should succeed him, the military and civilian leaders who feared for their jobs would probably try to keep it under wraps as long as possible."},{"prompt":"Out of the many techniques in creating graphene and carbon nanotubes (which is a very difficult task in of itself), what is the most easiest and simplest out of them all?","completion":"Scotch tape and a pencil."},{"prompt":"Why did Melinda Gates say choosing to divorce Bill was her 'lowest moment?","completion":"Melinda chose to divorce bill because of the huge tax they were paying as husband and wife. that is the reason Melinda say choosing the divorce bill was he lowest moment"},{"prompt":"w can I get a call history of any number?","completion":"Call history or CDRs in telco’s language is not available just like that.

They help in the sense that they create work but that's about all."},{"prompt":"Theoretically, isn’t it possible for two species which are distantly related to come to appear closer related by the genome converging and mutating to be more alike?","completion":"Depends on your idea of appearing closely related. In reality selection doesn’t work on the genome but on characters, what is called phenotype. Actually for every molecule, say an enzyme, coded by a gene, many other sequences are possible coding for exactly the same, identical enzyme (see codon synonyms). On the other hand for every enzyme possessing some particular function there are potentially millions of very different enzymes capable of exactly the same function. As a consequence, even when a particular character of two distantly related species converges phenotypically under selection, the probability that an exactly identical molecule has been selected to realize this character is extremely small, and even in the case of this incredible coincidence, the probability that this molecule is coded by an exactly identical sequence is abysmally tiny. All together, two distanctly related species can, and routinely do, become more and more similar to the eye by convergent evolution, but I would exclude the practical possibility that they also become so similar at the genome level that they give the false impression of being more closely related than they are in reality."},{"prompt":"As a proud Texan, I believe that for profit healthcare is the best system, it allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies.

Although the more academically minded people can’t stand the environment after a while. I don’t think a true prodigy would abandon their field after a 7 year PHD or weigh compensation as heavily. In this, Goldman also recruits the all-rounders of the PHD subset who are flexible enough to work in IBanking. I think after the banking regulations and diminishing bonuses, the environment has changed in the last 10 years where IBanks like Goldman can no longer attract the best/brightest.

This question itself, has a built-in falsehood at it’s very core. The “Americans” did NOT “decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms.” That’s to start with. Look back and you’ll see, if you are honest, that there was never a vote taken of the whole of the American people, about what is commonly called the Second Amendment. Never. Instead, a small group of representatives, ALSO not selected by general plebiscite, decided amongst their VERY disunited selves, to ALLOW the inclusion of the Second into the Constitution. Even right after the Revolution, leading Americans were already making up, and believing in myths about what had just happened. The fact that a large number of the grievances claimed against the British government were exaggerations, or outright falsehoods, was forgotten; the reasons for the relative success of the Revolution itself were forgotten or misinterpreted (again, for propaganda reasons). And most of all, even the so-called “Founding Fathers” themselves, recognized AT THE TIME THEY WERE ASSEMBLING THE GOVERNMENT AND WRITING THE CONSTITUTION, that they were far from being saintly and brilliantly wise leaders of a great people. Much of the reason for the odd phrasings in the Constitution, are due to their being UNABLE to agree on all sorts of things. Including this “right to keep and bear arms.” And that’s probably why even to this day, almost NO ONE AT ALL truly believes in an entirely unlimited “right to weaponry.” If a majority truly did believe such, then it would be entirely acceptable right now, for your neighbor to plant mines all along the fence between you, and for them to erect a loaded cannon, and keep it pointed at your bedroom at all times."},{"prompt":"What is a dofollow backlink?","completion":"A No-Follow link is exactly the opposite of a Do-Follow link as such the link attributes do not allow the Google bots to follow them.

However, it's important to note that sustainable and long-term weight loss is generally more effective and healthier for your body than rapid weight loss. If you're looking to lose weight quickly, here are some tips to consider: 1. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: Before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, it's recommended to consult a doctor or a registered dietitian. They can provide personalized guidance based on your individual health needs. 2. **Create a Calorie Deficit**: Weight loss ultimately comes down to burning more calories than you consume. Calculate your daily calorie needs and aim to create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. 3. **Healthy Eating**: Focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-calorie beverages. 4. **Portion Control**: Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excessive amounts. 5. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking enough water can help control your appetite and support your metabolism. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day. 6. **Regular Exercise**: Engage in a combination of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, cycling) and strength training (using weights or resistance bands). Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days. 7. **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**: HIIT workouts involve short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief rest periods. These workouts can help you burn calories more efficiently in a shorter amount of time. 8. **Get Enough Sleep**: Sleep plays a crucial role in weight management and overall health. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. 9. **Manage Stress**: High stress levels can contribute to weight gain. Practice stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or deep breathing. 10. **Avoid Liquid Calories**: Be cautious with high-calorie drinks like sugary sodas, energy drinks, and excessive fruit juices. Opt for water, herbal tea, or other low-calorie beverages. 11. **Track Your Progress**: Keep a record of your food intake, exercise, and weight loss progress. This can help you stay accountable and make necessary adjustments. 12. **Limit Processed Foods**: Processed foods are often high in calories, unhealthy fats, and sugars.

We don't think of it particularly as different until we discuss or refer to an outside source or country. English or British sit closely together but local dialects and usage change the understanding of words and phrases to help the users feel more comfortable.

In my experience, the most useful strategy to learn English pronunciation is to repeat after the model pronunciation using the correct position of tongue, lips and jaw for each English sound. Later work on fluency and articulation. First, record yourself in order to see how you sound to others. Then, identify your mistakes and correct them, practise the correct form, and then record yourself again. Repetition is the key. The reason why we struggle with English punctuation is two-fold: 1. Not all English sounds exist in our native language and we are not sure how to produce them correctly.2. Our speech organs are trained for our native language from our childhood. When we start speaking in English, we don’t place our tongue, lips and jaw as native English speakers do. When I recorded myself in 2004 I was shocked to realize that even I could not understand what I was saying. Then, I started to look for a speech or elocution tutor who could explain how to position my tongue, lips and jaw for English sounds. I was lucky to find a top tutor in London and I fell in love with her method. We were practising accent reduction with funny sentences and verses, it was very enjoyable and extremely effective. Later, together with Linda, my tutor, we have published [LINKED_TEXT: 5 books] [URL: http://www.batcsglobal.com/british-accent-apps-and-books?__hstc=21858660.1c51716e5ff8ed3a6af782ff89c863d4.1586548688747.1601292997695.1601312670874.545&__hssc=21858660.4.1601312670874&__hsfp=1214202326] to master English punctuation which became international bestsellers.

Here are more difficulties with English pronunciation you might have experienced: 1. Not all English vowels and diphthongs exist in other languages, you might struggle to pronounce them correctly. 2. There are 5 long and 7 short vowels In English. Long vowels do not exist in all languages and there is a tendency to shorten them. This can create a problem for others to understand what you are saying. 3. Bad articulation, in other words, weak consonants or incorrectly pronounced consonants. 4. Your intonation could be very difficult to follow, you might break phrases and make pauses in the wrong places. In order to master English pronunciation you need to : Learn and practice how to pronounce English sounds using received pronunciation (RP). RP is also sometimes called the Queen’s English, Oxford English or BBC English.Practice articulation exercises to make your consonants clear and crisp.Learn to speak in phrases rather than in separate words; knowing how to link words together correctly.Learn patterns of English intonation and vocal techniques.

Every atom in nature has these same characteristics. The number of proton(positive)charged parts of nuclide determines it's identity. Example hydrogen has 1 proton(positive charge). Helium has 2 protons(positive charges) Lithium has 3 protons (positive charges) etc to Uranium which has 92. We from magnets positives repel one another,and attract negatives. Bible tells me that God holds everything together. Obviously multiple positive forces against one another would make things fall apart. We call the energy force of God binding energy. Found in every multiple proton nuclide. Oviously more binding energy in larger proton concentration elements. Takes major binding energy to hold Uranium together with 92 proton.

Why? Because China is all about conflicts, every now and then. Let me quote some facts while I say this. Sikkim conflict in 1967:- * In late 1967, there were two more conflicts between Indian and Chinese forces at their contested border, in Sikkim. The first conflict was dubbed the \\"Nathu La Incident\\", and the other the \\"Cho La Incident\\". * In September 1967, Chinese and Indian forces clashed at Nathu La. On 11 September, Chinese troops opened fire on a detachment of Indian soldiers tasked with protecting an engineering company that was fencing the North Shoulder of Nathu La. * This escalated over the next five days to an exchange of heavy artillery and mortar fire between the Indian and Chinese forces. Sixty-two Indian soldiers were killed. * Soon afterwards, Indian and Chinese forces clashed again in the Chola incident. On 1 October 1967, some Indian and Chinese soldiers had an argument over the control of a boulder at the Chola outpost in Sikkim (then a protectorate of India), triggering a fight that escalated to a mortar and heavy machine gun duel. * On 10 October, both sides again exchanged heavy fire. While Indian forces would sustain eighty-eight troops killed in action with another 163 troops wounded, China would suffer more casualties, with 300 killed and more than 200 wounded in Nathu La, as well as forty in Chola. China in Jan.1994:- * In January 1994, Beijing announced that it not only favored a negotiated solution on Kashmir, but also opposed any form of independence for the region. * Talks were held in New Delhi in February aimed at confirming established \\"confidence-building measures\\", discussing clarification of the \\"line of actual control\\", reduction of armed forces along the line, and prior information about forthcoming military exercises. 1998 relations:- * Sino-Indian relations hit a low point in 1998 following India's nuclear tests. * Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes declared that \\"“in my perception of national security, China is enemy No 1.…and any person who is concerned about India’s security must agree with that fact\\", hinting that India developed nuclear weapons in defence against China's nuclear arsenal. * In 1998, China was one of the strongest international critics of India's nuclear tests and entry into the nuclear club. * During the 1999 Kargil War China voiced support for Pakistan, but also counseled Pakistan to withdraw its forces. 2017 Dokhlam faceoff:- * On 16 June 2017 Chinese troops with construction vehicles and road-building equipment began extending an existing road southward in Doklam, a territory which is claimed by both China as well as India's ally Bhutan. * On 18 June 2017, around 270 Indian troops, with weapon..."},{"prompt":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","completion":"you’ll be surprised"},{"prompt":"Learning programming: When is it appropriate to use UDP instead of TCP?","completion":"When correctness and completeness are not that important, or when “moving forward” is more important. (TCP requires that the sender and receiver synchronize their records. UDP doesn’t, at the cost of possible data loss.) This is useful for streaming data, non-critical telemetry (where data is resent all the time), and for simple protocols implemented in embedded devices with little memory and no time to lose. Note that you need to be careful with UDP behavior and must treat the system in the way that data can be lost anytime. Some control systems are too unsafe to be used with UDP unless serious considerations are taken. For example, if you’re running a wireless-controlled Mars rover with TCP in a low-latency network, you can use simple GO and STOP commands to control the vehicle movement. However, if you do the same in a high-latency network or using UDP, what would happen if GO command registers, but not STOP? Your rover goes off the cliff or runs over colonists! For UDP implementation, you need something like “FORWARD 5m” commands instead. It’s also why “just use UDP” is not the answer.

She explained when they get home this and that is going to happen, her son also wanted to watch TV. They made a firm agreenent, that if the dog is fed, the laundry is in the laundry room by 7, he will be allowed to watch TV for 30 minutes before it's time to get ready for bed. The whole evening proceeded with no arguments, no disagreements. The family had a very calm and pleasant evening. This kind of agreement works. They use it daily in their family to eliminate misunderstandings, maintain mutual respect and set the ground rules takes away any uncertainly and anxiety about what is expected, and what happens next. The ‘agreement’ also instills in a child the moral obligation of keeping to the agreement and valuing the agreement that they made with their parent. There is no whining, no nagging and everyone agrees on family values. The kids are growing up to be reasonable, responsible and likeable teenagers now.

And despite the early disdain of the rich and powerful, the new religion quickly won over some of their number, whose spacious houses became the ancestors of some of Rome's parish churches. That said, Christianity offered a more spiritual and hopeful message, compared to classical Paganism which tended to be more about the observation of rituals."},{"prompt":"w fast could the US Air Force SR71 Blackbird fly if it pushed its engines to the point of destruction as some MiG25 Foxbats did chasing the Blackbird?","completion":"No faster, the limits are aerodynamic.

Because he’s probably humiliated at feeling like less of a “man” since it’s been made public that his wife sleeps with other guys. Because Will and Jada are among the most narcissistic people in Hollywood (and that’s saying a lot) and think the entire world need to know about every detail of their lives and then, as if everyone else is one of their personal assistants, we all should know and respond to their moods and whims in the moment. Like was today a day Jada was proclaiming to the world on national television about how she feels bald and beautiful or is she feeling touchy about her condition that day? Will was laughing along with everyone else. (There’s footage of him in his younger days making fun of a bald camera man on a talk show he was on so it’s not like he’s a stranger to insult comedy). But that night, Jada decided it wasn’t ok and that was enough for Will, who no doubt has seen all the comments about how he’s basically the worlds most famous cuckold, to decide it was an opportunity to show us all what a “man” he is. No doubt, the decision to hit Chris Rock was greatly aided by the fact that Will outweighs Rock by about 40 pounds and is half a foot taller. There isn’t a question in my mind that if Duane Johnson or Jason Momoa or Chris Hemsworth or Dave Bautista commented about Jada’s haircut (yes it’s a haircut, she shaves her head and wears no hairpiece by choice), Will would have sat kept his ass in his seat. That and the undeniable reality that wealthy people have different rules than the rest of us (believe me, if you or I hit someone at a work function, there’s not a chance we wouldn’t be arrested) allowed Will Smith to hit Chris Rock."},{"prompt":"Why are western countries including the United States publicly stating what military equipment they are sending to Ukraine?

So now that the year is 1443 it means it has been 1443 solar years since the Prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina. We have two hijri calendars. One is a lunar Hijri calendar based on the Lunar year (which is about 15 days shorter than a solar year) and for that calendar it is 1443 Lunar Hijri.

We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us and try to guess the names of the birds singing. Anakin Skywalker: I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough irritating and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything is soft and smooth. This shows Padme is about love, and the present, which results in remembering good times. Anakin focuses on the negative/hate, and his troubled past. So, it might not be as clever as “I love you” - “I know” but I don’t think it is bad writing.

A few of them (all of whom are looked upon by many of us who know them, as being ‘extreme’ or ‘far right’ in some fashion) support all 4 of these ideas with varying levels of enthusiasm. Of the others some would like easier access to guns because shooting used to be a big hobby in the UK and there are people who miss it but every one of them would support very severe limitations on gun ownership while still making guns more accessible within the UKsome of them believe there should be far more legislation to restrict abortion but none of them would consider ending itthe vast majority of them simply don’t appear to care enough about gay marriage to have any real opinion on it but do feel that the equality aspect of it makes it something worthwhile for society as a whole though of course there are a minority who consider it to be a herald of the end of civilisation and something which will destory the familysome of them do think the death penalty should be brought back for various offences although their opinions on this vary greatly (with the only unifying thought seeming to be that paedophiles should always be executed) and some of them are vehemently opposed to it I think what this probably highlights is that although British Conservatives might be united in an overall vision of how they want the country to be, there’s a much wider range of opinions and beliefs than is found among American Conservatives."},{"prompt":"w can we use chat GPT in the best possible way?","completion":"Keep in mind that Chat GPT is a machine learning model and not a human being.

If Europeans believe we do, I suspect that movies are a big part of the reason. American movies about WW2 naturally focus on Americans. Hollywood has never showed much interest in Kursk or El Alamein. And since American movies are seen around the world, Englishmen or Russians may see them and snarl “Where are WE?

But let’s not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it’s easier to find and read. Let’s rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield.

He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna’s advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna’s son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra’s son destroyed six of Karna’s advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots.

Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana’s chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima’s vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna’s prowess that Satyaki couldn’t defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha’s boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can’t recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma’s exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess’ Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I’ll provide information about all his victories. Don’t worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else’s chariot. The word ‘vanquished’ is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima’s arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‘retreat’. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‘devoured’ by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2–3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima’s defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima’s life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn’t defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha’s demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna’s Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama’s destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5–6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9–10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don’t downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna’s celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona’s son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna’s arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona’s son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna’s valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna’s four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times. He just overpowered him on 1 Instance. Whereas, Arjuna overpowered Karna most of the time in that battle.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: #FvvjG] I have tried to answer your question in the best way I could. My appeal to all those who read the answer is to accept the facts as it is and comment and tell me if I have given wrong information. Please don’t downvote and report to collapse this one. I have consumed 2 hours everyday from last 3–4 days for writing this answer. To answer your question in short, Arjuna was the most powerful warrior except Shri Krishna and Shri Balarama Ji.

The ship is an artifact, created to serve a certain purpose. But as a contingent aggregate of physical things it could be the “same” while losing its ability to play that role. We take the ship apart and now it’s a pile of lumber. Suppose the sailors do this to have fire when shipwrecked on an island. The pile of parts is “the same” as the ship in the sense it’s the same physical aggregate, the same physical components. But if we regard it as “the same” while the parts are gradually replaced over time, that tells us a different principle of identity is at play. Presumably one that requires the ability to still serve the role as the original, that is, as a ship. But what if the parts were taken out and used in other ships for some years and then by accident re-assembled into a ship with the same parts in a shipyard years later. Would it be the same ship or a simulation? If we would say it’s not the same ship, this suggests we’re using a criterion where causal continuity is at play. To be the same ship then requires continuous existence of a ship aggregate that has continuity as a ship despite replacement of parts. But it’s still a contingent aggregate, a mere pile of things, that happens to serve a certain function. This is not the same as human identity over time because humans are an organic unity in a way that a ship is not. Humans continually take on new matter through eating and breathing and give off matter through wastes. But a living thing has a certain homeostatic character, functions that work to keep it alive. A human has a nature as a single thing whereas the ship has no nature though its physical components do. The wood in the ship has its physical structure as do the metal parts. But the ship as such has no nature. So human identity over time requires a thing with the same nature that has causal continuity over time. To the extent we think the ship of Theseus requires some continuity as a ship over time to be the same ship, we seem to be using an analogy with living things.

Rapid weight loss methods, such as extreme diets or excessive exercise, can often be detrimental to your overall health and lead to a cycle of yo-yo dieting. Instead, focus on making gradual, long-term changes to your lifestyle that will not only help you shed those extra pounds but also maintain your weight in the future. Here are some effective and safe strategies to help you lose weight in a reasonable time frame: Balanced Diet: Rather than severely restricting your calorie intake, aim for a well-balanced diet that includes lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Portion control is key – focus on eating smaller, nutrient-dense meals that keep you satisfied and provide sustained energy. Hydration: Staying properly hydrated is crucial for weight loss. Drinking water before meals can help control your appetite and prevent overeating. Replace sugary beverages with water, herbal teas, or infused water to cut down on unnecessary calories. Regular Exercise: Incorporate a mix of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, or cycling) and strength training into your routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days. Mindful Eating: Pay attention to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly and savor your meals, which can prevent overeating. Avoid distractions like screens while eating to stay mindful of your food choices. Sleep: Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep deprivation can disrupt hormones related to hunger and appetite, leading to weight gain. A well-rested body is more likely to make healthier food choices and engage in physical activity. Stress Management: Chronic stress can lead to overeating or making poor food choices. Incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy.Consult Professionals: Before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or registered dietitian. They can help create a personalized plan that takes your individual health status and goals into account. Remember, sustainable weight loss is not just about shedding pounds quickly but about developing healthier habits that can be maintained over time. Rapid weight loss methods often lead to muscle loss, nutritional deficiencies, and a higher likelihood of regaining the lost weight. Focus on making gradual changes that promote your overall well-being, and be patient with the process. By embracing a balanced lifestyle, you can achieve your weight loss goals and enjoy improved health in the long run.

Before 1958, the Republic of China(1912 - 1949) was an Agrarian Society. Four out of five Chinese worked in agriculture. But this changed as property rights in the countryside were kept on hold which eventually led to the growth of small nonagricultural businesses in rural areas. It all changed when this guy Mao Zedong, took over as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China(CPC) and founded the People's Republic of China (PRC)(1949 - present). In the year of 1958, Mao started his Second Five Year Plan which was called as the Great Leap Forward whose main objective was the rapid development of China's agricultural and industrial sectors. This led to massive industrialization throughout the country. Since China is a Communist country, it made a ban on private holdings of farmland and started the agricultural collectivization, where the private farms would run as a joint enterprise and all the food produced would be bought by the government so that it can feed the people working in the industries. Communes were setup where everything was shared. Private kitchens became redundant, and everything in the private kitchen, such as tables, chairs, cooking utensils and pans were all contributed to the communes kitchen. Private cooking was banned and replaced by communal dining. Mao also started another campaign which was called as the Four Pests Campaign(1958) in which rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows were to be eliminated. Suddenly, all the hell broke loose when the local commune officials noticed that the stockpiles of food was being consumed rapidly by the people of commune which led the food to get depleted. Higher officials did not dare to report the economic disaster caused by these policies, and national officials, blaming bad weather for the decline in food output. But instead, Mao exaggerated the claims of having “super abundance” of food which really didn’t exist. Due to the Four Pests Campaign, a severe ecological imbalance was created due to which several other pests such as locusts, grasshoppers ,etc. have started to spawn which destroyed the crops. Adding to this, droughts and floods was another blow to the peasants in China. This created a detrimental effect on country side where poor people were starved to death and there were also reported cases of cannibalism. And this led to The Great Chinese Famine, Between 1959 and 1961, the famine took a death toll of over ten million which was then reported as the deadliest famine and the greatest man-made disasters in human history.The failure of the Great Leap Forward as well as the famine led Mao Zedong to withdraw from active decision making and turn many future responsibilities over to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Deng Xiaoping Eventually, Deng Xiaoping became the next leader of China and launched the historic Reforms and Opening up program which fundamentally changed the agricultural and industrial system in China. Deng's first reforms began in agriculture. By the late 1970s, food supplies and production had become so deficient that government officials were warning that China was about to repeat the \\"disaster of 1959\\". Deng responded by decollectivizing agriculture and emphasizing the household-responsibility system, which divided the land of the People's communes into private plots. During this period, few of the small scale farmers started to consume wildlife animals for their survival. This was backed up by the Chinese government which eventually led to the birth of wildlife farming industry. The wild animals were traded to the consumers in the Wet Markets which also comprised of other illegal wild animals. Hence it became the Pandora’s Box for new diseases. In 2002, the SARS was originated from a Civet Cat which was sold as a delicacy in Foshan, Guangdong province. Now, it's SARS-CoV-2 a.k.a COVID-19 which was originated in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Wuhan. And the rest is history."},{"prompt":"Do you know of a good scifi novel with an uploaded human mind or an AI as a main character?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Hugh Weller-Lewis] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Hugh-Weller-Lewis-1] has already mentioned Iain M Banks’s Culture novels, but they bear mentioning again. The Culture’s Minds, hyperintelligent AIs who to all intents and purposes run a galactic civilisation, are in the background in the first few novels, but are increasingly front and centre as the series progresses. Excession, Look To Windward and Surface Detail are the novels with the AIs most central to the story, but it’s worth reading all the books, starting with Consider Phlebas. A mention here also for Ken Macleod, Banks’s friend and literary executor, whose novels The Star Fraction, The Stone Canal (which are closely related) and The Resurrection Game feature uploaded minds - but to say any more would spoil things. The Night Sessions also features an AI as a major character, an ex-military robot now working for the police with a human partner, who goes by the name of Skulk. Charles Stross looks at post-human ism from several angles. Accelerando explores how we might end up with uploaded consciousnesses; Glasshouse envisages a group of traumatised mercenaries uploading themselves into an experimental therapeutic community; and Saturn’s Children and Neptune’s Brood are literally post-human: the characters are all androids that had been created to serve humanity, but who have outlived our long-extinct species. Uploaded human minds are something of a preoccupation for Greg Egan, who has written two novels (and a number of short stories) where uploaded consciousness is front and centre. Zendegi explores how you might go about uploading a consciousness in the first place, Permutation City looks at what it might be like to be part of an uploaded community on an interstellar mission. Short stories such as The Planck Dive are set entirely within uploaded communities, as is his novel Diaspora (for my money his best book). The lead character of Ann Leckie’s Ancillary series goes in the opposite direction: she is a former spaceship AI stuck in a single human body out of the army of “ancillaries” that it used to control."},{"prompt":"Before legalization, what did people think zig zags were used for?","completion":"I grew up believing Zig Zags were chewy peppermint pastilles"},{"prompt":"What does the word 'lingam' mean in Sanskrit?","completion":"Lingam means a symbol or mark.

Should I sit in on his class for a day?","completion":"My younger brother got notes sent home almost everyday for not turning in his work. He'd tell our grandmother (she was one of our caregivers, parents were pretty much out of the picture) that he didn't have any homework. But the next day he'd get another note, she'd ask him if he had any homework, he said no, next day he'd get another note. My grandmother got fed up at his blatant lies, she threatened him if one more note she's going to school to talk to the teacher (my brother was in 7th grade). A couple days later, another note, so she went to the school 10 minutes before school let out, and waited by his classroom door to see his teacher as soon as school was over. He was not a happy camper (icing on the cake, our grandmother dressed like an old lady in the 1990s, when this took place, she had the old lady football helmet hair style and she would draw her eyebrows on in a single line in about half an inch from her actual eyebrows. So as a kid/teen it's extremely embarrassing.) Anyways, she met with the teacher with him in the meeting. My brother apparently got called out on his lies (I didn't get to witness this because I was already in highschool.) And he made some contract that he'd always turn in his homework on time and if he had a question he would ask the teacher. Any who, a couple weeks went by, no notes. Then one day another note. My grandmother said no more warnings. She had asked the teacher if she could come and sit in on class to see what's going on if he gets more notes/not turn in homework. So that next day, she took the note and my brother to school, brought a lawn chair and her crochet supplies and a bagged lunch. She went to the classroom, sat up her chair and supplies in the back of the classroom. She stayed there all day. She found out that my brother would sit in class and stare at his teacher during lessons. Come to find out, my brother had a crush on his very nice looking teacher (she was very pretty, model pretty). So he honestly didn't even remember getting assigned homework, he couldn't admit that without admitting the crush. My brother never got a note sent home again for the rest of his school career. His grades went from D's and F's to C's and a few B's. I can still remember how I felt as a kid/teen, if my grandmother would have come sit in on my class, it might had lead to death by embarrassment. I would have done anything for it to never happen again. Luckily I never got a note sent home, thank goodness (I was afraid to get in trouble). As a kid/teen I'd say, no don't do that to your kid. But as an adult, clearly what's going on now isn't working, so desperate times call for desperate measures. And if it doesn't work the first time. Next time dress up in the tackiest possible way and show up to sit in…lol. On the other hand, maybe you going to sit in you might see an issue that isn't your son's fault at all. Or maybe he just needs more help than the teacher can't give without taking from the rest of the class and you could hire your son a tutor. Whatever you choose to do, good luck and I hope things improve in school for your son."},{"prompt":"w do I dance the Tango?","completion":"Ah, it is a bit too complicated to describe on Quora, BUT, you can figure out what style you want to learn before going in for lessons.

However, there are several news organizations in the United States that strive to maintain a reputation for impartiality and objective reporting. Here are a few well-regarded sources that are generally considered to be relatively neutral and nonpartisan: Reuters: Known for its commitment to factual reporting and avoiding sensationalism, Reuters is a global news agency that provides coverage on a wide range of topics with a focus on accuracy and impartiality.Associated Press (AP): As a nonprofit news organization, the AP aims to provide unbiased reporting and is widely used as a primary source of news by many media outlets. They follow strict guidelines to ensure objectivity in their reporting.BBC News: Although based in the United Kingdom, the BBC offers comprehensive coverage of global events, including news from the United States. It is known for its rigorous reporting standards and commitment to impartiality.The Wall Street Journal: While some critics argue that The Wall Street Journal has a slight conservative-leaning editorial page, its news reporting is generally regarded as reliable and unbiased, especially in economic and business matters.The New York Times: The New York Times is a reputable newspaper that covers a wide range of topics. While it has faced criticism for potential bias on certain issues, it still maintains a commitment to accurate reporting and includes diverse perspectives in its coverage. It's important to note that even with these sources, it is always recommended to critically evaluate the information presented and cross-reference multiple news outlets to gain a more comprehensive understanding of any given topic. Additionally, biases can still exist within individual articles or specific journalists, so maintaining a media diet that includes multiple perspectives is essential for a well-rounded understanding of the news.

For me I never realized that stretching would really affect my running, I wasn’t a sprinter. For years I had patellar tendinitis (I had been working out and running for over 10 years at that point) and tried everything to get rid of it. I saw doctors, went to sport medicine; I even stopped running for 3 years! When I started running again the patella tendinitis was gone! Problem solved, or so I thought. After about 3 months it came back. I thought it was something that was a fact of life with running for me. One evening I was thinking about the body and over use injuries. I was thinking how working out one muscle group over time causes muscle imbalances which leads to many injuries (it’s why cross training is important). I then was thinking about how my knee is designed and that my quad could be tight which is creating the problem in the tendons in my knee. I started stretching religiously after every single run making sure that I hit all the major muscle groups especially my quads. It took about six months But The patellar tendinitis went away. I started to develop this weird high calf issue and found this stretch that hurt like crazy but as soon as I’d do it the calf issue would subside. It’s been 6 months now and it’s 98% gone. I’m still slightly thought on my right side but I get at it after every run. Please do do not overlook cross training (and stretching) as it will help from developing muscle imbalances. You can run (or lift weights) for years and years and never see any problem/s and one day out of the blue something pops up. It’s super hard to diagnose. Once signs start appearing it can take years to correct and fix the problem and it can suck the joy out of running. lift weights, take other exercise classes, yoga is great. Plus they add some spice to hitting the pavement day after day."},{"prompt":"What are the similarities between the Hindu Brahmin religion and the Abrahamic religions besides the stories of Abram & Sarai and Bramha & Saraswathi? The Jews claim to be descendants of Abram. The Brahmins of India say they came from Bramha.","completion":"Brahmin is a Varna, like Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. And varna is the manner in which each of us seeks divine perfection. For example, the Brahmin seek the divine through knowledge, the kshatriya through leadership as a service, the vaishya through enterpreneurship as a service and the shudra through their individual talents and abilities. There is no “Brahmin religion”. The Jews were Pagan/Hindu, possibly an early Shaiva tradition as Nandi was a Pagan Jewish icon, before they fell away from the dharmic path and went Abrahamic. It is possible they fell away from the dharmic path thousands of years before they went Abrahamic as much of those who migrated out of the Sindhu-Saraswati Asura kingdoms did in having to adapt to very new realities. But this is a subject matter for future research. Brahma on the other hand is an “aspect” of the “ultimate reality” or “truth”, in Hindu philosophy, not a God. There are no Gods in any Hindu tradition. This is much like Vishnu and Shiva are aspects of the “truth”, one that anyone can validate through simple observation and inference. And while Brahma represents the function of creation as well as knowledge, Vishnu represents preservation of dharma (the eternal essence of the universe) and Shiva the maintenance of the cycles of the universe (material cycles, and time). The symbology used in representations should be adequate to inform you the true nature of these aspects. They also represent “dharmic paths”, as elucidated in the shruti, the smriti/puran and the itihasa texts. Therefore Brahmins cannot possibly have descended from Brahma, an entirely abstract philosophical aspect of divine reality. But since Brahmins or intellectuals seek divine perfection through “knowledge”, Brahma is their “ideal of divine or perfect knowledge”, and the Veda represents their “dharmic path” to Brahma Vidya."},{"prompt":"Why do so many students in India study engineering?

Aviation in a war is especially tricky. Flying training by itself for the USAAF for WWII* had about a 5% fatality rate and nations without clear sky, unlimited fuel and a more pressing need to get pilots into combat now must have lost a higher percentage in trainig or the fiirst few mission. Training for surgery was rough but we expect zero% fatalities from residency (aside from a suicide or 2). War and planes are a different world. For definitive or at least the most entertaining answer for your question, albeit far out on the bell curve tail, read Terror in the Starboard Seat by Dave Macintosh. Available in libraries. Libraries are great. Macintosh, a Canadian, volunteered for the RAF and qualified as navigator for Mosquitoes. This book is a memoir of his war. He was paired with an American volunteer pilot from San Fransisco who was indeed a colorful character. *WWI training was much deadlier.

And both buildings DID take the hit, and didn't collapse — not initially. But the engineers overlooked something simple, but also critical. The fire insulation material that protected the steel infrastructure of the buildings was BLOWN OFF, when each plane hit that building. Without that fire insulation material there to protect the steel from the intense heat of all that jet fuel, now there existed a scenario that the engineers did not account for. The fire from thousands of gallons of jet fuel heated and weakened the steel. Not melted the steel, just weakened it. With that weakened steel, the skeleton of each building was no longer able to support the weight of the floors above. Then as each floor collapsed, the stress on each floor below was unable to bear that weight. Think of it like this — we have trucks that can support the weight of a car, right? You see flatbed tow trucks carry cars around your city every day. But what would happen if you DROPPED a car on to a flatbed tow truck from a height of 20+ feet? Would the tow truck take the weight and be undamaged? No, of course not. That's why each floor of each WTC building could not bear the weight. Once one floor in the middle collapsed, each building was doomed to fall. What is the lesson from all of this? That it isn't practical to design buildings THAT TALL, that can withstand a direct hit from a LARGE commercial airplane. Did Osama Bin Laden KNOW all of that, when he planned the whole thing? He didn't have to know. Even if both WTC buildings had remained standing, the desired TERRORIST goal would have been accomplished. The fact that the buildings fell was just a bonus for the TERRORISTS who comitted this horrific attack."},{"prompt":"dry sift kief higher quality than bubble hash?","completion":"All other factors being equal there is no difference. “Bubble hash” must be dried before using.

I’ve been searching for a lot and can't really find anything.","completion":"Let’s be clear about this: Installing and using plugins you haven’t paid for takes money away from the hard working people who make them.

However, here are some general guidelines that may help you: Consider your audience's time zone: If your target audience is mainly located in a specific time zone, consider scheduling your video to upload during their local daytime hours, when they are more likely to be active on Facebook.Avoid uploading during peak hours: Facebook tends to have higher levels of activity during peak hours, which can make it harder for your content to stand out. Avoid uploading your video during these times, such as during the morning or evening rush hour.Test different times: Try uploading your videos at different times of the day or week and track the engagement rates to determine which times work best for your specific audience and content.Consider your content: If your video content is time-sensitive or related to a specific event or holiday, consider uploading it in the days leading up to or during that event for maximum engagement. Overall, it's important to experiment with different upload times and monitor the performance of your videos to determine what works best for your audience and content."},{"prompt":"What do hotels do with used soap?","completion":"I believe they dispose of it."},{"prompt":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","completion":"In our scriptures it is said that what people will say that will become shashtra in kaliyug.

It's possible the phone became slow after you updated the software, Samsung may have slowed the phone down in order to protect the aging battery.. so did you update the phone recently?

But for buying ergonomic chairs there are many brands. After searching many websites i found “FEATHERLITE” chairs which is the best branded company for chairs and furniture's. A few important feature of chairs for studying longer duration are… Height must be adjustable, so that we can sit at convenient height at the table.Leaning tension on back support must be adjustable. Also the height of hand rests must be adjustable.The most important feature of chairs for studying longer duration is “The back support should be straight i.e., the angle between back support and chair should be 90°”. So the chairs which have back support way too back and the chairs like in barber shop should never be used for studying.Also one more important thing to keep in mind when buying table and chair for studying is to ensure that the minimum height of the chair upto handrest should be less than the height of the table studying area. There are many types of chairs in FEATHERLITE, but i brought “Featherlite Contact Project High Back Desk Arm Chair (Black)” which was quite amazing. There are better chairs available in this brand than this one, but those weren't deliverable to my location so i brought this. Initially I thought the back support wasn't sturdy but after watching demo video on YouTube i found it was sturdy and it actually was sturdy. Price might be a little high but rather buying chair's at low prices of cheap quality which are going to eventually get damaged buying this type of best branded company chairs is better.

However, there are several factors that have been identified as potential contributors to unhappiness or dissatisfaction among certain individuals or groups within a generation. Here are a few possible reasons why some people in our generation may feel unhappy: High expectations: Our generation has grown up in a time of rapid technological advancements, societal changes, and increasing globalization. With these changes come higher expectations and pressure to succeed in various aspects of life, such as education, career, and personal achievements. Striving to meet these high expectations can lead to stress and dissatisfaction when goals are not met. Economic challenges: Many individuals in our generation have faced economic challenges, such as student loan debt, limited job opportunities, and rising living costs. These financial pressures can lead to stress, anxiety, and a sense of insecurity about the future, which can contribute to unhappiness. Social media and comparison: Social media has become an integral part of our lives, allowing us to connect with others and share experiences. However, it can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and unhappiness when we constantly compare ourselves to others' carefully curated highlight reels. This constant exposure to others' seemingly perfect lives can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of dissatisfaction with our own lives. Mental health issues: There has been an increasing recognition of mental health issues in recent years, and our generation has been more open about discussing and seeking help for these issues. Factors such as stress, pressure, and societal changes may contribute to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions, which can impact overall happiness and well-being. Disconnect from nature and community: In an increasingly digitized world, our generation may spend more time indoors, isolated from nature and face-to-face social interactions. Lack of connection with nature and a sense of community can lead to feelings of disconnection, loneliness, and unhappiness. It's important to remember that while these factors may contribute to unhappiness for some individuals, they do not apply to everyone in our generation. Each person's experience is unique, and it's essential to consider a range of factors when discussing happiness and well-being. Additionally, societal changes and generational experiences vary across different regions and cultures, so it's important to avoid making overly broad generalizations."},{"prompt":"want to start a diet but I can never go by the diet. I always eat more. How can I keep going along with my diet?","completion":"Most diets are designed to lose weight over the short term and have a focus on weight and not holistic health—as in nutrition and disease prevention/healing through whole plant foods. Consequently, most diets use caloric restriction and just eating less of the food that naturally leads to weight gain. Which will lead your body craving and needing more. Now, a caloric deficit is necessary to lose weight. Yet one can and ideally achieves this through actually eating more! The key to losing weight isn’t eating less, but actually eating MORE of the right foods. vegetarians, especially vegans, have consistently shown to have lower and normal BMI’s compared to omnivores or pescatarians for the main reason that they eat more fruits and vegetables which are naturally low in calories. By eating more fruits and vegetables you can eat more, fill up your stomach, and satisfy your hunger and nutritional needs, while still reaching your weight goals. a clear strategy can give us our best results. But diets often fail because they are meant to. When trying to maintain our weight it is best to approach it from an education and holistic health mindset then trying to punish ourselves just to lose a few pounds at any consequence. This is all of course easier said than done. Knowing that we should do something is NOT that same as understanding why we should do it or how to do it.

I was on a few dates before I finally got married, so I have a bit of experience. Oh, and one of my special interests is body language. Ironic. Everything everyone else has said. But my own 2 cents. Learn body language and get inside her head. If she furrows her brow, leans forward, and crosses her arms under her chest this is a “look at me\\" gesture. You've upset me. Look after me. It is warm, open. She's saying, “you've upset me, I want you to make it up to me.” If you continue to ignore her, she will lean back, raise her chin, cross her arms over her chest. She may even literally look down at you over her nose. This is a closed off gesture. You've seriously offended me and I'm not listening to you or open to you. I have my walls up. You have to get me to take them down. Now the mistake a lot of men make is that they take her too literally or they misunderstand her perspective. Men think, ohbshit, I've fucked up, the date is over. She won't date me. They are completely missing her point. Think about it from her perspective. She's attracted to you physically, sexually, intellectually, and yes, maybe even emotionally. Chemistry is hard to come by. And she may have invested a lot of time and money to get here to this date. And the minute you screw up all you can think about is yourself and think, ok on to the next one. No, a woman who takes this posture is challenging you. She's saying, “change my mind about you.

In 1996, at 41 years of age, I was trying to learn Spanish, but because I was working, there was no time to go to formal classes. A friend of mine introduced me to the music of a Mexican rock group called, “MANÁ ” (translation: “manna” — like the food that was sent down from Heaven). They were easy to listen to AND luckily, the lyrics were included with the audio cassette or CD (no YouTube in those days). MY STEPS TO FLUENCY (THIS TOOK ME LESS THAN TWO YEARS TO DO, even though I was still working full-time): 1. LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, WHILE READING THE LYRICS TO THE SONGS. Their songs are on YouTube, complete with lyrics, but if you still like CD’s, make sure you get the original CD releases, (not the “Greatest Hits of…” – “Grandes Éxitos”, “20 Kilates”, etc.) — because it is more likely that the lyrics will be inside. If they’re not included, you can either look them up on a lyrics site (lyrics = letras, in Spanish), or use YouTube. I recommend listening each CD, one song at a time and several times over, to hear each word and process it, but at this point…DO NOT WORRY THAT YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT ALL OF THE WORDS MEAN! What you’re doing now, is learning “phonics”, or how written words are supposed to sound. Listen to each album, several times through, to familiarize yourself with proper word order, and how each word is pronounced. Pay attention to accentuation and the stress put on the words by the singers (cantantes). 2. NOW, SHUT OFF THE MUSIC — AND WRITE OUT THE LYRICS ON A COLLEGE-RULED PIECE OF PAPER, LEAVING ONE SPACE BETWEEN EACH LINE OF LYRICS. Then, in-between the lines of lyrics, by using on-line dictionaries, WRITE OUT THE LYRICS IN ENGLISH. The idea is to begin to leave English behind, but you’ll need to use it as a crutch, at least for now. 3. LISTEN TO THE SONGS AGAIN, ONLY THIS TIME YOU’LL KNOW WHAT THE SONG IS ABOUT, BECAUSE, NOW, YOU’LL UNDERSTAND THE WORDS AND WHAT EACH SONG IS ABOUT. 4. LASTLY, SING THE SONGS, ALONG WITH THE MUSIC, AND TRY TO COPY THE SINGER’S ACCENT & PRONUNCIATION AS CLOSELY AS YOU CAN. You’ll soon discover that you’re starting to remember the lyrics, word-for-word. Since the person who wrote the lyrics has correctly conjugated the verbs in them, memorizing conjugations is unnecessary — that part has already been done for you – just look up the conjugated verbs in a Spanish dictionary or on the internet, and the infinitive form of the verb and its definition will appear in the entry. (Example: “comió” – preterit: means you/he/she/ or it ate; from “COMER” – infinitive: TO EAT.) 5. AFTER YOU FINISH ONE ALBUM, GO ON TO ANOTHER ONE. YOU’LL QUICKLY NOTICE THAT COMMON KEY PHRASES AND CONSTRUCTIONS, THAT YOU NOW ALREADY KNOW THE MEANINGS OF, HAVE BEEN WRITTEN INTO THE LYRICS OF THE NEW SONGS. 6. AS YOU MOVE FROM ALBUM TO ALBUM, YOUR VOCABULARY WILL START TO GROW. Other groups that I used include: Enrique Iglesias, Lucero, Patricia Manterola, Shakira, Gloria Estefan, Fey, Ricky Martin, Sentidos Opuestos, Ricardo Arjona, Ricardo Montaner, Chayanne, among many others. After your vocabulary has grown somewhat… 7. START WATCHING…A SOAP OPERA — THAT’S RIGHT, A SOAP OPERA (UNA TELENOVELA)! They are cheesy, contrived stories, but IMHO, they are absolutely the best medium to quickly gain an understanding of how things are really said in the Spanish-speaking world. Benefits: There is a story, a scene (like a doctor’s office, for example), professional actors, and clearly-enunciated dialogue. Usually, the actors will speak their “lines”, taking turns while listening for a “cue-word”, so they know when to say their lines. This is unlike in real life, in which people talk over each other, interrupting them. I would follow one SOAP OPERA, from beginning to end – each one lasts 2 months, or so; then a new one is started, unlike U.S. soaps which seemingly continue forever. I suggest recording each episode, later to be replayed — scene-by-scene — WITH SUBTITLES IN SPANISH! This was the gauge by which I measured my progress, by estimating the percentage of words I knew, versus those I still didn’t understand, or couldn’t even make out when spoken. You can also watch movies that have been dubbed into Spanish, along with the subtitles in Spanish, however I discovered that the words don’t always match up as well as they do in the soaps (this would be because different companies do the dubbing and subtitling, I imagine.) 8. I bought a SPANISH-ONLY DICTIONARY FOR CHILDREN off the internet, which was used to “wean” me off of the English-Spanish translating dictionary that I had been using. I STARTED LOOKING UP UNFAMILIAR WORDS, as I watched the soap operas. The dictionary I found, listed each word’s part of speech, whether it was masculine or feminine, listed all of the definitions for them and even had an example of a sentence, in which it was used in proper context. 9. As your vocabulary grows, along with your self-confidence, START SPEAKING IN SPANISH with anyone and everyone you can — to the maximum level of your ability. They never made fun of the way in which I was speaking – in fact, I found all Spanish-speakers to be gracious, understanding and extremely helpful in learning their language. After all, most of them are trying to learn a harder language — ENGLISH! 10. READ BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON, AND PRACTICE WRITING OUT SENTENCES, TOO. PERIODICALS MAKE GREAT STUDY GUIDES, SINCE YOU CAN HIGHLIGHT OR MARK THEM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT. One book that I found to be particularly useful was, “BREAKING OUT OF BEGINNER’S SPANISH”, by Joseph Keenan. It’s not a grammar book, per se, but rather a “how-to-use-it” book. One last piece of advice: ALWAYS LISTEN TO MUSIC OR TV USING HEADPHONES OR EARBUDS, TO CAPTURE ALL OF THE SOUND – TONE, ACCENT, EMPHASIS. I FOUND THAT A LOT OF “SOUND QUALITY” IS LOST WHEN LISTENING TO A SPEAKER, ACROSS A ROOM. For me, this has been an amazing journey — I hope that it will be for you, too!"},{"prompt":"What excites you about the future?","completion":"Here are some of the potential benefits and exciting possibilities that the future of artificial intelligence could bring: AI has the potential to greatly improve efficiency and productivity across a wide range of industries, leading to increased economic growth and improved quality of life.AI can assist humans in solving complex problems and making important decisions, leading to better outcomes in fields such as healthcare, finance, and education.AI can be used to improve the safety and reliability of critical systems, such as transportation and energy production.AI can be used to create new forms of technology and entertainment that were not previously possible.AI can help with the progress on some of the world's most pressing problems such as climate change, by developing new ways to generate clean energy, and analyzing large data sets to understand climate change.AI could be used to develop more intelligent and capable machines, and robots, which could help in areas such as manufacturing and logistics.The advancements in AI could also help in creating more personalized and efficient services and products to consumers.

At that point, we were in a severe recession and the federal government was suffering from reduced tax receipts.

To make matters worse, the economy was so damaged by this tax hike that the federal government didn’t even get the revenue it thought it would get. The Great Depression created the conditions that made Hitler and Japanese aggression possible. It horribly marred domestic politics in the United States and has left us with a huge and unaccountable federal government. The GOP has never recovered from the drubbing it took in the 1932 election and is consciously not representing the people who vote Republican. It made all of the horrors of World War 2 come true and lead to the Cold War. I would veto the 1932 federal tax act and then plan on Herbert Hoover still losing the 1932 election. It just would not have been nearly as bad, and hopefully FDR would have a lot less clout to enact counter-productive legislation and the country would recover from the economic crisis more quickly. I would also want Zachary Taylor to live out his term as U.S. President. Taylor was a unionist and against the Compromise of 1850. He was a very successful general and talked of raising an army and putting down threatened rebellion. He was also a slaveholder. I think he probably would have been successful in putting down a secessionist crisis and thereby avert the Civil War 10 years later had he not died in office in 1850."},{"prompt":"Do you believe in karma?

If you ask most people what karma is all about they will say something like, “Karma is punishment for past wrongs.” Or “What you do to others will come back to you. It’s seen as a sort of cause and effect; a universal system of justice against your crimes. Karma directly or indirectly works for everyone . It will come back in unexpected way . What goes around comes around . Karma is not punishment, it’s not revenge, it’s not justice. Karma is the universe giving you opportunities to alter your vibration.

An outside investor is needed when the entrepreneur cannot fund a development where insufficient capital is available without one. This may be the case to fund a new venture or expansion of an existing one. In my entrepreneurship experienced I used this a number of times. If a new opportunity looks good or expansion is a clear option then this seems quite normal to me. My own entrepreneurial activity has come to an end so I won’t be starting or investing funds in any more businesses. That doesn’t stop me developing and researching ideas. The one thing I have given up is “Taking Financial Risks”. My current research activity is looking a bit more than promising but it does not and will not require capital funding and does not involve any financial risk. So what I am saying is I won’t take any financial risks but this has not stopped me developing ideas!

CAVEAT: You are comparing a Cluster B disorder, NPD…a dramatic, erratic disorder…with a Cluster C disorder, OCPD…an anxious, fearful disorder. Let me break it down visually so it’s clear… NPD=pursuit of admiration from others (as being worthy)OCPD=avoidance of punishment by others (for making a mistake) NOTE: Individuals with NPD are seeking something outside themselves, while individuals with OCPD are avoiding something others might do to them. HINT: Both individuals with NPD and OCPD behavior is related to external forces they try to manipulate in their favor. NPD behavior (and thinking) is driven to acquire the admiration of others, in order to prop up the individual’s delusion of grandiosity (which is a defense mechanism developed in early childhood to protect the child’s mind from the terror of feeling worthless due to the way their primary caregivers treated them). WARNING: The DSM fails to mention Closet/Covert Narcissism and the behaviors that go along with that form of NPD (which appears as quiet, submissive, and slightly aloof), as well as Malignant Narcissism, and the highly sociopathic and psychologically, emotionally, and sexually abusive and sadistic behaviors those individuals engage in. OCPD behavior (and thinking) is driven by fear and anxiety to avoid punishment from others (which are defense mechanisms developed in early childhood to protect the child from being punished by authoritarian parenting that was harsh when mistakes were made and failed to reward almost anything good the child did). THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT REASONS FOR BEHAVING AND THINKING THEY WAY THEY DO, both caused by very poor parenting in early childhood. EXPLANATION: Personality disorders can be thought of as a cluster of character and behavioral traits that are known to be detrimental to the individual with them, as well as harmful (and sometimes abusive) to others, and which are considered to be outside the normative and healthy range. That is an oversimplification, but it may help to think of them in that manner for the purpose of general understanding. There are 10 Personality Disorders. If interested, you can find all 10 here [LINKED_TEXT: Different Types] [URL: http://outofthefog.website/types-of-personality-disorders/]. Before you compare and contrast NPD with OCPD, it might also help you to read about the 100 common behaviors and traits and that all 10 Personality Disorders share. If interested, you can find those 100 common behaviors and traits here [LINKED_TEXT: Top 100 Traits & Behaviors] [URL: http://outofthefog.website/traits/]. Once you have a rudimentary understanding of the 100 common behaviors and traits that ALL 10 personality disorders are known to share, you can then compare and contrast those the DSM recognizes as inherent in NPD [LINKED_TEXT: Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)] [URL: http://outofthefog.website/personality-disorders-1/2015/12/6/narcissistic-personality-disorder-npd] and those the DSM recognizes as inherent in OCPD [LINKED_TEXT: Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)] [URL: http://outofthefog.website/personality-disorders-1/2015/12/6/obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder-ocpd] Now that you have some resources you can use to understand and learn about those two particular personality disorders, as the DSM define thems. you may be able to make a better assessment of the individuals you’re inquiring about. I hope this helps get you started on your own path to learning and discovery.

Should I see a doctor for this or is this normal for fat people?","completion":"Running half a mile after two years of not running is really pretty good…but even though you are young, you should probably start with medium to fast walking until your lungs and heart catch up.. You should go to your doctor for a general physical just to make sure you don’t have any health issues. Your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs and can also advise you about the best way to decrease your weight. If you have had any chest pain or left jaw or left shoulder pain you should stop and go to an ER or call for help.. this is obvious but true. I know you are young so you’re probably just out of shape…temporarily. You say you are fat…if you have a lot of abdominal or chest cavity fat this can interfere with breathing because your lungs might not be able to fully expand and shortness of breath can happen. Excess fat can also be internal…squeezing your lungs and heart making it hard for them to work. Losing some weight by diet and working up to heavier exercise works quickly in younger people…Your muscles are about 50% of your weight so as you exercise your muscles can get bigger and your weight can increase…but with decreased fat your weight will be appropriate for your overall size."},{"prompt":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","completion":"Actually, it wasn’t government so much as the reality of bandits and limited law enforcement that instilled that belief.

I have been made aware of the benefits of asking questions for which you may not have any interest in the answers. This may be a source of many issues both I and others have seen. An issue I am concerned with is the distinction between the value that Q appears to assign to users as opposed to customers. It appears to me that the quantity of the one that you are concerned with is dependent on the quality of the one you take for granted.

In fact, many people find it beneficial for their skin. Aloe vera has soothing, hydrating, and moisturizing properties that can help calm irritated skin, provide hydration, and promote skin healing. When using aloe vera gel on your face overnight, here are a few tips to keep in mind: 1. Choose pure aloe vera gel: Look for aloe vera gel that is pure and free from additives or additional ingredients that may irritate your skin. You can also extract the gel directly from an aloe vera plant if you have one. 2. Patch test: If you are using a new brand or product, it's always a good idea to perform a patch test first. Apply a small amount of aloe vera gel to a small area of your skin, such as the inner forearm, and leave it on overnight. If you don't experience any adverse reactions or irritation, it should be safe to use on your face. 3. Cleanse your face: Before applying aloe vera gel, ensure that your face is clean and free from makeup, dirt, or other skincare products. Gently cleanse your face and pat it dry before applying the gel. 4. Apply a thin layer: A little goes a long way with aloe vera gel. Apply a thin, even layer to your face and gently massage it in until absorbed. Allow it to dry before going to bed. 5. Pillowcase protection: Consider using an old pillowcase or placing a towel over your pillow to protect it from any potential residue or staining from the aloe vera gel. 6. Rinse off in the morning: In the morning, you can rinse your face with water or follow your regular skincare routine. However, if the gel has fully absorbed and does not feel sticky or uncomfortable, you can choose to leave it on. It's important to note that while aloe vera gel is generally well-tolerated, some individuals may have allergies or sensitivities to it. If you experience any irritation, redness, or discomfort after applying aloe vera gel, discontinue use and consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional. Additionally, if you have any specific skin concerns or conditions, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and recommendations."},{"prompt":"Where can I find a loan shark fast?","completion":"I need to find one?

Rather ironically in the Ukrainian War it is the Russian Federation that is suffering from “Salami Tactics”.The slow escalation of what is being supplied to Ukraine and Ukrainian actions means that none of these actions are worthy of a nuclear response. The problem with the Nuclear M.A.D. policy is that it renders nuclear weapons moot in an armed conflict. No-one wants to perform an act that is likely to kill themselves and destroy their own nation. Putin’s Government is intent on capturing territory for practical purposes - using a nuclear weapon on that territory would render that territory worthless, or at least very costly. It also communicates the message that the Russian Federation is weak. However, in a sense, you are right we have been inching closer to a nuclear war. And that is entirely down to Putin’s decision making. Invading another sovereign nation after making many, many guarantees was a huge risk. Indeed under some of the agreements that Russia has made - these could have been used as a casus belli by the United States and United Kingdom. Furthermore allowing Russian state media to broadcast repeated threats that they’re going to use nuclear weapons against other nuclear powers is highly provocative. As I have repeatedly said the invasion of Ukraine is just as baseless (if not more so) than the invasion of Iraq. It is made more irresponsible and problematic however when we consider that the invasion of Ukraine is a direct threat to the national security of countries that have nuclear weapons."},{"prompt":"Why do waitresses ask if Coke is okay instead of Pepsi?

Restaurants that serve butter do so because their customers want it and, usually, because they’re more upscale. I suspect that most people with the money to choose use butter and expect it in restaurants. Secondly, your premise is that margarine is healthier, presumably because it’s lower in saturated fats; but, they’re higher in trans fats, due to the hydrogenation process. According to [LINKED_TEXT: Harvard] [URL: https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good], the risk of heart disease rises by 23% for every 2% of calories from trans fat consumed daily. Based on the nutrition facts spotlighted on Google, when I looked up margarine and butter, margarine has 2.1 grams of trans fat per tablespoon, whereas butter only has .5 grams. Fat isn’t inherently bad for us. Animal-based saturated fats aren’t great; but, biologically-speaking, we’re animals. We need some amount of saturated fat in our diets and, if a tablespoon of butter, here and there, tips you past your healthy limit, you need to look at your overall diet. I’m going to assume, statistically-speaking, that you still drink milk and/or eat cheese/cheese-based products, ice cream, whipped cream, etc., at least sometimes. Butter is literally 1 step past whipped cream. It’s the cream, taken off the top of fresh milk, and beaten in a blender until the buttermilk separates out and the rest thickens into butter. Then, it can be salted or not and rolled into a log or square mold to set. Edit: There are margarines, like Country Crock, that are healthy in that they are not hydrogenated. However, knowing what brand of margarine the restaurant uses is another matter, and real butter is still healthier b/c it has only 2 ingredients—cream and salt."},{"prompt":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","completion":"This is one of the more legit websites that actually pays you decently for completing surveys etc. online.

Russia is a super power militarily despite its humiliations based on size, capacity and nuclear weapons. It was a political superpower in terms of leading a larger state (USSR) that in turn led a world block and represented an ideology, communism. That is all gone and no individual could restore it. It still is powerful by virtue of its military strength and by being a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN. Russia has never been a superpower in economic terms and is weaker now relatively than it has been in the past. Culturally Russia is a superpower if you consider its cultural influence and achievement. Of course there are so many other countries of that status today or in the past including Ireland, Italy, France, Iran, China, India, Germany, Japan, Greece, Spain, United States… These are all countries with massive cultural achievement and influence on others now or in the past. In terms of knowledge Russia has been a leader and even a super power in a number of areas of science and technology. I am in no position to say if it retains any of that now. Ethical, democratic and moral super powers are harder to define as it really depends on your beliefs as to which country could be a super power in that area. Some countries are recognized for their influence on ethical and moral values above their status otherwise in the world. Many countries are influential in some areas and not others. South Africa is a good example of being a leader in certain areas (like African leadership in LGBT) while being open to criticism in others. Richer countries also find it easier to occupy what appears to be the high ground despite the fact that exploitation is what got them there. It is preferable to consider individuals leaders in this area rather than countries for this reason."},{"prompt":"What are the best ways to invest money?","completion":"The best ways to invest money depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and individual circumstances. Here are several investment options to consider: [LINKED_TEXT: 100% Buy-Sell Arrow Indicator | 100% Non Repaint Indicator V12.0 - MT4 IndicatorsThe Arrow Buy Sell Indicator is a simple MT4 indicator that tells about the direction of the trend.

Stocks represent ownership in companies, and their value can increase over time as the company grows and profits. 2. **Bonds:** Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. They pay interest over a fixed period and return the principal amount at maturity. Bonds are generally considered lower-risk investments compared to stocks. 3. **Mutual Funds:** Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They are managed by professionals and offer diversification for investors with varying risk profiles. 4. **Real Estate:** Real estate investments can include purchasing property, real estate investment trusts (REITs), or real estate crowdfunding platforms. Real estate can provide rental income and the potential for property value appreciation. 5. **Retirement Accounts:** Contributing to retirement accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA offers tax advantages and helps you build wealth for your retirement years. 6. **Index Funds:** Index funds are a type of mutual fund or ETF that aims to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. They offer diversification and typically have lower fees compared to actively managed funds. 7. **Dividend Stocks:** Investing in dividend-paying stocks can provide a source of regular income. Dividends are typically paid out by established and financially stable companies. 8. **Peer-to-Peer Lending:** Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow you to lend money to individuals or small businesses in exchange for interest payments. This can provide an alternative income stream. 9. **Cryptocurrencies:** Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer the potential for high returns but also come with higher risk due to volatility and regulatory uncertainties. 10. **Education:** Investing in yourself through education, certifications, or skill-building can lead to increased earning potential and career opportunities. 11. **Start a Business:** Entrepreneurship can be a way to invest your money and time into building a business that could generate profits and value in the long term. 12. **Precious Metals:** Investments in precious metals like gold and silver can act as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. When considering investment options, it's important to: - **Set Clear Goals:** Define your investment objectives, whether they are long-term growth, generating income, or capital preservation. - **Diversify:** Spreading your investments across different asset classes helps manage risk. - **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Consider how comfortable you are with potential fluctuations in your investments' value. - **Educate Yourself:** Understand the investment options available and how they work. - **Seek Professional Advice:** Consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. Remember that all investments carry some level of risk, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Tailor your investment choices to your unique financial situation and long-term aspirations."},{"prompt":"w do I check if I can charge my phone wirelessly?","completion":"A2A: Do a search on “specifications for [brand and model of phone]”."},{"prompt":"w much did Indigo and SpiceJet benefit both in financial and nonfinancial aspects due to the grounding of Jet Airways?","completion":"The round trip cost from pune to bhubaneswar which was used to be around 6500 rupees in jet era, is now at nearly 7500–8000 rupees.

The first thing you might notice is that many of them keep their socials locked up and private. Many of them also have fewer friends and followers than average. The reason for this is because they routinely hurt and discard their significant others and leave a line of angry exes in their wake. They don’t want to risk these former lovers revealing them and posting telling recollections of their relationship and all of the awful things the narcissist has said and done, so they are very careful about who they allow access. It is all about maintaining their image and reputation. So if you find yourself blocked or outside of their socials, it is because the narcissist is trying to keep you quiet. They also disassociate and detach very easily, so by blocking/unfriending/removing you from their socials, they are essentially demoting you and sending you a message that they have detached. If that sounds like something an angry teenager would do, you are spot on. The narcissist will use social media to spy (Hoover) on your accounts if you leave them unblocked. I highly recommend you block them for your own sanity and safety, by the way, but if you do NOT block them, here is what they will do…The narcissist will watch you like a cat watches a squirrel through a window. They see you as their prey and track your every movement - they pay attention to your geotags so they know where to show up with their new SO to make you jealous. They gauge your emotions by the content you post - sad songs, “vaguebook” secret messages just for them, testimonials of your heartbreak, images of you - how you look, happy/sad/dejected, and most importantly, who you are with. They do this to see how vulnerable you are and how much real estate the narcissist is taking up in your mind. The sadder your posts, the more superior and smug the narcissist will feel. He doesn’t give a care in the world how much he has hurt you - the more you suffer, the more important he feels. Now that you know this, it’s time to clean up your socials, and please for the love of god, block this scum already if you haven’t!! But keep in mind that some of them will use fake “spy” accounts, so always be careful how much info and what you put on there. Lastly, the narcissist loves to play social media cat and mouse with you. They will block and unblock “randomly” to check in on you and see if you are still broken and miserable without them. But they also do it to emotionally torture you, as if you say, “I’m still here but you can’t have me, nah nah nah nah nah”, again, acting like an immature child. They also do this to bait you into contacting them first so they can either slither back into your life temporarily to get something from you (supply: sex, money, attention, etc.) or so they can torment and reject you. This form of narcissistic behavior is so common that I am surprised that more people aren’t talking about it. They want to manipulate you into thinking they are still around but out of reach, that they still care for you but for whatever reason they won’t engage with you, they may also want to use you to triangulate their new squeeze to drive her nuts and pin her against you for their own satisfaction. The worst thing you can do is engage with them on social media after he has unblocked and set the trap. By reaching out to him, you give him ALL of the power and satisfaction. He WANTS to matter - he wants to feel wanted - and he wants nothing more than to make you feel rejected, unwanted, miserable, and inferior. Do NOT lower yourself to him and give into his childish manipulations. The best thing you can possibly do is BLOCK him on everything imaginable and grant him absolutely ZERO access to you. This serves to protect you physically and mentally as they will surely use anything and everything against you to make you look as bad as possible so he can smear you and use screenshots to show everyone how crazy YOU are. Not only should you block them, but you should also tighten up your image in case he does use a bogus persona to spy on you. Use your hottest, happiest, most attractive profile picture you’ve got. Make your cover photo a panorama of an outing with your friends, with a big ass carefree smile on your face. Show that piece of garbage that not only are you living your best life WITHOUT him, but you are also not waiting on the sidelines for his attention or return. Show him exactly what he has lost and what you have gained by putting your best foot forward and removing him from your (cyber) life."},{"prompt":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","completion":"This kind of disinformation is spread by communists .

The first benchmark test scores from a production iPhone 11 Pro were just discovered online, and they absolutely obliterate every single Android flagship phone on the market. Of all the things we’ve learned about Apple’s next-generation iPhones over the past few days, this might actually be the least surprising. Apple’s iPhones get new A-series chipsets each year that offer significant performance gains, and the same can be said of the A13 Bionic chip that powers 2019’s iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Since there are no Android smartphones on the market right now that are even as powerful as Apple’s year-old iPhone XS, it certainly stands to reason that the new iPhone 11 Pro would outscore top Android flagships as well. Assumptions are one thing, but seeing actual benchmark scores is another. Now that iPhone 11-series review units are in the hands of early reviews from newspapers and blogs, benchmark test scores are beginning to pop up. Geenbench remains the best test by which all-around smartphone performance is measured, and it just so happens that a [LINKED_TEXT: Geekbench 4 score hit Geekbench’s website] [URL: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/14601046] on Thursday morning. How did the new A13 Bionic-powered iPhone 11 Pro do? See for yourself: Last year’s iPhone XR achieved single-core scores in the 4700-4800 range, and the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max topped 5,000. As for multi-core scores, all three models reached the mid-11000s. This year’s iPhone 11 Pro shows modest gains with its single-core score of 5472, but the multi-core score of 13769 is off the charts. To put all this in perspective as it compares to the most powerful Android flagship phones out there right now, [LINKED_TEXT: the best Samsung’s brand new Galaxy Note 10+ can manage] [URL: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/14601294] in the same Geekbench test is a single-core score of 3404 and a multi-core score of 10777. In other words, it’s not even close. No Android smartphone in 2019 will even come close to matching the new iPhone 11 series, and that should be fairly obvious at this point. What’s more, next year’s new Android flagships that are powered by next-generation processors from Qualcomm and Samsung likely still won’t approach the kind of performance we’re seeing from the new iPhone 11 Pro and its A13 Bionic chipset."},{"prompt":"Do all entrepreneurs need an outside investor?","completion":"No. Many companies can fund themselves from ongoing revenue along with an amount from the founder(s).

This is not the main argument here. The point is that the PM is entitled to the freedom of practicing his religion and is not answerable to anyone regarding this. A secular country is one which is not biased towards any religion. I believe that any Indian including the PM cannot be expected to refrain from practicing his/her religion in a peaceful manner. And what makes you think that the PM is celebrating certain festivals at the expense of taxpayers’ money ? Every government servant lives on the taxpayers’ expense. You cannot question every person’s day to day activities which include the celebration of festivals. The secular pillars of our nation shake when we daringly reserve seats on the basis of caste. We should question secularism when elections beacome nothing but caste calculus. And the worst part is that these are not yet alarming issues that we talk about maybe because half of the population is benefiting from these. We instead choose to question the PM’s statement of being a proud Hindu or rejecting a muslim skull-cap and now on his celebrating Diwali.

That employee is actually watching out for your company’s best interests. Question: How would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman? Note the emphasis in the question. I would ask the employee if they will not do so because of what he was taught in his religion, or if he is concerned about potential unfounded accusations due to the #metoo movement. If the answer to either question is yes, I would realize that there might be an issue of “Freedom of Religion” or “Freedom of Suspicion” at work here. Since the #metoo movement might be an easier solution, I’ll mention it first: #ME TOO? Yes, it is unfortunate that there are accusations being made regarding inappropriate male-female contact. You might want to make it a company policy that there will be no two-people meetings, male-male, female-female, or male-female in any location with the doors closed; or any two-person meal meetings. It’s so easy to be sure you have a witness for anything that might be accused. It might even be worth asking the participants to keep audio-recordings of those meetings (with permission of all participants) to be sent to Human Resources for archival. Freedom of Religion? I would see if reasonable accommodations could be made. For example, would the employee meet with a female peer when another man and another woman were present at that meeting? He and the woman could do all of the important communication, but the others would keep things on the up and up. If the employee refuses that accommodation, I would ask for a meeting with his pastor, the pastor’s wife, you, the employee, the employee’s wife, and the director of Human Resources to see if the group can make an accommodation that the pastor and the pastor’s wife. If the employee refuses to allow such a meeting to take place, I would assume that the real reason for his refusal is a non-desire to actually do his own work, and I’d suggest that since he has provided no evidence for his religious objections to doing his work that he either do the work or resign."},{"prompt":"it okay as a beginner guitar player to skip chord F?","completion":"That depends on your definition of both “beginner” and “skip”.

The party has faced a string of defeats in elections. There was a brief interlude in December 2018 — when the party triumphed in three state elections – Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. In the 2019 LS elections, the Congress could improve its tally of 2014 by only 8 seats and failed to secure the leader of opposition slot in the Lok Sabha yet again. The end of 2019 was not bad electorally, though it is the allies of the grand old party which actually deserve credit.

Its past and future form is the same ‘taught’. To use teach in the future tense you will require the help of an auxiliary verb of the future tense. We all know in order to indicate something in future we use will and shall according to the subject. Let us look at some of the examples of the verb ‘teach’ in the future tense. Simple Future - I shall teach you mathematics. Here you can notice that the verb teach is in the present form and the auxiliary verb will help us to convey our message in the future tense. 2. Future continuous - You will be teaching me how to play basketball by the time I lose my interest in it. 3. Future Perfect - By the end of this week, the professor will have taught us the entire course. Likewise, you can see in the above two tenses that I have used will in conjugation with the subject ( you ) to show the usage of the verb teach in the future tense. With perfect tenses in whichever tense you want to write with, we always the past participle form of verb. The past participle form of teach is taught. I hope it helps."},{"prompt":"Why are there still statues of confederate generals in the US? Weren’t they supposed to be taken down after the war?","completion":"Statues regardless of type are placed so that people can remember and reflect on history.

Do they just deny the facts?","completion":"There are at least 150 studies that show gun control does not work. It depends on what statistics you use. People pick and chose what they think is important- and particularly leave out those that do not agree with their view point. One thing is certain. We have had a war on drugs for over 100 years, and have made little inroads into stopping the drug trade. Banning guns will NOT stop gun ownership either, particularly among criminals, who use them as tools of the trade. So in the end, gun control can only be partly successful at best… and might be worse."},{"prompt":"there a party similar to Indian National Congress in Pakistan?

But we still have issues with things being too damned shiny and clean, object clipping, and so forth. Clipping will eventually be eliminated through cleaner programming. But one issue that has pretty much always persisted and actually gotten worse is the shininess. Everything looks too pretty. However, in real life, it seems like shiny is the perpetual goal. Shinier jewelry, cars, girlfriends, etc. I don’t seem so dumb now, huh? (Shhhhh!) Real life will soon reach a level of ludicrousness that will have a single benefit: it will make our video games look more realistic (well, more like real life).

Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether are a few examples of “foreign currencies” that work in a very specific context within certain online communities. Exchanging any type of currency is built upon shared trust. We value dollars and Euros because we know that we can purchase goods or services with them.

Let elements of festivals stay as they are. Yes, pollution level has increased, but there is a lot that can be done by educated citizens of the country around the year, than protesting crackers on Diwali. For one, would the educated elite agree on avoiding AC use at least once a week, during peak summers?? Would this section also agree on using public transport options for commute at least twice a week? Would the Bollywood superstars, so trendily supporting no crackers, agree to donate 1% of Diwali box office sales from their movies towards an environment fund?

However, we get angry when people comes to live here and refuses to learn Catalan/Basque and starts complaining about us being rude and about our culture. That said, as a tourist you can speak in whatever language you want, altough, if they know your language, if you use Spanish they will likely prefer to reply in your own language that in Spanish. A French guy asked my something in Spanish and I replied to him in French. He seemed surprised but at the same time amused. Also, the opinion that we may have about you depends a lot of how you behave, if you ask us something in Spanish politely or you tell us politely that you don't speak Catalan and that if we could speak in Spanish with you, we'll be all fine with you.

They will go with the flow if they are comfortable but will not follow if they are not. They have one or two close friends and are not very comfortable in crowds. They are introverted but do attract people to themselves. If a person is pretending to be an INFJ their actions will contradict any of these attributes. The key to spotting any person pretending to be something they aren’t is to see if actions match or sync with what they are saying especially with INFJs . They are usually pretty honest and have a tough time lying. They do have secrets like anyone else but try to avoid talking about them. hope this helps you."},{"prompt":"it worth buying a (new) Herman Miller Aeron chair?

It has a range of adjustable features and a design that provides great support, which can help you avoid back pain and other problems that can come with sitting for long periods. Whether or not it's worth buying a new Aeron chair really depends on what you need and how much you're willing to spend. They're generally pretty expensive, with prices ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 depending on which model and features you choose. However, if you're someone who spends a lot of time sitting at a desk and you want a chair that's going to give you long-term comfort and support, the Aeron might be a good choice. Of course, there are other ergonomic chairs out there that are cheaper than the Aeron. Some good options to consider include the Steelcase Leap, which is usually a bit cheaper than the Aeron, and the Humanscale Diffrient World and HON Exposure, which are both more affordable options. Ultimately, the best chair for your home office is going to depend on what you need, what you like, and how much you want to spend.

NYC is PHAT but San Diego is reasonable as far as SoCal living IMHO. The thing that resonates in my head is that every single city I’ve lived in a had rent bills and no matter how expensive or cheap a place was I would always have the same level of living. Like not any broker not any richer. It all became just a number. Sure when someone points out how much property was and I give a short gasp but remembering shitty places I’ve moved to and trip out.

When it comes to friendship, every single person on this earth would have a different meaning that they believe in. But we may all agree that friendship comes with experience. By that I mean we’ve had childhood friends, high school friends and work friends, and they do come and go. The previous friends you had in you life does impact the friend circle you have today because of that personal gain you received. The friends you choose to have later on in the future will still affect your life as you move on. But what doesn’t change is the fact that you still decide to have friends.

You’ll see PHP doing things like generating interactive content, collecting form data, sending information to visitors, and authenticating users. It’s also the backbone of WordPress and its plugins, which add all sorts of unique functions to the CMS. You can do pretty much anything with PHP. “— [LINKED_TEXT: How to Upload Image by Drag and Drop Using Dropzone JS in Laravel 9] [URL: https://laramatic.com/how-to-upload-image-by-drag-and-drop-using-dropzone-js-in-laravel-9/] It’s also generally very easy to master and a good starter language for new devs. If you do have a background in programming, you should tear right through it. But even total beginners won’t struggle too much navigating the ins and outs of PHP. And if you’re diving into WordPress development, PHP is a must. It’s required to modify WordPress or write themes and plugins, and it’s the core of the whole CMS. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also languages to look into, but none are as integral to WordPress as PHP."},{"prompt":"Can a Jew become a nonJew?","completion":"Being a Jew is a social construct, i.e. the community considers you a Jew, it is not in your “essence”, similar to the US citizenship - the country considers you a citizen. On a personal level, you can always not identify with any of the social identities, but on the social level it is up to the community, so, for example, if you were a secular or a reform convert Jew, you will not be recognized by the Orthodox institutions including the state of Israel. Another example, I was taking care of Jewish Ukrainian refugees in Jerusalem, and here’s a family of a Jewess (certified) with her two kids, whose birth certificates were lost in Ukraine, and who were not recognized as Jews, so they can not become citizens (temporarily I hope). This is how Jews become non-Jews."},{"prompt":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","completion":"Do you enjoy the thrill of getting a new car every 1–3 years? If so, are you willing to pay for the luxury? Leasing a car is typically more expensive than buying a used car and holding onto it for many years. However, not all people want to buy and use old cars until the wheels fall off! If you value the luxury of having a fresh, new car every few years, then leasing is a great idea. It’s the same as if you loved Broadway shows and went to one every month - this is part of your discretionary budget! Doing things you enjoy with your money =) P.S. I’d only suggest spending money on discretionary luxuries like a car lease if you have a savings/retirement plan in place!"},{"prompt":"What are some of the most expensive houses in the world?","completion":"The [LINKED_TEXT: most expensive house] [URL: https://www.quitalks.com/most-expensive-house/] is Buckingham Palace, valued at approximately 2.9 billion.

All news organizations have some level of bias, whether it is conscious or unconscious, and this can be influenced by factors such as the political leanings of the owner, the advertisers, or the target audience. It can be difficult to determine the most neutral, objective, nonpartisan, and unbiased news sources in the US as different people have different opinions on what constitutes \\"neutral\\" and \\"objective.\\" However, here are a few news organizations that are generally considered to have a reputation for fairness and impartiality: Associated Press (AP) - A global news organization that is widely considered to be one of the most impartial sources of news.Reuters - A multinational news organization that strives for accuracy, impartiality, and objectivity in its reporting.BBC News - The US edition of the British Broadcasting Corporation, known for its impartial and balanced reporting.NPR - National Public Radio, a nonprofit news organization that is funded by the public and aims to provide accurate and impartial reporting.The Wall Street Journal - A well-respected news organization that is known for its comprehensive coverage and balanced reporting.

Should I let him?","completion":"I think your kid is a joker. Though you should carry out an investigation before you make a conclusion. Maybe there is a reason why he prefer the floor to his bed. You should know the reason as a parent. Maybe the bed has got bedbugs which are very dangerous at night. The best think you should do is to dismantle his bed and take it to the store. Then you can wait and see if he will be able to ask for it. As a parent, you have the full charge over your kids, let the no control you. You should be the final decision maker in that house. I think your son should provide enough reasons why he likes the floor rather than the bed."},{"prompt":"What is it like to be morbidly obese (BMI > 40)?","completion":"Everything gets bigger. When I was still mobile, I realized just how much things change, even when you gain a little weight. Distances become bigger, literally, because you wont walk that fast, and its mentally exhausting just thinking about it, before you even get up to attempt those distances. All spaces, chairs, tables and any normal social area is either a hard no, if it's even just nearly a little tight; or a yes, but I'll sit on the thing that can support 800 pounds because I'll break your entire dining room set. Cars are a no. Front or backseat, it's just not possible. I'd need a carseat that would be a 4x4 of itself, just one of my legs fills up the ENTIRE space where someone would sit, I mean from head to footrest, seat to dashboard. So when I would have had to have gone places, my parents just rented out a Van. School was.. odd. I was almost 7 feet tall, and needed to gain weight desperately, my heart saw I had no body fat whatsoever, so it beat so much slower, but I still had a lot of, body, for it to pump through so it couldnt figure out why, and instead of just going faster, it started to tear itself apart for unknown reasons. But I gained weight, joined the girls basketball team, and made some friends, but after a few years it became a food addiction, and i became immobile halfway through 9th grade but for that have other answers you can take a look at because I wont go through typing it again, But basically, you get the 6th sense of a hyena, but the mass of an elephant, you get to sniff out awkward social interactions and see spaces and distances you'll get stuck in (which is a story for another day) and cant cross, coupled with the slowness and size (but a lot more strength too because your muscles need to be able to support all that weight so I'd look like a bodybuilder if all the fat was just lifted off of me lol) of an African gray."},{"prompt":"Aishwarya Rai overrated?","completion":"If you talk in terms of beauty that she is then NO!

We really don’t care about money, power, accolades, recognition, fame, or having other people agree with us or even being liked if it comes down to being disingenuous for that purpose. Agree with us too much and we will like you a whole lot less, or at least have no respect for you. I’m not saying we don’t care about people’s feelings, of course if we like you, we most definitely want you to feel good around us. We just see no value in the trappings of success or social recognition as far as society goes, and I’d even take that a step further and say we find it crass, shallow and ultimately empty and worthless, even more so if it’s built on falsehoods and deception. Since coming on here, I’ve come to a conclusion about what purpose we serve in society, and I believe that purpose is to stand outside society and observe and critique it, to generate the ideas which drive progress. To ask the right questions to refine and improve society for the benefit of all residents of this blue ball, which sounds lofty but even micro-improvements on an interpersonal level are better than having a negative impact or none at all. Our inability to be swayed by popular approval and conventional thought and emotion, I think, is an intrinsic part of that function."},{"prompt":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","completion":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children? We had a foster daughter to whom we gave an old Toyota pickup truck (a small one) to get around in. It was the only auto we had to give her at the time, but at 17 it was the first wheels she’d ever had, and she highly prized the independence of being able to drive herself around. She was a pretty good kid (no drugs or alcohol, and she was very selective about the boys she dated), but she tested us from time to time. Since my other two kids were babies, she was the first kid I had to actually ground. But we had a great idea. We didn’t ground her, we ground the truck. She could go anywhere she wanted, but she couldn’t drive the truck. This meant she had to get rides to school and to her friends’ house, or walk. It was sufficient to drive the point home that misbehavior carried consequences, yet it removed the shame from the punishment. In fact, we all used to joke that “the truck’s been bad.”"},{"prompt":"w did Bangladesh manage to overtake India in terms of GDP growth?","completion":"Indias GDP growth before Covid was higher than US or Germany or Japan.

The mystery is part of the art. His pieces have always been about performance and whimsy, if you removed the mystery he would be just another graffiti artist. The quality of his work on a technical level is not actually notable, it’s the mystery, meaning and presentation behind it that has created value. I mean honestly even I can produce work that is identical to Banksy on canvas for a fraction of what his pieces cost. His value is the mystery and the illusion that comes with owning his name.

Some common reasons include fear of being alone, financial dependence, lack of self-esteem, cultural or societal pressure, and fear of retaliation from the abuser. Additionally, some people may not recognize that their relationship is unhealthy or may believe that they can change their partner's behavior. It's also possible that the person may not have the resources, support or information to leave the relationship.

The manual safety thing yet again. This has been addressed so many times you are ignorant beyond description. Or a troll. The manual safety is OBSOLETE and serves only one purpose today. To potentially prevent the gun from firing when you need it the most. People have died because they didn’t turn off the safety when confronting an assailant. Almost every modern firearm design, like the Glock, has passive internal safety mechanisms that prevent the gun from firing unless the trigger is pulled. Even the venerable 1911 added a passive firing pin safety with the Model 80. Added to the grip safety it already had, the manual safety is simply redundant. Today, manual safeties completely unnecessary."},{"prompt":"here ever been a thesis in history that discovered something completely different from what the researcher intended to find?","completion":"Of course.

The short route would be that you just assess your own functionality in social company and basically: if youre charming and enjoy social company for longer periods of time - otherwise ask others to assess that quality about you. Also know that if you ever switched over before, then you can have this dominant trait change depending on whatever period of your life to are in - people change all the time, so your MBTI type doesn't have to stay the same forever."},{"prompt":"What are the causes of most frequent occurrence of landslides in Himalayas than in the Western Ghats?","completion":"Excessive Rainfall loose mud loss of tree cover plateau / slope farming (padkai) roads which haven't formed yet"},{"prompt":"What do you think about President Biden's revocation of the Keystone XL Pipeline permit?","completion":"Finally get independent and Joe shuts it down…what…o ya his son knows some people in the oil business, no problem."},{"prompt":"w can I make skin toner at home?","completion":"Aloe vera brightens your skin and may help fight acne.

The people who do embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC) research define “pluripotent stem cell” as having 3 characteristics: Able to differentiate to phenotypes (cell types) of all 3 dermal layers in culture. This is usually done by simply withdrawing an agent that prevents the cells from differentiatingAble to form teratomas (a type of tumor) when implanted en mass in vivoAble to form a chimeric animal when a few cells are injected into a blastocyst Both ESCS and iPSCs meet all 3 criteria. iPSCs are adult cells turned into ESCs by the transduction of 4 genes into the adult cells: Oct-4 (POU5F1), SOX2, NANOG, and c-myc. ESCs express high levels of Oct-4, SOX2, and NANOG Teratomas have been observed. Fortunately, they are rare, because they are ugly and scary tumors. Look up the images on the web. Most teratomas form in the genital regions, but some are in the mediastinem — which is the center of the chest around the sternum.. That adults can have teratomas iimplies that there are pluripotent stem cells in the adult. However, most of the time they are under growth control and do not form a tumor. There are papers in the literature that describe the isolation and differentiation of stem cells from adults that differentiate into cell types of all 2 dermal lineages. Catharine Verfaillie’s Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are so reported. Urestricted Somatic Stem Cells (USSCs) are also reported to have a similar differentiative ability. USSCs are usually isolated from cord blood or placenta, however. Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells (VSELs) have been isolated from adult bone marrow. They have been reported to differentiate into cell types of all 3 dermal lineages in vitro and, in culture, to form embryoid bodies similar to what ESCs or iPSCs) form. VSELS also express Oct-4, SOX2, and NANOG: [LINKED_TEXT: Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells: Biology and Therapeutic Potential for Heart Repair] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3159118/#%3A~%3Atext%3DVery%20small%20embryonic-like%20stem%20cells%20(VSELs)%20represent%20a%2Cmice%20and%20CD133%20in%20humans.%26text%3DIndeed%2C%20quiescent%20VSELs%20may%20represent%2Cderived%20cells%20in%20adult%20organs]. The paper under my name above describes a stem cell isolated from adult rats that differentiate into cell types of all dermal layers. No stem cell isolated from an adult has ever been shown to form a teratoma. Also, none of the people working with adult stem cells have ever, to my knowledge, attempted to make a chimera with them. Bottom line: ESC and iPSC researchers say there are no pluripotent adult stem cells. Some people who work with adult stem cells are not so sure."},{"prompt":"w was it that Sandy Koufax was not a unanimous selection to the Baseball Hall of Fame?","completion":"Probably because nobody had ever been elected unanimously. And the writers can be pretty funny about it. Curt Schilling is not in the HOF and Jack Morris and Jim Kaat are. I do not know if there are PED allegations against him, but he is not in the HOF. Sandy was mediocre for the first half of his career. In his first six years he was 36–40 record in 691.2 innings with a 100 ERA+ which is average and a WAR of 6.7. In his next six years he was 129–47 in 1632.2 innings with a156 ERA+ and a WAR of 46.4. Over those six years he was the best pitcher in baseball and probably the first great pitcher of the television age and a product of California and the whole thing around it.

He did have a great peak but others, before and since have had better peaks. The best peak ever was by Water Johnson from 1912–16, but that was before 1920. And the reason I start at 1920 is because pitchers could not pitch dead ball innings anymore without going lame in about a year or so There have been 13 Peak WARS of over 40 since 1920 by 12 different pitchers. But lets examine only the ones that happened before Koufax was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Lefty Grove 1929–33 46.0 (though he could have qualified 1928–32 with 44.7) Lefty Grove 1935–39 42.6 Bob Feller 1939–47 42.2 (Feller was occupied helping to save democracy from 1942–45) Hal Newhouser 1944–48 40.9 Robin Roberts 1950–54 42.6 Sandy Koufax 1962–66 40.7 Bob Gibson 1968–72 42.5 Now WAR did not exist in 1972, but won lost records and ERAs did. His ERAs were the lowest, so that helped, but we know that in context his peak was more in line with other pitchers. He had a 111–34 record; only Lefty Grove’s 128–33 was better in 1929–33 and 128–33 if you picked 1928–32. but you cannot overlap peaks. HIs record was cleaner than other guys big peaks like Robin Roberts and Bob Feller. He never lost double digit games during his peak. He led the league in ERA every year, something nobody else has done. But we now know that he only won two ERA+ titles, but that was not considered in 1972. Sandy got 86.9% of the votes; Early Wynn got 76%. But in 1947, 25 year earlier two left handers were elected, Carl Hubbell 87% and Lefty Grove 76.4%. That is how life is. You are dealing with irrationality. Some writers just hated Lefty Grove because he could be a real jerk, and they took it into the voting booth with them. Anybody who saw Grove and Hubbell knew that Grove was better; his record reflects it, but Hubbell was more popular. We do it today with Curt Schilling. I cannot stand his politics and his big mouth, but he is a HOF pitcher. Sandy did not have to put up with that. He got in first ballot and should have, but so should have Lefty Grove and Curt Schilling. [LINKED_TEXT: 1972 Hall of Fame Voting | Baseball-Reference.com1972 Hall of Fame Voting Results.

Outside of any Jewish or Christian ideology is an actual archaeological record and according to that record every inch of planet earth was once submerged under water. DID YOU KNOW…. SEA FOSSILS WERE FOUND AT THE TOP OF MT EVEREST? HOW DID THEY GET THERE? OH I KNOW, Sir Edmond Hillary himself had his Sherpa guides carry them up there where he carefully deposited them. WRONG. DID YOU KNOW THE EARTH WAS AT ONE TIME 1/2 THE SIZE IT IS NOW? Oh yes it was and even further the entire standing water body was at that time enveloped IN THE ATMOSPHERE where it gave superior radiation protection and formed an actual GREENHOUSE which was not only described to have been in the GARDEN OF EDEN of Biblical lore but also the most ancient writing of Buddhists and Hindus. Something happened that PIERCED THAT CANOPY which caused it to rupture in several places which was can identify because just like when you take a 5 gallon bucket of water and pour it onto dirt it eats a huge crater…. this was/is how both the Marianas Trench and the Great Laurethian Abyss was created as well as how the earth was SPLIT and made into a pear shaped body with 60 of its mass being in the southern hemisphere. THAT CRACK ENCIRCLES THE PLANET TO THIS DAY AND IS WHAT FUELS THE JET STREAM. But when the canopy was ruptured it also CAUSED A GREAT VACUUM WHICH ACTED EXACTLY LIKE HOW A GLASS LIGHT BULB IS FORMED AND EXERTION OF THAT OUTWARD PRESSURE SUCKED THE PLANET INTO A BIGGER SIZE WHILE ALSO CREATING MEGA CAVES SYSTEMS THAT ENCIRCLE THE GLOBE. One could actually travel from New York City to Los Angeles COMPLETELY UNDERGROUND VIA THIS CAVERN SYSTEM which is carefully guarded for national security reasons. NOTE: THE OCEANS COVER 2/3 OF THE EARTHS SURFACE NOW. IF THE EARTH WAS 1/2 THE SIZE THEY COULD EASILY COVER THE PLANET AS SUSPENDED IN THE ATMOSPHERE. NOTE: EVERY DAY IN THE CLOUDS THERE IS ENOUGH ACTUAL WATER SUSPENDED IN THE ATMOSPHERE TO FILL THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND THIS IS ONGOING. DURING TYPHOON AND HURRICANE EVENTS THAT AMOUNT OF SUSPENDED WATER MAY EASILY BE EQUAL TO THE INDIAN OCEAN. I know hard core mountain climbers and it is well known among them that SEA FOSSILS ARE FOUND IN HIGHLY REMOTE AND IMPOSSIBLE PLACES LIKE THE SUMMIT OF K2, ANNAPURNA, ETC. Only by the actual archaeological and geological records can the truth be known and this is NOT ACCORDING TO ANY SPECIFIC RELIGIOUS BELIEF BUT ACCORDING TO ANCESTRAL KNOWLEDGE AS A WHOLE AMONG MANKIND. NOTE: THE DINOSAUR KILLER ASTEROID THAT FORMED THE CARIBBEAN SEA IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE EVENT THAT RUPTURED THAT CANOPY WHICH ALSO DUE TO LOSS OF WARMTH AND EXPOSURE TO SPACE FOR THE FIRST TIME CREATED THE ICE AGE. In geological circles these facts are basically accepted and the Christian Bible only serves as 1 AMONG MANY SOURCES THAT TELL OF THIS GLOBAL EVENT. NOTE: EVERY ANCIENT CULTURE IN THE WORLD HAS RECORD OF A GREAT FLOOD THAT COVERED THE ENTIRE WORLD. THE TIME OF THE EVENT AS WELL AS MANY OTHER FACTS ALL COMPARE ALMOST EXACTLY WITH THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT OF NOAH AND HIS FAMILY…. although even the ancient Hindi writings tell of him as well. SO HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT? NOTE: there are over 10,000 actual photos of a giant wooden ship on Mt Ararat Turkey. These were almost all taken during WWII while American and British pilots were flying supplies to China to help them fend off the Japanese aggression. During the 1950′s the USSR Kremlin undertook a massive expedition to that site and found and documented that vessel even to the point to TAKING MEASUREMENTS OF EVERY INCH OF IT. In the late 1960’s there was a massive quake on that mountain where one side of it dropped several thousand feet in one event and that most certainly buried the ark, but remnants of a TAR SATURATED OAK have been brought back and carbon dating places the age almost exactly to the time of the flood event by ancestral records. MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO STOP TRYING TO DISCREDIT CHRISTIANITY AND TO BEGIN TO LOOK AT A MUCH MUCH BIGGER PICTURE IN WHICH ALL OF MANKIND SHARES THE EXACT SAME RECORDS OF THESE PAST EVENTS. THAT IS THE REAL POINT. As far as the BIBLE is concerned, there are many HIGHLY ACCURATE PARTS and many others that have been altered. It makes for a very credible record of many historical places, times, peoples, and events that in some cases have ONLY BEEN VERIFIED TO HAVE BEEN FROM THAT DOCUMENT and the chief of those was/is a place called THE CITY OF UR which was down river from Sodom & Gemoreh but buried beneath the desert sand UNTIL ARCHAEOLOGISTS WANTING TO DISPROVE THE BIBLE UNDERTOOK THEIR WON EXPEDITION TO THAT SITE AND TODAY THE ENTIRE LOST CITY IS RECOVERED. RECORDS ARE RECORDS AND THERE VALUE EXISTS IN THEIR ACTUAL ACCOUNTS OF THINGS WE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE KN WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT. EVERY ANCIENT CULTURE ON EARTH HAS RECORDS OF A GREAT FLOOD EVENT AND THAT INCLUDES YOUR OWN CULTURE BUT ALL ARE INCLUDED. Given the vast distances from CHINA TO MACHU PICHU IN PERU HOW WOULD THAT BE POSSIBLE VIA SHARED INFORMATION? And even more so, how could that have been several thousand years before the concept of CHRISTIANITY EXISTED? Please go study archaeology and actual geological records.

Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures"},{"prompt":"Are Canadian people as polite as they used to be?","completion":"Canadians are polite because on the surface, Canada is such a horrible place to live. Cold weather, unpredictable economic prospects, high costs of living, and an inherently dysfunctional system of national governance means that intrinsically Canada is a dreadful and miserable place to live in. To my American friends who point to their President as indication of the dysfunction of their nation, I’ll point out that the American system of governance has so many checks and balances in place, compared to Canada and most of the world, the US is the most politically stable nation on earth. I contrast the US to Canada largely because comparing ourselves to Americans is a national pastime for Canadians, but there is a general (and I think unfair) sense among Canadians that Americans are rude and impolite. Further contrasting the US to Canada, generally speaking, the US overall is intrinsically better than Canada on the basis of stability, prosperity, and economy. It is my opinion that the general perspective among Canadians about Americans being rude and impolite stems from the observations of the urbanized, cosmopolitan parts of America. The highly populated American regions that are hubs of culture and commerce, but not universally representative of the American experience. Personally, as an Albertan, I love Montana, Idaho, Utah, and to a lesser degree east Washington State - but these “flyover” regions are NOT New York, California, or Texas (at least as portrayed by Hollywood). In reality, most of Canada is like the American flyover states. Canada is not urbanized and even in the parts that are, there are enough sources of inalienable misery that without being connected with your community, you don’t stand a chance. Toronto and Vancouver come close to the exception and while we like to make fun of Torontonians and Vancouverites for either being snobbish, weak or we hate their hockey teams and want American teams to win the Stanley cup instead of theirs - the people are still generally better off than in the American metropolises in terms of embodying Canadian politeness, kindness, and generosity. To understand Canadian character, we can use my hometown, Calgary, to illustrate the Canadian mindset. It is not as cold as the rest of the Canadian prairies but at least half the year it is cold, unpredictable and miserable. Every few years there are total economic meltdowns that are deeply humbling to everyone. Most of the time, those meltdowns are caused by factors completely out of our regional control such as American government policy, Canadian national government policy, provincial government infighting, or global geopolitical events. Growing up in the 80’s, the recession was so bad my Dad walked away from his house after I was born. At the time, he might have sold the house for 1 on the market. He lost his first 5 years of savings after graduating from University as a mechanical engineer - and told me stories how he was “lucky” he could still secure financing for another home for us. It was a very traumatic experience for him. That recession gripped the entire western half of the country for the better part of a decade, and was followed up by similar recessions across the country in the 90’s and 2000’s that, while not as equally severe, was still deeply humbling. A great illustration was how the entire province of Newfoundland had its entire provincial economy collapse in the 1990’s after the Federal government completely mismanaged their cod fishery industry. Half the province ended up unemployed and moving to Alberta to work in the oil industry in what the great Canadian orator, Rex Murphy, dubbed as “The Greatest Canadian rescue operation of modern times.” I grew up in rural Northern Alberta which, in the long winter you could describe as “hell frozen over” and simply “hell” in the summer from the wildfires that tend to destroy entire cities every few years. As an oil patch kid up north, we would tell Newfie jokes and tease the Newfie kids. We didn’t realize back then that there were probably more of those kids from Newfoundland than those of us from Alberta. In hindsight, loving my province and loving our oil industry, I thank God for those Newfie families, because the great oil boom of the 2000’s would not have been possible without them. Regardless, from Cape Race, Newfoundland to Nootka Sound, B.C. and everywhere in between, the Canadian experience was, is, and always will be deeply humbling, sometimes unbearably miserable, and often times from which the only reprieve is in the community you form with your fellow Canadians. In my mind this is the reason Canadians are so polite. Life is hard enough anywhere in Canada. It would be impossible without cooperation and community with the Canadians suffering along with you. Moreover, the communities you form in Canada can often sustain you and get you through those very difficult times. They can even make it so in spite of the misery of being in Canada, it can actually be a wonderful experience being Canadian."},{"prompt":"Can foreigners in US invest in US stock market?","completion":"Yes they can ,living her or any where around the world"},{"prompt":"What is the most dangerous place on Earth?","completion":"The most dangerous single thing on Earth? This. Here’s another view. Still not seeing it? What about this? No? Okay, maybe if I show you this? No, it’s not the Bison, though they can be dangerous if they take a dislike to you. Or the road, though that can also be dangerous if you don’t pay attention while driving (I mean, you could drive right into a Bison, and that wouldn’t be fun for anyone involved). Maybe you need another clue? Yes, hilly terrain and mountain rivers can be a bit dangerous, but surely not all that dangerous, right? I know, it can’t be all that dangerous if there are all those people there, right? What if I tell you that those are all photographs of the same part of the world? Geting a clue yet? Okay, how about something that makes it a bit more obvious? Yeah, you guessed it. Yellowstone National Park, home to Bison, Bears, and a plethora of geysers and hot springs. But Yellowstone National Park also happens to lie on top of one of the largest supervolcanoes known to science. Yellowstone Caldera, the part of the supervolcano lying right on top of the Yellowstone Hot Spot, lies to the north of Yellowstone Lake and measures 43 miles by 28 miles. By comparison, the heavy ashfall zone that surrounded the 1980 Mount St Helens eruption, with ash up to several feet in depth, was around 30 miles by 20, and came from a caldera just a couple of hundred yards in diameter. When (not if) the Yellowstone caldera next erupts, it will make Mount St Helens look like a party popper. Where I live in the UK, I remember cleaning my mum’s car windscreen every morning before school for a month as every morning there would be a small but noticeable film of ash coating it that made it difficult to see out of. When Yellowstone next erupts, the amount of ash in the skies will be orders of magnitude greater Sunlight will be blocked off for days, weeks, perhaps even months, with greatly lowered temperatures for years, and a massive drop in agriculture throughout the entire world. It will be accompanied by an unknown (but presumably huge) volume of toxic fumes which would certainly make life in the immediate surroundings (at least within the >1,000mm zone in the map above, possibly more depending on the prevailing winds) untenable. The death toll from the eruption itself might not be that large (the area is fairly sparsely populated, after all), but the after effects will be a global devastation the likes of which the Human race has never before endured. Despite all that, it won’t be the end of the world, probably not even the end of the United States (though it will certainly be a catastrophe that will forever change the nation). It’s just that the survivors will be living in a world very different from that which existed pre-eruption. That’s the bad news. The good news is that it has been roughly 680,000 years since the last eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera, and although it is due another eruption “soon,” that is in geological terms, and could mean anything from next week to 250,000 years from now, and it is likely that any such eruption will be preceded by months, if not years, of increased seismic activity, so the chances of any of us being around to witness it are pretty slim."},{"prompt":"Why do Barack and Michelle’s daughters smell so bad?","completion":"Geez….soooo immature, lame and sooo you!"},{"prompt":"Are bank tellers allowed to ask why you are withdrawing a lot of cash from your account?","completion":"a teller may ask to ensure the customer is not angry with the Bank/employee before the bank having the opportunity to rectify an issue.

Generally speaking, the call history of a mobile phone number is considered private information that is not publicly available. Some service providers may allow you to view call history through your account management portal, while others may only provide information to authorized parties with a valid court order. In some cases, it may also be possible to retrieve call history data from a phone directly, if you have access to the device. As a language model, I don't have the capability to create a blog but here's a general overview of the topic: The call history of a mobile phone number is a record of all the incoming and outgoing calls made from that phone. This information can include the phone numbers of the calls, the date and time of the calls, and the duration of the calls. Access to this information is typically restricted for privacy reasons, as it can reveal sensitive information about a person's personal and professional relationships. In some cases, service providers may allow you to view your own call history through your account management portal. For example, if you have an account with AT&T, you can log into the AT&T website and view your call history online. Other service providers may provide a similar service, but availability and accessibility may vary depending on the provider. In other cases, access to call history information may only be available to authorized parties with a valid court order. This means that if you want to retrieve the call history of someone else's phone number, you will need to go through the legal process of obtaining a court order. This process can be complicated and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee that you will be able to retrieve the information that you are seeking. In some cases, it may also be possible to retrieve call history data from a phone directly, if you have access to the device. This can be done by backing up the phone's data or using specialized software to extract the information. However, this approach can be technically challenging, and it may also be illegal in some jurisdictions to access someone else's phone without their permission. In conclusion, the call history of a mobile phone number is typically considered private information that is not publicly available. Access to this information may be possible through your service provider or by obtaining a court order, but availability and accessibility will vary depending on the specific circumstances."},{"prompt":"What is ताजमहल किस नदी के किनारे स्थित हैं?","completion":"ताजमहल यमुना नदी किनारे हैं और इसे शाहजहां ने बनाया था"},{"prompt":"Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?","completion":"Holocaust Death camps were labeled a conspiracy theory by Germany, and for a while by everyone else in the world.

However, here are some strategies that might help: 1. Exercise and physical activity: Strengthening the muscles in your back and core can provide support and alleviate pain. Focus on exercises that target the lower back, such as bridges, planks, and gentle stretches. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional or a physical therapist to ensure you're doing the exercises correctly and to get recommendations tailored to your specific condition. 2. Maintain good posture: Poor posture can strain your lower back. Be mindful of your sitting and standing posture, and consider using ergonomic chairs and supportive cushions if needed. When lifting heavy objects, remember to use your legs instead of your back to minimize strain. 3. Apply heat or cold: Applying a heating pad or taking a warm bath can help relax tense muscles and alleviate pain. Cold packs or ice wrapped in a cloth can help reduce inflammation. Experiment with both heat and cold to see which works best for you, and limit the application to about 15-20 minutes at a time. 4. Over-the-counter pain medications: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce pain and inflammation. However, it's important to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications. 5. Improve your sleeping environment: Ensure your mattress provides adequate support for your back. If needed, consider using a mattress topper or a pillow under your knees to maintain a neutral spinal alignment while sleeping. 6 Mind-body techniques: Practices like yoga, tai chi, and meditation can promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve flexibility and strength, which may alleviate lower back pain. 7. Avoid prolonged sitting or standing: If your job or daily activities involve extended periods of sitting or standing, try to take breaks and change your position frequently. Gentle stretching and walking can help prevent stiffness and reduce strain on your lower back."},{"prompt":"Do sunset towns still exist in America where only whites are allowed after dark?

Now here's the thing… The radio advertisement only mentioned the name of the warehouse… and when I called for directions, “this was before GPS”, there was no need for them to really tell me the city. So my wife and I drive there and look around the warehouse… I remember that no one wanted to help us and I remember the startled looks of people when they saw us… But I'm Black…and this wasn't anything that was unfamiliar to me.

He replies… “A Black man, and I've been here since grade school “ So my first instinct was to make a smart ass reply. …but then the events of the day all hit me at once. All I could say is, “really”? He says “yep”… and leans in and says, “personally, I'd suggest leaving before it gets too late, especially since you have your lady friend in the car” Needless to say… I got the fuck out of dodge. I got home and did more research on that area… I wasn't too far from where they stole land from my ancestors and built a golf course on top on it. You can't make shit like this up. Lol. — P.S.

This means that when you are not eating, your body can access stored fat for energy, which helps to keep you feeling satisfied and full.High protein intake: Protein is one of the most satiating macronutrients, meaning that it can help you feel full for longer periods of time. Eating protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, and tofu can help to reduce hunger between meals.Fiber-rich foods: Foods that are high in fiber, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, can also help to keep you feeling full. This is because fiber takes longer to digest, which means it stays in your stomach for longer and slows down the emptying of your stomach.Intermittent fasting: Some people who eat only once or twice a day may also practice intermittent fasting, where they restrict their eating window to a certain period of time each day. This can help to regulate hunger hormones and improve insulin sensitivity, which can make it easier to manage hunger between meals. It's important to note that not everyone can or should eat only once or twice a day.

In All things, moderation. You are way too young to be *worried* about grown up things, but the earlier you mature, the better off you wil be in life. The way that I see that relating to moderation is, begin planning for your future now, by dedicating yourself to getting good grades and having extra-curicular activities. Not only do the activities (and grades) help with higher education (we no longer live in a world where you can expect to succeed without at the very least a 2-3 year “associates” degree, if not more, so don't even think this is optional) but you will find friends that share similar interests, and mentors that will help you with written recommendations for school admissions. Find SOMETHING that interests you, like sports or a musical instrument, and no matter what find at least 1 charity that supports what you support and volunteer, because all other activities are selfish in comparison (sportsmanship is good but you really wouldn't play if you didn't enjoy it and get to hang out with friends, charity, on the other hand, only points outwards). The way to approach this in moderation is by realizing you are young and may think you enjoy something at first, but maybe not after trying it. Don't beat yourself up and find something else if the first thing you try doesn't work for you. Please allow me to digress a moment. When I was younger, younger than you are now, my mother took time out of her schedule and talk me to play keyboard (for some strange reason, she had an organ, like what you would expect to see at an old church), I remember being fairly proficient at it, but I didn't enjoy it and I stopped just as soon as she let me, but thats a mistake I regret even today (I'm almost 50 and just bought an electronic keyboard hoping to relearn). It wasn't until my teens that I was actually forced back in to music, because my step-sister wanted to join our churches youth choir and since she and i were both high school aged, our parents made me go with her, but eventually i started enjoying it and really wish i couod play along while i sing. Try your best to avoid the party scene (yes, thats the sex, drugs and alcohol). But, if you find yourself caught up with friends, first, be sure they don't pressure you in to ANYTHING. I hubg out woth people who did various drugs, sometimes right in front of me, but I only ever consumed alcohol, and once I turned 21, I actually stopped drinking beer, but i will moderately drink hard liquor (that means 1 to 2 an hour, depending on how strong the drink and how i feel while drinking it). If you are female (sorry, i didnt even check your name or pic to see) ALWAYS have someone with you that you trust and look after each other… it is NEVER worth your safety to get so hammered that you black out or at the very least agree to something you later regret! Again, when it comes to friends, id you ever feel pressured in to ANYTHING, ditch them IMMEDIATELY. There is a little secret that most young people don't “get” about “cool” people. The “cool” people are the way they are because they are “doing them” and dont care what other people think about them. So, NEVER waste your effort trying to impress other people, even the opposite sex, (or same if that's the way you lean). Just BE YOU and let those that dont like it go their own way. You will find a group to belong to, even if, like me, it was people who didn't fit into any other group. Heck, I didnt even fit in with nerds :-)"},{"prompt":"Do the British Isles experience hurricanes?","completion":"If you discount the storms caused by the massive amount of pointless hot air created by the Gov’t in Westminster then the answer is “mostly no”. There have been a number of twisters and one damaging severe low pressure system that appeared to get to almost hurricane status (poor old Michael Fish got that forecast a bit wrong). The 1987 storm gave the town of Seven Oaks a temporary new name of “One Oak”. It lifted some roofs, it felled lots of trees, it gave me an unexpected day off work (the UK public transport system doesn’t do well in a crisis). Timing was everything, in mid-October 1987 the deciduous trees are still holding on to their leaves. Next biggy was Doris in Feb 2017.

Here the 'audience' functions as one unit and so singular verb is used. But in the sentence “ the audience have split reaction on the opinions of the speakers “, plural verb form is preferred. The given example , “ The audience was/were “ clapping “ does not transmit the idea that all the members of the involved in clapping and that is also not possible in reality.

Can anyone offer any SEO tips to help improve my SERP ranking on Google?","completion":"I dont know what kind of adult site is yours but here is the guide for for adult e-commerce site and the same should apply same for any adult site. Marketing and driving traffic to an sex toy e-commerce store is not an easy task. If you don't have a brand for yourself then establishing an authority in the industry can be tricky and time consuming. Most people look for trusted adult toy stores while making the purchase because this isn't something which is a normal buy and people who buy it wants to make sure that everything is safe and secured. If you are a brand new sex toy store or having tuff time driving traffic to your adult toy store then follow the below suggestions. I'm sure it will help. SEO SEO should be your number one priority when driving traffic to your website. Target low competition and long tail keywords starting out. If you target high competition and short tail keywords then you wont reach anywhere because there are already well established sites ranking for it and competing with them is near to impossible. Next step in SEO is create a blog page and write articles about sex toys, sex advice or anything that matches your website and products. Getting traffic to your blog is the easiest way to make more sales of your products. Next is create backlinks for your product pages. There are lot of methods of doing this but one of the best and effective method is though guest posting or outreaching to other websites or blogs. In your case you should be looking for adult sites for example adult blogs that writes adult related articles, sex blogs, the blogs that write about sex toys etc. Dont waste time outreaching and sending mails for non adult related blogs as they will barely accept anything related to sex and adult. So your main target sites should be adult content sites. Doing this will help greatly to increase your rankings in the google for your target keywords. Better Rankings = Better Traffic = Better Sales! I would say spend most of your time in SEO and optimising your e-commerce website. Influencers Well, this works great as well. As your are in adult niche, try reaching out for TikTok models and make them to do the thing for your and promote your adult toy. Especally reach out for models like bikini models or may be even OnlyFans models! If you ask me getting in touch with OnlyFans models can do some real magic if the model has loyal following! Obviously, this will cost a bit of money but if the tiktoker has huge fan following then the expose you can get for your adult store can be massive! These 2 i.e SEO and influencers would be my go-to method especially when promoting your e-commerce sex toy store. The other promotional ways to drive traffic can include: Social Media (especially twitter)Comminity engagementAd banners on other sitesPromoting your products with the help of twitter modelsAffiliate partnership with other brands or individual bloggersPR campaignsYouTubers (Would work great. there are lot of YouTubers who talk about sex and stuff. There are even a lot of adult models and OnlyFans models who have youtube channels with good subscribers. So make sure you reach out to them as well.) But if you ask me, branding your site, ranking for your keywords in top 10 results of Google and getting quality links to your site is the best long term strategy for your adult sex toy e-commerce business!! Hope you got some idea and my answer was helpful!"},{"prompt":"Will it be a cake walk for the SP, BSP alliance to win the Uttar Pradesh election?

I used to eat a lot. And I like to have street food quite often. So, talking about street food in Mumbai. These are some of the best street foods.

You can get it easily everywhere on the street. But some of the stores do experiments at it and belive me or not those tastes like heaven. One of my favourite is Mulund's Masala VadaPav. You can search that on my channel — CHAAT SHALA.Misal Pav — I know you must be thinking that why do Mumbaikers have Pav in their food everytime, only Mumbaikers know that.

Even if though Iron Man may not appear again in any movie, there are still many concept designs that are worth taking a look at. Originally a Mark L fan art for Infinity War but it looks like a pretty good design for a different model, which is more offensively advanced. This suit looks like something that Iron Man would’ve created around Mark 70, estimation based on design and weapons. An armour designed for space flights and fights. Sleek, powerful and fast. It’s not nano-tech but it’s a good design that can come into consideration. An antique that can just make an appearance in his home, because you have to have steampunk. A heavy suit consisting of better defense and better offense. Orange, white and black design is a pretty good scheme as it looks like another space designed suit. Nano-tech, space design, slim and fast. Originally a concept for Endgame but it looks more like something in 2024, Mark 75. But alas, Iron Man has passed.

There were very few vaccines available then. Of course, they didn’t call it autism then. In fact when I took childhood development classes in the 1970s, autism was considered a rare thing. We used the now PC incorrect term, “developmentally retarded” for most of the 50 or so very specific conditions that have now been rolled into the blanket of autism. See, insurance covered autism. For the others, you had to fight with them individually to have them covered. Calling them all autism meant that the conditions were all covered. While autism has always existed, it was called by a variety of names before. To people who don’t care to read much, that meant that when they were all rolled together it looked like a statistical jump in autism. During the 60s and 70s, there were a lot of vaccines developed.

It's also worth mentioning that leaving any product on your face overnight can potentially lead to clogged pores or breakouts, especially if you have oily or acne-prone skin.

Efficiency and productivity are two important elements in order for you to become good at what you do. Working in the competitive world of business as a sales representative, you'd have to find the right balance between pursuing a qualified lead until you get that sweet yes to score conversion and knowing when to stop going after a prospect, save losses, and move on to the next target is also key. Sales is one of the most demanding aspects of a business. After finding hundreds of leads, sales teams then have to qualify each one of them who have a high possibility of converting into a paid subscriber. This phase alone takes time and resources and there's no guarantee that all of the leads you have qualified to the best of your ability will actually go through the finish line. With this kind of responsibility upon the shoulders of every sales team, getting the right tools is really important to help take care of a lot of tasks that are part of their roles. One of the really important tools that a sales team should have is a BPM tool that has a built-in integration to help automate and hook it with other tools. Having a [LINKED_TEXT: BPM tool] [URL: https://windowsreport.com/automated-checklist-software/] that will help sales representatives track what part of the processes they run through each day are finished and what still needs doing. I would advise you to choose one that has a Zapier integration that allows you to hook it to other tools to build one system and save a lot of time, stay efficient and productive as much as possible. CRM is another important tool for sales. Although it's main function is to help take care of existing customers, sales is still involved because there is a chance of upselling an existing account. HubSpot is a good choice. Aside from being a trusty CRM, it also contains a comprehensive suite of sales and marketing tools that can help you become efficient and productive.

They lie at the very heart of Britain’s cultural history. An older, lesser-known but quite delightful British legend, however, tells the tale of the pre-Roman Prince Bladud, the father of King Leir, immortalized in Shakespeare’s “The Tragedie of King Lear”. According to legend, poor Bladud son of King Rud, was afflicted with a mysterious skin disease (ostensibly leprosy) while studying in Athens. When he returned to Britain, he was promptly locked up to prevent contagion. At the time, it was common to banish lepers to a life of isolation. Bladud was eventually released and banished. In some versions of the story he escaped but, whichever version you prefer he made his way in the world as a ‘swineherd’. Many of his pigs seemed to suffer from the same ailment he did and, presumably to find relief, they would sometimes wander off and return covered in black mud. To his astonishment, Bladud noticed that the porkers who swanned off to roll about in ‘mud, mud, glorious mud’ were miraculously cured of their affliction. Now remember, this wasn’t in Scandinavia, the Low Countries or Flanders where there were many swamps and bogs, but in Britain. Bladud was probably in modern-day Somerset whose rolling landscape, in Pre-Roman times, was heavily forested with few bogs or mudholes. Bladud decided to follow his pigs the next time they wandered off. They disappeared into a grove of Alders which often grow in wetlands, along stream beds and in marshy areas. The alder was considered sacred by the ancient Britons and imbued with all sorts of magical and medicinal properties. When he found a strange-smelling ooze of black mire, he decided to try it himself. He climbed in, discovered that the mud was warm and soothing, and began to doze. When he woke, his leprosy (if that’s indeed what it was) had magically disappeared. Bladud returned in triumph to his father’s hearth and resumed his place as his heir-apparent. In gratitude for his own cure, he told others of the miraculous mud and created a sort of shrine nearby. In later life, he was associated with all sorts of necromancy, wizardry and witchcraft. According to legend. he even tried his hand at flying, but ran into a brick wall — literally! More than 600 years after Bladud’s discovery of the healing spring, the Romans re-discovered the place and, in the Roman style, created an elaborate bathing complex on the site. They called it Aquae Sulis. The more pragmatic Britons simply called it Bath.

I am originally from India and I now call Australia home. When I arrived in Perth in 2015, I knew no one here. For the first 6 months, my life revolved solely around my work place and home and some trips to local places of interest – alone. Having lived a very social and outgoing life in India, I found it difficult at first to adjust to my new life in Perth. After spending a few weeks in a new country, one does feel overwhelmed at the shocking drop in social interaction. It’s in times like these that you need to figure out how to build a network in your new hometown. Here are a few tips from my own experiences in Australia: 1. Your neighbors: Start with your neighbors. When you see them out and about, simply stop by to say hi and introduce yourself. You might be surprised by the response that you receive! If you are too shy for this, you may drop hand-written notes in your neighbors’ letter boxes, so when they see you next time, at least they know your name – it’s an easy way to initiate a conversation! 2. Your local library: Visit your local library and register yourself. Look for opportunities to volunteer. Sessions like CoderDojo forums for teenagers, or basic computer classes for senior citizens are very popular at local libraries. Volunteer for such sessions. 3. Toastmasters: Look for a Toastmasters club in your area. Your local library could have information about this. Toastmasters is a great way to improve your communications skills in a safe environment, is often open for individuals of all skill levels and is a great way to meet new people and make friends. 4. Learn a new art/ skill: You will often find free art and craft classes advertised at your local library. Similarly your local Bunnings store will often conduct workshops for different trades. So if something like glass painting or woodwork or carpentry interests you, go ahead and make the most of such opportunities. 5. Local neighborhood events: Visit local events in your neighborhood. These are a great way to understand which family businesses operate in your locality and give you the chance to listen to/ watch some local artists while they perform. You might also consider volunteering for such events - managing traffic on local streets or directing vehicles towards car parks etc. 6. Sign up for a flyer distribution service: This serves multiple purposes. Firstly, if you are new to a place and are looking to make some money, this lets you do that. Secondly, you get to explore nearby localities entirely - down to every nook and corner of every street. And thirdly, while distributing flyers, you come across people mowing their lawns or walking their dogs. Chatting with people gives you the opportunity to hone your “small talk” skills and potentially lets you widen your network. Just a word of caution – it’s small talk, avoid getting too overbearing! :) 7. Your local pub: Visit your local pub over the weekend and try to mingle with the local. More than going with an agenda of “expanding your network” you may treat this as an opportunity to learn the local culture, the lingo, the humor (I found Aussie humor pretty difficult to understand at first), the sports that the locals follow, and social etiquette in general. 8. Meetup: The [LINKED_TEXT: Meetup] [URL: https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/] app is by far your best friend for finding people with similar interests in your vicinity. You will be surprised to see how many Meetup groups operate in your city, both - for professional as well as social purposes. Meetup groups are often the best source for meeting new people and expanding your network. Most importantly, understand that you are in a new place and that it will take a while for you to develop meaningful associations with people around you. In the meanwhile, be outgoing, be courteous, be respectful and most importantly, be friendly!"},{"prompt":"Why is butter, rather than the healthier margarine, served in restaurants?","completion":"it tastes better"},{"prompt":"Will Node.js replace many backend technologies?","completion":"Not ever.

There are far more hydro plants than there are nuclear plants, with tens of thousands of the former but only 450 of the latter. Mind you, nuclear plants are big installations, and hydro plants can range in size from the massive Three Gorges Dam, producing 22,500 MW, all the way down to a small millrace in a creek that produces a few hundred Watts. A large hydro plant has a bigger footprint than an equivalent nuclear power station, and has much tighter geographical requirements since it needs a regular and sizable water flow combined with a significant fall in elevation. Nuclear plants need water as well for cooling, but a river or lake is usually quite sufficient."},{"prompt":"Why didn't Bill kill Beatrix when he had the chance just before they fought at the end of Volume 2?","completion":"For some reason, I think Bill wanted to know that Beatrix had her daughter while she was in the coma and actually finish her job of killing the ones involved with the massacre at her wedding and the reason why she’s on this hunt in the first place. Also when he was talking to Elle in Vol. 1 before she had killed while she was still in her coma, he talked about how he ‘put a bullet in her head, but her heart just kept on beating.’ He goes on to say that the Deadly Vipers did horrible things to her (at the wedding) and when she woke up, they were going to do a whole lot more. So he purposely stopped the whole mission of Elle going to the hospital and killing her with a poison that would eventually kill her in her sleep because Bill was worried about being seen as a man who took cheap shots and the ‘easy way’ when it came to getting rid of the enemy. But really he knew that when she woke up that she would wreak havoc on those who wronged her. So keeping her alive at the hospital was him already waiting for his eventual death by the hands of Beatrix Kiddo."},{"prompt":"Did Pervitin make a measurable difference to the success of Blitzkrieg in WWII?","completion":"No, and anyone who claims so either has no idea how World War II warfare works or how methamphetamine works. The telltale example that the proponents of ‘drug-fueled Blitzkrieg’ argument like to trot out is Guderian and Kleist’s rampage across Northern France, during Fall Gelb after breaking through the Ardennes- so let us examine it. Guderian’s vanguard crossed the Meuse on 11 May, and after pitched fighting around the bridgehead, Guderian started his westwards thrust on the morning of 14 May. German reconnaissance units from the 2. Panzer-Division made it to the Channel on 20 May, with the rest of the division arriving the next day. That’s a week of almost non-stop advance. Do you know what happens if you run on methamphetamine for a week? It is true that methamphetamine makes a person energetic, aggressive, and removes fatigue. But those last only as long as you are running on a methamphetamine high- and running on a methamphetamine high for a week and under such physical strain would likely kill you. Period. Of course, even if it didn’t, the fatigue would, because not feeling fatigue is not the same as not being tired, and excessive physical exertion is exactly as harmful to someone on Pervitin as it is to someone who isn’t. And of course, if the action of crashing through to the Atlantic wasn’t tiring enough to cause this kind of breakdown(even discounting the devastating effects of an extended methamphetamine high)… then why need methamphetamine to combat fatigue? Remember, you can’t take a break in taking drugs, either. Because as mentioned above methamphetamine doesn’t actually get rid of fatigue. It merely makes you feel like it did, and the moment the effects of methamphetamine are over, the combined effect of the drug crash and the accumulated fatigue would hit like a sledgehammer and the German soldiers thus affected would be sleeping for the next couple days. If Guderian’s panzers were as high on Pervitin as people often claim, those troops would be dying en masse of heart attacks or crashing down into a zombie-like sleepiness before they even made it to the Atlantic. As anyone with even the most cursory knowledge of the battle for France knows, neither of those happened. Guderian’s Panzer troopers cross the Meuse, 12 May 1940. Not to mention… Even if the soldiers on meth were able to physiologically tolerate the strain of the extended high and the physical strain of war simultaneously, a soldier on an extended meth high is a terrible soldier. The following is extracted from the story of an actual meth addict: At one stage, he went on a 10-day binge, where he smoked more than 7500 worth of meth and was consumed by fantasies, starting with the recurring belief that he was at the airport waiting to get on a plane to Thailand, when he was, in fact, in his bedroom. He told me that after a while, “I became convinced it was all part of a TV show plot, and that my life was a TV show, and I was being filmed all the time. “Like The Truman Show?” I asked. “Yes” Jack replied “exactly like The Truman Show,” and he went on to relate how he had once confronted a girl (who had rejected him) about her role on this TV show — she, quite naturally, freaked out. “Eventually I started kind of performing for the camera,” he explained. “So one day I got home after a day of smoking, believing that the cameras were on me, and I thought to myself what a boring day it had been, and that the viewers probably would have been really annoyed with me. So I stood up in my lounge room and broke out in this mad dance for 15 minutes just so the audience would be entertained.” Does it look like this is the sort of mindset that would bring you success in a campaign if you could put your soldiers into it? In fact, speaking about that… another severe blow to the whole ‘German soldier on crack’ myth is that. From Sedan to Noyelles-sur-Mer, German troops covered a little over 300 kilometers in about a week. A fit, trained person, if he didn’t have to worry about providing his own food, could do that on foot. A Roman legion could come close to marching that distance in the same time. The astonishing part of that achievement isn’t the physical strain. It’s the organizational achievement. It’s pushing through the enemy formations, it’s moving an entire panzer group through clogged up roads, it’s keeping them supplied, it’s maintaining air cover, ensuring maintenance of cohesion, providing fuel and spare parts, preventing and dealing with traffic jams. Guderian’s dash to the Channel isn’t a physically impressive feat: it’s an organizationally impressive feat. Pervitin doesn’t help with that. 7. Panzer-Division moves through France. This was the kind of challenge Germans had to deal with, hundreds of tanks and trucks that all needed supplies, all advancing through congested roads with breakneck speed. It was a monumental feat to keep these formations coherent and supplied and well organized- but it was not a feat that would be helped with any possible application of Pervitin. The single most common source of the Pervitin used by German soldiers on the front line actually was from their relatives back home, which soldiers often asked things including Pervitin to cope with the mental stress of war from. This lasted until 1941, when the Wehrmacht brutally cracked down on such deliveries from the home front. In terms of actual military-issue Pervitin, there were two common methods in which it could be used. One was for medicinal purposes, especially on the Eastern Front where it was used to assist in emergency care of hypothermia. Two was in cases where you needed those troops fighting now, and you didn’t need them for the next couple days, and preferably had somewhere safe to rest them. Pilots, especially those operating in the Defense of the Reich campaign, were common users of Pervitin for this reason: they could use it for intensive operations lasting a day or two, and then spend the next day or two sleeping it off in the barracks of their airfield. Long-lasting Pervitin highs, of the kind people are so often falsely believe to have brought Germans their 1940 success, were nonexistent. You’d think it would clue someone that the book that popularized that nonsense, Norman Ohler’s Blitzed, was written by a journalism school graduate with no history education whatsoever who hadn’t written a single book that was not fiction until that point- although, having read it, I could assure you that Ohler still hasn’t written a book that isn’t fiction. Pervitin made no measurable difference to German military success. It wasn’t used in large enough quantities to do so, and even if it was, it would have done far more harm than good to the German military machine and would have stifled rather than create victories. The notion of Hitler being carried to victory on the back of drug addicts is a revoltingly persistent myth, an attempt to reduce the culmination of two centuries of martial excellence and military know-how to the drugged rage of a junkie. It is born out of a pathological denial to admit that the German soldier prevailed because he was better trained and better led. When someone claims fervently that German military success was born out of drug abuse, what they’re actually telling you is that they’re so appalled at the fact that the German soldier fought and won fair and square in 1940 that they’d rather make up flat out lies so they can pretend there was a hidden reason to it rather than admitting what is the case. It’s them saying ‘but… but… they must have cheated!’"},{"prompt":"w much would it cost to crowdfund a mission using SpaceX to catch up and explore Oumuamua?","completion":"Protip: When a question essentially asks if X is possible, and X doesn’t actually contradict any known laws of physics (e.g. travel faster than light or [LINKED_TEXT: perpetuum mobile] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetuum_mobile]), your immediate reaction should be - yes, it’s possible.

To catch up with ʻOumuamua we need a accelerate an object to be just a little fast than that. Don’t get me wrong, this is very fast. And there are no existing space ships that can reach such velocities. However, if all we want is to propel a small bullet-like object, that shouldn’t be too hard. This “bullet” need only contain a camera, a tiny radio transmitter, a computer-on-chip, a long aerial wire, and miniaturized [LINKED_TEXT: radioisotope thermoelectric generator] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator] at the end of it, to provide power.

I tend to prefer fights that aren't quite the same thing every time or ones where you're doing something different for the entire duration while still being challenging. If it doesn't fall into one of these two categories, it better be a shorter fight like Nefra. The most variable fight is Master and Blaster in Ravagers, so often you have to make split second decisions and the mines and circle placements make every fight different. Tyrans in Dread Palace is another great example of this where I think there's really a perfect balance of consistency and dynamicism. Personally, I think fights like Tyth in Gods of the Machine goes a little far with this idea, there's just a few too many moving parts for my liking. On the different things throughout the fight side of things, you have fights like Gate Commander Draxus in Dread Fortress, Revan in Temple of Sacrifice, and Kephess in Explosive Conflict, and really all of God's from the Machine except for Tyth. It's hard to feel bored in fights like these because you're constantly doing something different. This does mean that it can feel less like you're fighting an actual boss though My overall favorite operation based on the fights is Dread Palace, I really like Bestia, Tyrans and the final Council fight there. In terms of looks, my favorite raid is Terror From Beyond, Gree technology looks so cool! There are also fights that are really not fun, particularly if they're really buggy or there are too many boring, repetitive sections without exciting things to do; especially if these mechanics are extremely punishing if you mess them up. Styrak from Scum and Villainy is the best example of this, almost 20 minutes of doing the same simple thing over and over again and you wipe if you mess it up once. Underlurker and Revanite Commanders from Temple of Sacrifice are other great examples of these two problems. Underlurker is too buggy and it isn't all that exciting, no one likes to wipe when it isn't their fault. Revanite Commanders is just a worse version of Draxus."},{"prompt":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","completion":"A story from my imagination world.... “Why were you talking with that girl?”, she asked him with jealousy. “Because I want you to fall for me again and again”, he replied with a smile.

However, this other person will not be aware of many of the implementation details. In other words, IMO, tests should ideally be written by both the developer writing the production code and a separate person/team. More specifically unit tests, which describe the intended behavior of specific functions/classes should usually be written by the developer writing the functions/classes they test. Integration/acceptance tests, that test the behavior of the system as a whole, can benefit from being written by other people. It is, of course, possible to write unit tests through pair programming, and that can be helpful, but it’s not always very practical, since they would need to be able to pair program rather consistently."},{"prompt":"What is the new income tax slab of 202122?","completion":"Greetings, In Budget 2020, the Indian Finance Minister introduced a ‘New tax regime’ with more tax slabs and lower tax rates. Therefore, now you have two options to select from: Old Tax RegimeNew Tax Regime However, the new tax regime has come with the catch of removal of all the deductions and exemptions that were available under the old tax regime. Here are some of the most common exemptions and deductions availed by Indian taxpayers If you opt for the new tax regime, all these exemptions and deductions will not bring down your taxable income Over the last 3 years, only a few opted for the New Tax Regime. Most taxpayers continued with the Old Regime as they could save higher taxes than the New one. In this year’s Budget, the government has made the New Tax Regime more attractive. It has changed the tax slab and added incentives to it. There are five such key changes. Let’s discuss them one by one. 1. Less Tax Slabs In The New Tax Regime First, the government has changed the tax slabs. You can see the previous and revised versions in the following table: As you can see, the New Tax Regime introduced in Feb 2020 Budget had seven slabs. But now the government has reduced them to six slabs. The tax outgo will be lower in the new one compared to the earlier slabs. Now let’s look at the tax slabs in the Old Tax Regime: 2. ZERO Tax For People Earning Less Than Rs 7 Lakh A Year Second, the government is offering a rebate to taxpayers earning up to Rs 7 lakh. This is a significant change. Your tax outgo will be zero if your taxable income is less than Rs 7 lakh now. Until now, this limit was Rs 5 lakh in the New Tax Regime. So, if you are earning up to Rs 7 lakh, opting for the New Tax Regime is actually attractive. You don’t have to worry about investing in tax-saving instruments like ELSS, PPF, etc. 3. Standard Deduction In New Tax Regime To Make It More Attractive Now, let’s talk about the third change. The government has introduced Standard Deduction in the New Tax Regime. This is an interesting concept. In the old regime, the salaried class used to submit medical and transport bills to claim deductions from their salaries. The government realized that this was a burden. So, it introduced standard deduction. Taxpayers could claim a straight deduction without submitting any bills. The government has brought this to the New Tax Regime. Each salaried person with an income of more than Rs 15.5 lakh can claim a standard deduction of Rs 52,500. So, if your taxable income is Rs 20 lakh, the standard deduction will reduce the taxable income to nineteen lahks forty-seven thousand and five hundred rupees (19,47,500). 4. Less Suracharge Means Less Tax For The Super Rich The fourth change pertains to the reduction in the tax rate for individuals in the highest tax bracket. Currently, if you earn more than Rs 5 crore a year, you pay 42.74% tax. This is among the highest in the world. And it’s because these taxpayers pay a high surcharge rate of 37%. This will now be reduced to 25%. This would result in a reduction of their maximum tax rate to 39% in the new tax regime instead of 42.74% earlier. 5. Leave Encashment For Retirees. There’s some good news for people who are retiring. At present, employees don’t need to pay tax when they encash leaves on retirement and receive a benefit of up to Rs 3 lakh in exchange. This limit is now increased to Rs 25 lakh. There was one big surprise in the budget in relation to the New Tax Regime. The government has set the New Tax Regime as the default tax regime. If you don’t want it, you will need to opt for the Old one. Hope this helps! If you learned something new, UPVOTE and SHARE to help us reach more readers.

However, life is short to do each and everything by oneself. It is always important to learn from other experience too. The following things are according to my experience one should avoid to do: Never repeat mistakes- Life is to short to repeat your mistakes over and over again. Otherwise you will end up moving around in circles.Don’t judge a book by its cover- We should not judge others. Everyone is going through something which we cannot guess. Be kind and respect everyone’s journey.Don’t lose balance of life- Balanced life is beautiful and peaceful. Avoid prioritizing things beyond a limit. Try to maintain balance between the important things in your life.Don’t run after perfection- “Prefect is enemy of good’. Avoid spending lots of time to turn the things from good to perfect. Otherwise you can end wasting your lots of time in this fast moving world.Don’t expect from others- Don’t expect anything from others if you had helped them. This is best way to live a happy life.Don’t lose contact with good persons- Always try to stay in contact with the persons who added values or blessings to your life. Good persons are rarer and try to keep them.Don’t be rigid in your thoughts- We are programmed according to our environment. Try to see the things from every aspect.Don’t be a part of race- Avoid to do things which you are not really wants to do.

More specifically, what should I do to find my most interested area?","completion":"You should choose you sub-specialty between 6 and 12 months into grad school. (US centric) The idea of choosing a 'specialization' within a discipline (here Math), is something that should be done in grad school. There are several reasons for this: 1) When applying to grad school you want an open mind and be willing to accept new ideas and interests.2) In undergrad you should use the time to explore as much as possible, both within your research interests and in general.3) Upon entering grad school you want to interview with professors (2 way interviews) to figure out where the best fit is, and this is NOT only research focussed - there are other factors such as personality fit and group size/culture, and so on.4) You want to use the first semester in grad school really getting a good fundamental knowledge base in you broad discipline (Math for the OP). Essentially, I strongly advise against being tied to a single interest area too early, where too early is definitely any time in undergrad. You want to go into grad school with an insatiable hunger for learning about the field broadly. On a personal level, I was completely detached from a specific interest when I entered grad school. I knew I liked Physics and Materials Science, and made sure I could switch departments at my chosen school if needed - and ended up in a Chemical engineering lab."},{"prompt":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","completion":"I’m a landlord and it all comes down to the market.

AngularJS (also known as Angular 1) is an open-source JavaScript framework that was released by Google in 2010. It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and allows developers to create dynamic, single-page applications. AngularJS uses two-way data binding, which means that changes made in the model are immediately reflected in the view and vice versa. It also provides directives, which are markers on the DOM that tell AngularJS to attach specific behavior to an element. On the other hand, Angular (also known as Angular 2+) is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and was also released by Google in 2016. It is based on the Model-View-View Model (MVVM) architecture and allows developers to create complex, scalable applications. Angular uses a component-based approach, where each component has its own template, styling, and logic. It also uses one-way data binding, which means that changes made in the model are only reflected in the view, and not the other way around. Some other differences between AngularJS and Angular include: Language: AngularJS is written in JavaScript, while Angular is written in TypeScript.Performance: Angular is faster and more efficient than AngularJS, thanks to features like ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and lazy loading.Mobile support: Angular has better mobile support than AngularJS, with features like native mobile app development and responsive design.Dependency injection: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system, while AngularJS requires a separate library to achieve the same functionality. Overall, while both AngularJS and Angular are powerful web application development frameworks, Angular is more modern, efficient, and scalable, making it a better choice for complex, large-scale applications.

That was around 1990 or so, i.e., LONG before he became President; not even a Presidential candidate! This \\"genius\\" attribute has been later confirmed when he came along as candidate. It is well known, a real genius seldom agrees with normal and dumb people. That's why MENSA has been created to help geniuses cope with their difficulties in life. Donald J Trump apparently meets all those expectations, including his difficulties to agree with Democrats and their supporters, who are mostly of lower IQs. Most low IQ people are not able to follow his quick and sharp way of thinking. That's why they call him being \\"incoherent\\". Having high IQ myself, I can follow his way of thinking; most of the time I can even ANTICIPATE what his response to a certain problem would be. It is also well known (you may consult with psychologists) that a person of some high IQ would easily estimate IQs of people lower than him/herself, but not the other way around. That's why most Dems say Trump has low IQ. They instead praised Obama of high IQ, which I donot agree at all ever since he was a Presidential candidate. There is neither logic nor reason in Obama's opinions. Obama's arguments did not arise from his logic or reason, but from his subjective hatred towards white people and Christians. Again, my estimate of Obama's IQ was later confirmed by Donald Trump, who said repeatedly, Obama is not smart at all!"},{"prompt":"w can I transfer ownership?","completion":"When you are up for a[LINKED_TEXT: domain transfer] [URL: https://clients.temok.com/cart.php?a=add&domain=transfer] you’ll need two things: a domain that’s still active, and an account on the platform where you want to transfer it to.

Rapid weight loss can have negative effects on your body and may not lead to long-term success. However, if you're looking to jumpstart your weight loss journey, here are some tips to help you lose weight more quickly: Reduce Caloric Intake: Create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than your body burns. This can be achieved by eating smaller portions, choosing lower-calorie foods, and avoiding high-calorie, processed snacks and sugary beverages.Focus on Whole Foods: Prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods like lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats. These foods can help you feel fuller for longer and provide essential nutrients.Mindful Eating: Pay attention to what you're eating and eat slowly. This can help you recognize when you're full and prevent overeating.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking.Limit Sugar and Processed Carbs: Minimize your intake of added sugars and refined carbohydrates, as they can contribute to weight gain. Choose complex carbs and whole grains instead.Increase Protein Intake: Protein can help you feel full and satisfied, and it also supports muscle maintenance. Include lean protein sources like chicken, fish, eggs, beans, and legumes in your meals.Regular Physical Activity: While exercise is not the primary focus here, staying active can help boost your metabolism and create a larger calorie deficit. Incorporate light activities like walking, taking the stairs, or doing household chores.Reduce Sodium Intake: High sodium intake can lead to water retention and bloating. Choose low-sodium options and avoid highly processed foods.Control Portion Sizes: Be mindful of portion sizes to prevent overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes visually.Intermittent Fasting: This eating pattern involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. It can help reduce calorie intake and promote weight loss, but it may not be suitable for everyone. Consult a healthcare professional before trying intermittent fasting.Get Enough Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can interfere with weight loss efforts by affecting hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism.Stress Management: Practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga. Stress can contribute to overeating and weight gain.Consult a Professional: Before making significant changes to your diet or lifestyle, consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to ensure you're pursuing a safe and appropriate approach to weight loss. Remember, the goal is to create sustainable habits that you can maintain over time. Rapid weight loss may be motivating, but focusing on gradual, long-term changes is more likely to lead to lasting success.

These very top tier private schools can therefore can hire the best professors, have the best teacher-student ratios, and are better resourced all-around. However, none of these things are true when talking about the AVERAGE private university. However, there are countries that fund their public universities very well in comparison to the United States, where the opposite holds true. In Spain and Portugal, for instance, public universities are extremely well funded and they are tuition-free to the students. They are very competitive to get into to (wonder why?) and attract the best students and best professors as a result.

It takes some more time in some countries depending on the people, politicians and the history of the people of that country. US had a far better start in time as it gained independence in 1776. India got independence in 1947. But still, if you compare how these countries started their countries, India had better start as an independent country even though US had about 170 years headstart. All citizens of India are treated equally among law since its independence. Unlike US where citizens were slaves and others are slaveowners in the beginning. And its just not about corruption, people are easily fooled by their own leaders. There's never been an actual democracy in the world till now.

I opened the door and she followed me in my cabin. She was twirling on the office chair while thinking about something, at first I neglected it and thought that she was in her own world thinking about her office. Then she took the paper weight ball in her hand from the table and started spinning it, this time out of curiosity I asked her the reason behind her uneasiness. She- Akshu, today I received a call from my friend, she said to me that one of her relative was admitted to a superspeciality hospital in Mumbai. Me- So? It’s nice right, that she’ll receive a good treatment. She- Ya but it happened when her condition started to deteriorate because they were short on money to admit her.

Also she took a job in a company to bear the expenses of home. Post the discussion, I asked the office helper and security to lock the office and we started our drive back home.

I started with a Prius Plug-In Hybrid. It only had a batter range of about 12 miles, but many of my errands were well less than 12 miles. But, I’d always return home with at least 6 miles still on the battery. If I accelerated a little too fast, or turned on the heat or the A/C, the gas engine would kick in. Thus, I’d be using gas even though I had plenty of battery for my entire trip. I got frustrated and started thinking of a solution of how I could drive an EV without a gas engine kicking in. It was obvious. Buy an EV with no gas engine at all and the gas engine would never kick in. Hence I sold my 2012 Plug-In Prius and purchased a 2013 Tesla Model S 85. I was happy with it, but it had very few features, not even proximity alerts. So I traded that in for a 2015 Tesla Model S P85DL and still have that car now with 50,000 miles. Also in 2014 we ordered a Tesla Model X P90DL for my wife which wasn’t delivered until a couple of years later. We also still own that vehicles with 40,000 miles and are extremely happy with it even though it was an early production model (#256) with all the early problems. Tesla resolved all those problems for free and we may keep this car forever. I think a lot of Tesla owners, especially from the early years, may have previously owned a hybrid and graduated to a Tesla when they realized they really don’t need a gasoline engine to have an acceptable driving range."},{"prompt":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","completion":"High protein vegetarian food options in Indian cuisine people who go to the gym to bulk up while also losing fat.

Let’s call her S to make it easier. When S was a teenager she slammed her bedroom door twice…the first time she got told that if she did it again, her door would be removed. A couple of days later S slams the door again. The next day she comes back from school and her door wasn’t there… She obviously got angry at her parents and started asking to get her door back and how unfair it was that they’d removed it. Mom and dad told her that she’d been warned, and that the door would only come back on once she was able to talk things through and not slam doors or walk out of the room. The door eventually came back on with a bigger dose of respect and improved communication. At some point she wouldn’t come to eat dinner because she was “in the middle of a game” after a few warnings and such, she ended up not having dinner at the appointed time. Her parents ended up not making a fuss, but when she got home from school and attempted to resume playing, she found all her games were there, except for the one she’d been playing the night before. When S asked her mom about it, she said she’d removed the reason for her not eating dinner with the rest of the family, hoping she’d be able to make it tonight. Once again S couldn’t really complain, so she ended up learning to prioritize family dinner over her games. But the one I liked the most, was the “I don’t have anything to wear for the party on Friday”. After complaining for a few days and her mom suggesting tons of different outfits she could wear, she came home to a pair of jeans, a couple of T-shirts, a few pairs of socks as well as a jacket and a pair of shoes. When she opened her closet door, she really had “nothing to wear”. In this instance her mom made a point of showing her that “nothing to wear” and nothing to wear isn’t the same.

Their origin goes back to Iranians (Persians) and Kurds.” Now I just paste that answer. This is complete bullshit of Persian propoganda in order to calm down Azerbaijan Turks and other Turkich nations inside. It is bullshit because in the 1-st: language is so strong characteristics that it can’t vanish neither in 1 day, no in 1–2–3… centuries. Say, Yakuts , Chechens, Tatarians or Azerbaijan Turks have been for long time inside Russian empire but they preserved their languages despite some mixed marriages. Languages don’t evaporate during a few centuries and can’t be easily forgotten or changed because are given to children from parents inside family despite the official state language. “Turkification” as well “Russification” are myths of not clever scientists. I think not less than 3–5 thousand years are necessary for full change of a language of 1 big nation ( such as Azerbaijanian Turks, around 35 millions in total) and also brutal control and forcing not to talk in the native about which we never heard in the history. Yes, nations may disappear but not their languages ( e.g. latin). In the 2-nd, it is bullshit, because haplogroup ( genetics on the level of DNA) of Azerbaijanians despite it is mixed is closer with autochthonous Caucasians and Turks of Turkey and mainly is J2 than J1 or Q of Iranian group of nations ( Persians, Kurds and others.)."},{"prompt":"Why is encryption so much easier than decryption in cryptography?","completion":"For standard symmetric key algorithms, encryption and decryption have about the same complexity.

It is commonly built in two configurations - Foam based and Spring based. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. As a thumb rule, springs having diameter in the range of 1.3-1.7 mm (14 to 16-gauge) make up for a high quality mattress which provides the best balance between firmness and cushioning and provides the best support to the body.Whereas, the springs having diameters above 1.7 mm (12 gauge) make the mattress too firm and it no longer remains supportive or comfortable. Whereas, Foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or other who prefer body hugging comfort. On the other hand, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should decide on according to the dimensions of the bed and awareness about the ways by which some brands cut manufacturing costs and produce low-grade mattresses which cause several neck and spine issues too play influential roles in determining the product one should opt for. I gained in-depth knowledge about them from the post - [LINKED_TEXT: Vibhor Shergill's answer to The extensive guide to purchasing a new Mattress.] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] So, today, i.e., 18th August, 2021, at 2:57 PM, I placed the order for my mattress, keeping the insights gained in consideration.

Lundstrom. The Japanese simply couldn’t remove him because of their belief on the impact on the Japanese people. The removal of Nagumo would have been a signal of an enormous loss at Midway when the people were given the assumption Midway was a victory. And as explained by others posting here, his decisions were not overwhelmingly bad. He was hamstrung as an operational admiral by decisions by Yamamoto, and did what he could given his limitations. The failure at Midway went deep into the philosophy of the IJN and the military in general, in which all out attack was their mode. The stalemate in the Coral Sea which contributed to the loss of the Shokaku and the Zuikaku for the operation meant they loss operational effectiveness by a third.

Cosmic rays, solar radiation, carbon/potassium/uranium/thorium/radium/… decaying. Any planet/moon without a magnetosphere / ozone layer gets a LOT of radiation. A nuclear weapon produces a lot of extra radiation for a few years, after that its measurable, but not substantially more dangerous than radiation that already is hitting that area. Cosmic rays are particularly dangerous on the moon/mars. High energy protons/betas, that have both penetrating capability and the power to do damage (the worst of gamma radiation combined with the worst of alpha radiation). On earth cosmic rays decay to muons, loosing a lot of their energy. Our bodies can handle muons just fine (otherwise we’d get cancer just from being outside at night frequently). Anyhow that assumes cancers are caused by single DNA damage to a single cell, which is proven to be false. Living things have radiation repair mechanisms. It takes repeated punishment and a failure in such mechanisms for cancer to occur. Nuclear weapons are dangerous to living things. For planets / moons devoid of life, they might leave a crater, or transform dust into glass. That’s all. Jupiter is a gas giant, if a nuke is thrown at the Jovian atmosphere if its not set to detonate at ultra high altitudes, the massive pressure buildup will likely destroy the ignition circuits and deform the core so it will fizzle/fail to detonate. The massive atmosphere and strong wings will dilute the radiation and in a few hours the radiation will be hard to measure. The Venus atmosphere would also corrode and try to crush the nuclear weapon as well. Likely would fizzle / fail to detonate."},{"prompt":"What are the best color of loafers to buy that go with almost everything (jeans, chinos)?","completion":"Since you mention jeans, chinos, I’m assuming you are primarily looking at casual outfits.

Should I let him?","completion":"My 3-year-old insists on sleeping on the floor. Should I let him? Assuming the floor is relatively clean, there’s nothing wrong with that. As a kid I had a bed, but often napped on the floor in the sunshine (my bedroom was on the side of the house without sunshine). In college I continued that, I normally slept on the bed in my dorm room, but generally if I took a nap with a migraine, the concrete floor with a thin carpet was more comfortable. After college when I moved into my own apartment my parents didn’t initially have room in the car to pack my old bed, so I temporarily slept on the floor, for 10 years. If I visited others’ houses, or stayed in a hotel, I found beds with bedsprings to be uncomfortably soft and hard to sleep on. When I lived in India for a decade I always slept on a bed, but the beds were generally harder, and had no bedsprings, just a mattress on top of plywood. And the floors in all my flats were hard tiles with no carpets or rugs. Here in New York City, I slept on the floor for the first few years, using a sleeping bag on the hardwood floor. Then my wife got her green card and flew over, and we set up a nest of blankets on the floor as a bed. I liked it, she hated it. She used inflatable mattresses off and on, but none had a long life before leaking. Now we have a bed that was given to us. She likes it, I don’t. Most of the time I sleep on the living room floor so that she can watch TV in bed without disturbing me, since we have very different waking hours. I use a CPAP machine which records the number of breathing “events” I have every night (an “event” being a bad thing, the fewer the healthier). When I sleep on the bed there’re about double the number of events that I have when I sleep on the floor. So I guess the more firm floor is better for my health than the softer bed.

I haven’t gone through all the 100+ answers to this question but I am sure the perspective which I intend to present isn’t a popular one. The stigma attached to beard in a country like Pakistan is quite real. Pakistan has been toiling with terrorism for a couple of decades now. It is true that there are legitimate flaws/factors in the society which contributed to the proliferation of terrorism in this region.After 9/11 , more specifically , dynamics of Pakistani society has experienced a huge change which has led to a dichotomous bifurcation in the society. The bifurcation is more like an ideological one and both the sides consist of self righteous people who don’t flinch a little while dismissing any moderate idea which could be detrimental for their cult following . Anyways, my adolescence decided to hit me like a train in the timeline which perfectly aligned with the post 9/11 shenanigans of the world. As happens with the most boys (some girls too ) , that puberty announces its arrival in the form of facial hair. As fate would have it , my beard decided to show up earlier than boys of my age. On top of that I decided to keep my beard for strictly religious/domestic reasons. I still remember that the principal of our school, who was a nice lady in general, asked me to shave my beard on the grounds that it (i-e ‘my’ beard) would be uncomfortable for the girls in my class. Needless to say it was a blow to the self-esteem of my teen self who happened to be a shy individual. After sometime , I come to empathize with the principal as she had a strong army background and it was an era where keeping a beard was analogous to sympathizers of Taliban. Even until now I am judged by my beard which of course is nothing in comparison to the aforementioned episode. I am glad beards are in fashion now and this trend has alleviated situations similar to mine to a great extent. PS : I am sure most of the guys who grew their beards right after 9/11 experienced hostility which had some impact on their lives, I would love to hear from them."},{"prompt":"w many countries have you travelled to and which are they?","completion":"I’ve been to 10 countries.

Syria Has a very rich and ancient history that is not well known in the world. One of the most ancient countries in the world. Bulgaria Bulgarians think everyone is against them and they have the oldest civilization in the world. In recent years, they think almost everyone has Bulgarian ancestry. Vasco da Gama might have Bulgarian ancestry for all we know. One of many treasures found in Bulgaria. This treasure alone contains more gold than what I saw in the entire National History Museum of China in Beijing. Romania Cluj-Napoca feels totally different than the Balkans.

The pilot turned the engine off late downwind. In the video you’ll notice the propeller is not moving. It was my first landing on my NNW airstrip (32/14). There was a slight 10kn left NW cross wind which the pilot allowed for. To land right on the threshold at the right speed unpowered allowing for crosswind takes skill. But back to your question. Try using a mobile phone to navigate then use a map and dead reckoning. An autopilot frees up a pilot to do other work in the cockpit. Unfortunately my joystick is on the right side of my Long EZ cockpit so it’s quite difficult to fill out a flight plan at the same time.

How can I establish a free and stable VPN for my PC?","completion":"Creating a stable and free VPN (Virtual Private Network) can be a bit complex, but I can guide you through the general steps. Keep in mind that while there are free VPN options available, they may have limitations on speed, data usage, and security. If you're looking for a reliable and secure VPN, consider investing in a reputable paid service. Here's how you can set up a basic VPN using a free option like OpenVPN: Step 1: Choose a VPN Protocol OpenVPN is a widely used open-source VPN protocol. You'll need to choose between using a VPN service provider or setting up your own VPN server using OpenVPN software. Step 2: Set Up a VPN Server (Optional) If you want to set up your own VPN server, you can follow these general steps: 1. Select a Server: Choose a server where you want to host your VPN. This could be a cloud server or a computer at your home. 2. Install OpenVPN: Install the OpenVPN software on the server. You can find installation instructions on the OpenVPN website. 3. Configure OpenVPN: Configure OpenVPN by creating a configuration file. This file will include settings like encryption, authentication, and network settings. 4. Generate Certificates: Generate SSL certificates for secure communication between the server and clients. 5. Firewall and Routing: Configure firewall rules and routing on the server to allow VPN traffic. 6. Start OpenVPN Server: Start the OpenVPN server software. Step 3: Set Up OpenVPN Client on Your PC 1. Download OpenVPN Client: Download and install the OpenVPN client software on your PC from the official OpenVPN website. 2. Download Configuration Files: If you're using a VPN service provider, they will typically provide you with configuration files. If you've set up your own server, you'll need to transfer the configuration file you created earlier to your PC. 3. Import Configuration: Open the OpenVPN client and import the configuration file you downloaded or transferred. This will include details like server address, port, encryption settings, and more. 4. Connect: Once the configuration is imported, you can click the connect button to establish a VPN connection to the server. Step 4: Test and Troubleshoot After connecting, test your VPN connection to ensure it's working as expected. Make sure you can access websites and resources securely through the VPN. Remember, setting up a VPN server and configuring clients can involve technical challenges, and the steps can vary based on the operating systems you're using (Windows, Linux, macOS). If you're not comfortable with the technical aspects, you might want to consider using a user-friendly VPN service that offers client software and support."},{"prompt":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","completion":"This is my favourite quote and most apt one for the above question.

This provides food for other creatures in what would be the water’s equivalent of a desert concerning life. An entire food chain quickly moves in to the rich environment because of the near instant source of food for the smallest in the food chain. Mosquito larvae is key food source for fish, amphibians, other aquatic insect larvae, small reptiles, etc. As winged adults birds, bats, and other insect eaters that don’t fly get a rich source of food. Then everything that eats any of these aquatic or terrestrial species would also be affected. Basically entire ecosystems would have to readjust with many losers, and virtually no winners."},{"prompt":"Why is computer engineering not growing as fast as computer science?","completion":"Because computer engineering is extremely difficult, especially when it comes to the basic level design. (This might be more EE than CompE). A CPU is made of many many many transistors. Each transistor is its own unit and therefore carries a possibility of failure during production. Even a 99.999% success rate means a pretty darn big overall failure rate with a billion transistors. In order to counter this problem, we can design better manufacturing techniques and better design techniques for the CPU so that there are many redundant features to reduce the risk of systematic failure. (So the system wont be messed up due to one failed transistor.) Based on my experience in fabrication and some knowledge of Computer engineering, I know the process of developing smart failure proof design and smart fabrication techniques is really resource consuming, both in material and time. Furthermore, we are approaching a bottleneck in transistor design in both size and performance. There is a limit to how small a transistor can be before “quantum weirdness” happens and before we reach theoretical peak performance. A lot of Computer Science is based more or less on mathematics and thinking how to think. For example, a person can easily count how many circles are on a page intuitively, yet is is pretty damn hard for a computer to do. We could apply our thinking methods and use that as an algorithm. This is a more hardware based answer, so it is best if you read more about system based answers too."},{"prompt":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","completion":"Sure!

[LINKED_TEXT: Tropical cyclones in Southern Africa - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Storms affecting Tanzania, Mozambique, and South Africa Satellite image of Cyclone Idai , one of the worst tropical cyclones on record in Africa At least 30 tropical cyclones have affected the Southern African mainland. Three southeastern African countries border the Indian Ocean – Tanzania , Mozambique , and South Africa . Other inland countries also experience the effects of tropical cyclones , including Botswana , Eswatini , Lesotho , Malawi , Namibia , Zambia , and Zimbabwe . February 15, 1950 - After crossing Madagascar, a cyclone struck eastern Mozambique and moved across much of Africa, eventually reaching northern Namibia . [2] [3] April 15, 1952 - A cyclone moved ashore southeastern Tanzania near Lindi with maximum sustained winds estimated at 180 km/h (110 mph); this made the cyclone the strongest on record to strike the country. [4] The cyclone left 34 fatalities in Tanzania. [1] January 28, 1984 - Tropical Storm Domoina struck southeastern Mozambique, and later crossed into Swaziland and eastern South Africa. In Mozambique, Domoina killed 109 people and caused about 75 million in damage. Rainfall in Swaziland reached 906 mm (35.7 in) at Piggs Peak . Damage in the country totaled 54 million, with 73 deaths. In South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950 mm (37 in, causing 100 year floods along the Umfolozi River . The Pongola River altered its course after the storm. Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the structural integrity, additional flooding occurred in Mozambique, forcing thousands to evacuate. Across South Africa, the storm caused 60 deaths and damaged the properties of 500,000 people, causing R100 million (1984 ZAR , 70 million 1984 USD). [nb 1] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] February 19, 1984 - Tropical Storm Imboa looped off the east coast of South Africa, causing flooding and killing four people in the country. [11] [8] Image of United States helicopter flying over flooded Mozambique after Cyclone Eline January 3, 2000 - A tropical depression, previously Tropical Storm Astride , struck northeastern Mozambique and produced rainfall as far inland as Malawi. [12] February 22, 2000 - Cyclone Eline moved ashore near Beira, Mozambique. Exasperating previous floods , the cyclone produced the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Water levels along the Limpopo River reached as high as 11 m (36 ft) above normal and 15 km (9.3 mi) wide. [13] [14] The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 300,000 people homeless, [15] about 700 deaths, and damage estimated at 500 million (2000 USD). [12] The cyclone and the floods disrupted much of the economic progress Mozambique had made in the 1990s since the end of its civil war . [16] Eline also killed 21 people in South Africa, where damage reached at least US300 million. [12] [17] In Zimbabwe, Eline washed away transportation infrastructure and killed 12 people.

I shift like I have ADHD, wear out rear cables in 2000 miles which is every 10 weeks when riding a lot, and broke a few in the middle of rides when my current batch had shorter life. Electronic shifting would avoid that. Eschewing Campagnolo mechanical, electronic is also the only way to shift to the next ratio moving from large to small ring in a single motion (with Campagnolo, you can hit both thumb buttons to change rings and drop up to five cogs). Electronic also moves beyond Shimano’s inward flopping combined brake/shift lever and SRAM’s single up/down lever mechanism. It would save me the trouble of rebuilding my wheels with new hubs. Usually I run a PowerTap power meter rear (works with any pedals or crank), SON28 dynamo front (I can ride as long as I feel like without running out of lights or GPS power), and retro reflective powder coated rims with more shiny surface than reflectors combined with attractive anthracite grey finish during the day. Conversely, if I lived in the Pacific Northwest I’d get disc brakes because avid riders wear out their rims in a year when combining caliper brakes, road grit, and precipitation. The stopping power of rim brakes is great in dry weather - you can’t stop any quicker once the rear wheel is off the ground which is possible braking from the hoods using modern levers, dual-pivot brakes, and Kool Stop salmon pads In practice, neither is in my near future. Cable replacement isn’t a big deal with a swap taking just a few minutes and lifetime predictable within a batch.

However, there are a few news organizations that are often recognized for their commitment to journalistic integrity and balanced reporting. Here are some examples: 1. Associated Press (AP): The AP is a nonprofit news agency that provides coverage on a wide range of topics. Their reporting is known for being factual, impartial, and widely used by various news outlets. 2. Reuters: Another respected news agency, Reuters aims to deliver unbiased and accurate news from around the world. They strive to present information without editorial bias, making them a reliable source for many. 3. BBC News: Although based in the UK, BBC News provides comprehensive coverage of both domestic and international news. Their commitment to impartial reporting has earned them a reputation for reliability and objectivity. 4. NPR (National Public Radio): NPR is a public radio network in the US that produces news and cultural programming. They aim to provide balanced reporting and are known for their in-depth coverage and diverse perspectives. 5. The Wall Street Journal: While it has a business focus, The Wall Street Journal is often regarded as a reputable news source with a commitment to objective reporting. However, it is worth noting that some critics argue it has a conservative leaning in its opinion section. 6. The New York Times: The New York Times is a widely read newspaper that covers various topics with in-depth reporting. While it has been accused of bias by some, it is generally regarded as a credible source for news. Remember that even the most respected news organizations may have some inherent biases or limitations. It is always advisable to consume news from multiple sources, cross-reference information, and critically evaluate the content to form a well-rounded understanding of a particular issue.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","completion":"The answer to this question is no, but I wonder what would be the point of anybody doing such a thing? A mother always knows if the child is biologically related to her or not—unless you asking if they switched the babies at the hospital or whatever, while fatherhood is only a state one arrives at by adoption. There is no such thing as “biological fatherhood”. This is a myth of materialism and so something our culture gets very wrong, and you can see it in how incoherent are the laws it makes in response to such questions. For example, a “biological father” in the U.S. might be forced to pay for a child he has no interested in adopting but at the same time gets no say in whether or not a pregnancy is terminated (not that I am advocating for abortion, simply acknowledging its present legality and the fact that somehow a person who because he had sex with a women is supposed to actually be the “father” but yet clearly doesn’t enjoy the same rights in regard to that child—well obviously right? Because motherhood and fatherhood are, biologically speaking, distinctly different things.) The fact is that there is no choice about fatherhood until there is a legal person because until then you don’t have a chance to adopt the person. If the law recognized this simple fact—ironically enough of nature—then the type of weird situation I just described wouldn’t be possible—and if this seems strange to anybody reading this, it just goes to show how distorted are the effects of modern society because of it pervasive commitments to materialism in obscuring one’s ability to discern the natural law, which I would assert is a huge reason for the widespread mental disorders experienced in our society, such as depression and anxiety. Consequently, if when there is a legal person and you adopt that person, then you’re the father. If later you find out that person is not biologically related to you and you want to renege on your commitments and responsibilities as a father then you’re engaging in one of the worst forms of incivility and human betrayal possible. A healthy family, by the way, has both a mother and a father as social science is readily confirming [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #ONXeR] , but here’s the problem a child must have a mother (although obviously, not all mothers are naturally fit or good mothers) but it doesn’t have to have a father, and here lies a large part of the problem with poor communities in the U.S. because of welfare, which are also in many cases minority communities. They’ve been devastated by the destruction of the family, and so they often stay poor and all the associated problems that it brings along with it. The social policies that created this injustice were based on the faulty logic of presuming that such a thing as biological fatherhood exists. So consequently and paradoxically, instead of incentivizing fathers (making for an environment inducive to wholesome families—I am not necessarily against welfare, just so-called “welfare” policies that actually hurt communities) it incentivized families without fathers on the presumption that men who might just happen to have impregnated the women were the “fathers” (and if a kid has a father then they obviously don’t need a formal situation to induce one). Again, a formal marriage allows for the father’s claim over the children—which is essentially legal and not biological. Like marriage, itself, fatherhood is a legal statement of love. Motherhood on the hand is actually biological—and nature does its best to ensure there will be love there too through a cocktail of neurochemicals [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #cPIEp] —and both of these forms of parentage are necessary and illustrative*. In life, we need both the natural and the supernatural (and law can be thought of as a type of supernatural condition—it is certainly not a condition that other animals enjoy). However, if the law is not grounded in the natural law then it simply becomes a perversity and alienates us from our own selves. So your question basically assumes a false premise that somehow you could believe yourself to be a father of the child that wasn’t actually your child on the assumption that fatherhood is somehow rooted in biology. *neurochemicals also affect the father although in this case, it doesn’t stem from the biological situation, as with the mother, but rather the social one. In fact, we could say that the neurochemistry of family making is both natural and supernatural (biological and social) in both the mother and the father, however, in different ways and to differing degrees. Edit: some people apparently think this answer is “dumb” but haven’t provided any actual arguments for while they happen to think so. Nevertheless, we can presume it is because they are committed to a materialistic metaphysical worldview, even if they might not consciously understand what a metaphysical worldview is, which then implies that they probably just adopted it passively and uncritically from the society at large. I imagine, in fact, that there are actually a lot of persons like this, and it for this very reason I wrote the answer. It’s okay to be a materialist (who am I to say otherwise?), but one should never be committed to any metaphysical beliefs unthinkingly. It is with such blind beliefs that we can and arguably should take issue. To confuse one’s mere beliefs for a self-evident fact of reality is dangerous, and from my perspective, I believe there are many beliefs that stem from assuming a materialistic metaphysics that not only should be questioned but are actually damaging our society because they’ve been left unquestioned.

The difference between vocabulary per se and the knowledge we use it to convey is actually arbitrary, since it's rare to study words for their own sake. The vocabulary most people use represents the language they have overlearned. Very few people go beyond the 7,000 or so word families used in ordinary daily interactions. If however you are a highly educated person whose active vocabulary well exceeds this average, or if you use specialized vocabulary related to your work, you will tend to use the vocabulary you use with your peers at work with everyone else around you. This is natural and, on the surface of it, this doesn't make you a jerk. However, all people are expected to adjust their speech to their purpose and their audience, and all social conversations are supposed to be sharing experiences, not simply learning experiences.

After all, who wouldn’t want to read your thoughts on topics ranging from cocktails to culture? The amount of money you make from a blog will depend on how many readers you can attract and how often they visit. If you're able to attract a large audience, you may be able to earn some side income through advertising or affiliate marketing. In this article, we'll take a look at how much money you can make from running a blog and whether it's worth the time investment for anyone with an independent mind. How Much Money You Can Make with a Blog? The money you can make with a blog will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of readers you have and how often they visit your site. If you can attract a large audience, you might be able to earn some side income through advertising or affiliate marketing. You can also monetise your blog with a range of other options, including paid product reviews and paid guest posts. Paid product reviews offer an opportunity to receive money for reviewing products, while paid guest posts are a way to gain exposure and reach a large audience. >> Get high quality [LINKED_TEXT: SEO optimized article] [URL: https://www.fiverr.com/share/Y0oRLK] or blog post within 24 hours << Popular Blogs and Their Earning Abilities One of the best ways to find out how much you can make with a blog is to take a look at the top blogs in your field. While you may not be able to follow in the footsteps of these bloggers and become a millionaire overnight, it’s helpful to see what kind of earning potential different blogs have. For example, we took a look at food blogs and found that some of the best-paying blogs in this niche earn between 1,000 and 2,000 per month. Other blogs in the same niche are much lower, with some making as little as 20 per month. When you look at other blogs, it’s important to keep in mind that income will likely vary greatly depending on your skills, your topic, and the audience you’re able to attract. An estimate of how much you can make with a blog Let’s say you have a blog that attracts 3,000 visitors per month. If you can earn 1 per visitor and get one third of your visitors to buy something from your site, that would be 300 in monthly income. If you can increase the number of visitors to 5,000 per month, you’ll have an extra 500 in monthly income. While these estimates are just that – estimates – it’s helpful to see what kind of money is being made and what you could be earning if you have a successful blog. If you want to find out how much you can make with a blog, you’ll need to find out how many people visit your site and how often they visit. Should You Start a Blog for Income? There are a few things you should keep in mind before deciding to start a blog for income. One of the most important things to consider is whether you want to make a full-time commitment to blogging. If you’re looking to make some quick cash and then put your efforts elsewhere, a blog doesn’t have to be your only option. The other thing to keep in mind is whether you have the time required to build a successful blog and keep it growing. Many bloggers have full-time jobs and other responsibilities, which can make it challenging to consistently create quality content. As with many things in life, success will likely be determined by your skillset and the type of content you’re able to create. If your blog is based around product reviews, drawing on your knowledge and expertise will be crucial. If your blog is entirely based around pop culture, you may find it difficult to attract readers. Why Is It Difficult to Find reliable Information about How Much People Make With Blogs? There are a lot of claims about how much money bloggers can make with their sites, but it’s important to keep in mind that many of these claims are based on incorrect information. Some bloggers have misinterpreted statistics or haven’t taken steps to validate their income claims. There is a lot of misleading information out there, and it can be difficult to determine what is accurate and reliable information. Finding Out Why People Don’t Earn from Blogging One of the main reasons people don’t earn from their blogs is because they don’t have the skillset required to build and maintain a successful blog. If you aren’t familiar with how to create and publish quality content, you may find it difficult to attract readers and make money from a blog. In order to be successful with a blog, you’ll need to be familiar with WordPress, understand how to use blogging software, and be comfortable with making frequent updates to your site. It may be difficult to find the time to create quality content, monetize your content, promote your content, and maintain a successful blog. Conclusion Blogging can be a great way to build your personal brand, establish yourself as an expert in your field, and to get your name out there. After all, who wouldn’t want to read your thoughts on topics ranging from cocktails to culture? The amount of money you can make with a blog will depend on how many readers you can attract and how often they visit. If you're able to attract a large audience, you may be able to earn some side income through advertising or affiliate marketing. There are a lot of reasons why people don’t earn from their blogs, but it’s important to keep in mind that many bloggers simply don’t know how to make money from their sites.

What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","completion":"IQ measures a pretty narrow spectrum of kinds of intelligence and it has problems with those, but in those areas it’s at least somewhat meaningful. So, sure, if you look at my academic and professional life, being good at that kind of intellectual processing has helped me a lot. I’ve been able to move between fields and take on new knowledge, and it didn’t seem especially hard, but more to the point, it’s been fun. I need to learn new things. This is the primary reason I headed into research. In tech, once you became known as being really good at a particular thing, there was always pressure to continue to do that thing, which tended to get tedious. Now it’s my job to do things no one has done before, and I love it. (And yes, I’m still kind of a weirdo amongst my colleagues, but it doesn’t seem to be a problem?) It was a lot harder when I was younger - I was generally out of step with my peers, and it was harder to find people I had things in common with. (It didn’t help that my mother way highly resistant to me entering the gifted program for many years.) School often wasn’t challenging - which was a problem, because I like to be challenged. Also, because I could be disruptive when bored… But as I got older, and the world opened up for me more, I found more and more people whom I could relate to. For me, at least, this helped me learn a lot about relating to people I had a lot less in common with. I like people. Most people. Though not all people in large doses. For me, learning how to talk about cooking and gardening with my neighbors was a lot of fun - kind of like learning a new language. (I hear so much complaining about small talk, and I think there’s a lot more communication going on there than many people credit.) If there’s been area that has frequently been a problem, it’s dating men. (I’m bi, so I have options, which helps.) So many men think they’re attracted to smart women, but have some kind of assumption that those women will either be less smart than them, or will be subservient to them in the relationship. My ex husband, for instance, told me that I should let him be better than me in the computer industry (where we both worked) and martial arts (our primary outside activity together) because I had “so many other things I was good at”. Aside from the absurdity of thinking this is an okay thing to ask for, I’m still blown away by the idea that I was suppose to pretend to be less good at these things than I was. (Sadly, this wasn’t just this one relationship.) I tend to think of this as a less of a problem with being bright than a problem with our society thinking it’s reasonable to cast women as supporting characters in their own lives. And I certainly know plenty of men who are perfectly lovely. But let’s return to how IQ only measures a fairly narrow span of intelligence. Sure, there are ways having a high IQ can make life a bit harder when you’re young. But most of the rest of things either points to other areas where you might have deficits, or things that you can go out and fix. Communication skills are something that you can work on. What is the internet for if not for finding groups of people you have things in common with? (Okay, we know this. The internet is for cat pics and porn.)"},{"prompt":"What are the differences between Madhva and Shankaracharya in terms of their interpretation of Vedanta?","completion":"Both Madhvācārya and Śaṅkarācārya have established two distinct Saṃpradāyas i.e. Tattvavāda and Daśanāmi, each with its divergent theological position and contrasting philosophy. Dvaitavāda of Madhvācārya- Madhvācārya evolved a dualistic school of thought from the Prasthānatraya viz. the Upaniṣads, Vedas, and Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, and thus proposed the Dvaitavāda/Bhedavāda philosophy. The Dvaita doctrine holds the individual Self i.e. Jīvātman eternally different from the Supreme Self i.e. Paramātmā. Madhvācārya asserts both qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls. The Saṃsāra is real, and not an illusion, and neither is it a transformation of God. The Īśvara is svatantra(independent) while the individual ātman and Prakṛti are paratantra(dependent on God) and thus have no separate existence from him. Madhvācārya asserts that God is personal and Saguṇa(with infinite attributes). The Upaniṣadic concept of Brahman denotes Viṣṇu alone(brahmaśabdaśca Viṣṇaveva), and he is one without a second, the all-mighty, omnipresent, omniscient Bhagavān. The jīvātman does not attain equality with Paramātmā through Mokṣa. It is entitled only to serve the Glorious Lord. There exists a Five-fold difference(Pañcabheda) between Īśvara(Nārāyaṇa), jīvā, and the insentient(Acit)- Īśvara-jīvā bheda-The distinction between God and the individual soulĪśvara-acit bheda-The distinction between God and matterJīvā-acit bheda-The distinction between the individual soul and matterJīvā-jīvā bheda-The distinction between one soul and anotherAcit-acit bheda-The distinction between one material thing and another Advaitavāda of Śankarāchārya- The philosophical position as put forward by Śankarāchārya is of exclusive non-dualism i.e. Kevalādvaita. The entire doctrine of Advaita can be summed up in half a shloka from Brahmajñānāvalīmālā- brahma satyaṃ jaganmithyā jīvo brahmaiva nāparaḥ Basically, Śankarāchārya stated that The Brahman alone is real, the Jagat(world) is unreal and the Jīvātman and Paramātmā are non-dual. Brahman itself is absolutely homogeneous. All differences and plurality are illusionary and arise only due to Ajñāna or ignorance. Brahman is all-full, infinite, changeless, self-existent, self-delight, self-knowledge, and self-bliss. It is the svarūpa i.e.the essence of the knower. It is the Seer(Dṛṣṭa), Transcendent(Turīya ), and Silent Witness(Sākṣi). Śankarāchārya’s Supreme Brahman is impersonal, Nirguṇa(without Guṇas or attributes), Nirākāra(formless), Nirviśeṣa(without special characteristics), immutable, eternal, and Ākarta(non-agent). Brahman is non-dual(advaitam), one without a second. It has no other besides It. It is destitute of difference, either external or internal. The world is considered as a Vyāvahārika Satya i.e. relatively real, while the Brahman is considered as Pāramārthika Satya i.e. absolutely real. In fact, the world is considered a product of Māyā or Avidyā. Most importantly, to Śankarāchārya, the Jīvātman or the individual soul is only relatively real. Its individuality lasts only so long as it is subject to unreal Upādhīs or limiting conditions due to Avidyā. The Jīvātman identifies itself with the body, mind, and the senses when it is deluded by Avidyā or ignorance. It thinks, acts, and enjoys, on account of Avidyā. The Advaita school of thought also places great importance on the Four Mahāvākyas (great sayings or sentences) taken from Upadeśa Prasthāna (injunctive texts), and the Śruti Prasthāna (the starting point or axiom of revelation). These are- Prajñānam brahma – “Prajñāna is Brahman” from the Aitareyopaniṣad of the Rig VedaAyam ātmā brahma – “This Self (Atmā) is Brahman” from the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad of the Atharva VedaTat tvam asi – “You are That” from the Chāndogyopaniṣad of the Sama VedaAham brahmāsmi – “I am Brahma” from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad of the Yajur Veda Namo Nārāyaṇa!"},{"prompt":"w do I start a successful YouTube channel and become a YouTuber?","completion":"Starting a channel on YouTube can be an exciting venture.

Most agents and publishers will ask for a query letter, which is a brief overview of your book, along with a synopsis and the first few chapters of the manuscript.Follow up: Publishers and agents are often swamped with submissions, so be prepared for a long wait. Once you've sent in your manuscript, don't be afraid to follow up with a polite email or call to inquire about the status of your submission.Be patient: Getting published takes time and persistence. Rejection is a common part of the process and doesn't mean that your book is bad. Keep working on your craft, keep submitting your manuscript and keep writing. While these are the general steps to becoming a published novelist, it is worth to mention that the path to becoming a published author and even more a successful one, can vary greatly depending on the specific book, the author's writing style, the available opportunities and the current market trends. It is always good to be flexible and open to different opportunities. Getting started with self-publishing can be a bit difficult but doesn’t have to be. After publishing 200+ books on Amazon and running 120 million Amazon ads, I discovered the secret to getting books self-published easily and selling. The key is to break down the steps into easy-to-follow bite-sized chunks as I lay out in my free self-publishing secrets checklist."},{"prompt":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute?

Avoid noisy or crowded places that could make it difficult to talk.Dress appropriately: Choose an outfit that makes you feel comfortable and confident, but also appropriate for the location and activity. You want to make a good impression, but also feel comfortable and relaxed.Be on time: Show up on time or a few minutes early. Being late can create a negative first impression and add unnecessary stress to the date.Be yourself: Be genuine and authentic, and avoid trying to impress your date with false information or exaggerations. You want to build a relationship based on honesty and trust.Be a good listener: Show interest in your date by actively listening to what they have to say and asking follow-up questions. This can help you build a connection and make your date feel heard and valued.Avoid controversial topics: Avoid controversial or sensitive topics such as politics, religion, or ex-partners. These topics can create unnecessary tension and potentially ruin the date.Keep it light and fun: Focus on having a good time and creating a fun, positive experience for both of you.

What is gravitation really? We still don’t know. Gamow was disappointed (around 1960) that scientists did not pay attention at this mysterious force. Today we find more than 8000 theories about this subject. Thousands of scientists, laymen, dissidents and crackpots spend a lot of time on gravitation. They all think that there is something about gravitation that must be cleared by some new explanation. At this moment there is no theory that is broadly accepted as scientific valuable. In spite of all precise measuring and formulas gravitation is still a remarkable physic phenomenon. Gravitation is a phenomenon that we all know too well: all our actions have been based on that force. So just because of our familiarity with this force we have the risk to “stand on it” not really knowing on what force we stand. When we observe the world around us, we do this using our senses in connection with our brain which leads to our awareness and our consciousness in space and time. This consciousness has always been bound by nature (biological and neurological) to each individual person. That consciousness is always in the middle of the surrounding world and has been used to orientate ourselves: where are we, who are we. So in earlier days everybody knew that the sun is going to come up and turn around through the sky; this was an ordinary experience for each individual; everyone observed that the sun rises up and goes down. When a broadly accepted idea was thrown away by various discoveries and calculations then it takes some time before this [LINKED_TEXT: new interpretation is accepted] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIy76M-4txo] (Galaxy song). I think that there must be a good reason that gives a logical explanation WHY we still are in confusion about gravity. I think our confusion is CAUSED by our consciousness: being a part of the physic world in a manner as people on a floating island don’t realize that they are floating. So I have a proposal that is related to the sub questions above. I think we need a team of cooperating scientist of very different sciences as physics, neuropsychology, geology, archaeology, cosmology, quantum physics, chemists, social sciences, (epi)genetics, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and technic engineering. Probably we need some elements of different theories to put together. Some parts to combine, some parts to throw away, some parts to change. There must be something that we did overlook until now. It would be a great step if some university would form a “Task Force Gravitation” to clear this basic question of physics and life. That could give a new approach, a new motivation and replace hope in solution."},{"prompt":"What is a proxy, and how can I use one?","completion":"I’ll try to be short with this answer: A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse. Proxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy. If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you. Modern proxy servers do much more than forwarding web requests, all in the name of data security and network performance. Proxy servers act as a firewall and web filter, provide shared network connections, and cache data to speed up common requests. A good proxy server keeps users and the internal network protected from the bad stuff that lives out in the wild internet. Lastly, proxy servers can provide a high level of privacy.

This article will serve as your compass, leading you through the exciting trip of investing and trading, whether you're a seasoned Wall Street enthusiast or an inquisitive novice ready to dip your toes in the financial water. Chapter 1: Laying the Foundation - Investing vs. Trading Before we dive headfirst into the action, let's distinguish between investing and trading. Investing is akin to planting seeds, patiently nurturing them as they grow into mighty oaks, providing bountiful fruits over time. On the other hand, trading is akin to dancing on the waves, quick and nimble, taking advantage of short-term price movements. Both avenues offer unique opportunities, and it's essential to understand your goals and risk tolerance before you embark on your financial voyage. Chapter 2: The Stock Market - Your Personal Playground Welcome to the stock market's playground of possibilities! Dreams of wealth and success come true here. Investing in stocks entails becoming a part owner of a firm, and trading them is all about timing your buys and sells. It's similar to riding a roller coaster, and while there are ups and downs, the exhilaration is palpable. Chapter 3: Success Techniques: The Art of the Deal Ah, the alluring world of investment strategies! Whether you're a cautious tortoise or a daring hare, there's a strategy that suits your style.

It's like pitting art against science, yet both are indispensable in the world of investing and trading. Fundamental analysis delves into a company's financial health, while technical analysis reads the patterns on the price charts. Mastering both arts will elevate your trading game to legendary status. Chapter 6: Taming the Wild Bull and Bear - Risk Management Just like herding wild animals, managing risk in the market is crucial. The mighty bull and the ferocious bear often dictate the market's direction, and without proper risk management, you may find yourself in a precarious position.

I will warn u when u get to that point Nana Shimura (志し村むら菜な奈な) the mother of Kotaro Shimura, Father of Tenko Shimura also known as Tomura Shigaraki. In other words, she is the grandmother of Shigaraki. Ironically, Nana (七) is the Japanese word for \\"seven\\", her being the seventh One For All user. Nana is also a common nickname for a grandmother in many languages, referencing to her being Tomura Shigaraki literal grandmother. Why is she the strongest mother in my hero academia. Well she is the only mother we know that was a pro hero. and as for strength, Quirk One For All: Transferred to her from the sixth user, Nana's second Quirk allowed her to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing her to significantly enhance all of her physical abilities to a superhuman level. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, agility, and durability. Float: Nana's Quirk granted her the ability to suspend herself in mid-air. It is currently unknown if she was able to maneuver herself while levitating. Trained Muscles: Usage of One For All requires the user to have strong muscles, as One For All is a lot to handle and could cause the users body to be blown apart if they don't possess the necessary strength of body. Nana's signature smile. Nana was a kind woman with a strong sense of justice. She believed that a true hero should smile, no matter how grim the situation. Furthermore, she was a loving mother to her son before she died at the hands of All For One, and was shown to be compassionate, nurturing, and supportive of him. Spoiler //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Spoiler Except for the fact that she gives up on her son(which is how the League of Villains was created (not really) ) After his mother gave him up, Kotaro developed a deep hatred towards his mother, feeling as though she abandoned him for the sake of strangers. This eventually grew into a hatred for all heroes, viewing them as selfish people whose actions only served to harm their own families. As a result of this hatred, he showed open disdain for anything hero related and became both physically and emotionally abusive towards his son whenever he showed interest in or even mentioned heroes around him. This is seen again when he attacked the child for finding the picture of his paternal grandmother and condemning her memory. Ironically, he started doing the very thing he believed all heroes were guilty of and instilling his son's future hatred of heroes and society. Which ended up being his last day.

The other possibility is that your biological father relinquished his parental rights or had them stripped for cause and your step-father adopted you. In that case, a new birth certificate was issued and the original was filed. Do you not have a good relationship with the father on your birth certificate?

These included being excessively happy, sitting on a beanbag, exercising too much, and asking if we had Cannellini beans. That’s not even comprehensive. Excessively Happy At my very first supervision at a unit, I was informed I was ‘too happy’. I asked for elaboration and essentially people had complained that I was too active in the mornings when they were tired. At the time, I used to walk a mile to work listening to Sabaton, and after the first 30 minutes, I would have to do 2 exercise routines with my clients. I thought it was rather understandable that I would be high energy. I’m still bewildered about it to be honest because it wasn’t as if I was really talking to my colleagues except for two I consider friends. Sitting On A Bean Bag In the lounge area of our unit, we had a small black bean bag. No one ever used it, but when my colleagues would start gossiping about people (something I was very uncomfortable with) I’d take it and sit elsewhere to do my work. Apparently, someone reported me for sitting on it. So I had to be spoken to super seriously about sitting on a beanbag. No one could explain why it was wrong, so instead, they cut up the bean bag. Not Interrupting A Client… uh… well So when I was still green I worked with a non-verbal client. I’d make their food and knock on their bedroom door and open it enough to show them the food so they’d know it was lunchtime. On one occasion I opened the door to find them masturbating. So, not to embarrass them I quickly closed it and put the lunch back in the kitchen. We had a logbook where you report why you don’t do things on time etc. I wrote a quick note “X’s lunch is late, they’re masturbating and I don’t want to disturb them, will try again in 15 minutes”. Two managers showed up to interrogate me, a mass text was sent out about not using the word ‘masturbating’. I was reduced to tears by two squawking harpies and then paraded in front of the unit before I was allowed to go home. It was incredibly bizarre and I ended up leaving that specific unit because of the ordeal. Exercising too much At the start of the pandemic, everything closed. This meant a lot of the gyms and stuff my clients liked to do were not available. So I made a point of organising long walks, nature trails, things to appeal to them. I even downloaded the INaturalist app and had some of the guys who liked plants and animals in order to help take pictures and count them for the app. Apparently, I got reported for ‘hogging the time outside the unit’ because other people would like to go outside. In my off time, I mainly play video games and read, I don’t know why people didn’t think they could just volunteer to go out with the guys themselves. I honestly would have enjoyed the extra time to do my paperwork and sit around drinking tea. Asking if we had Cannellini Beans This one only happened a short time ago. I was supporting one of my clients to make dinner and she wanted to make Chilli Con Carne. To her dismay, she found there were no kidney beans. I was like “hey that’s okay, are there Cannellini beans?”My manager who walked in was like “There are baked beans” It honestly hadn’t occurred to me that baked beans could go in a chilli con Carne because they are sweet so I said.Me: “Oh, we’re looking for beans for her Chilli Con Carne” To which my manager proceeded to get completely irate and told me to use the baked beans. I found some kidney beans fortunately so disaster averted. Apparently, my manager gossiped about it so hard that even my colleague got sick of hearing about it and began to mock her behind her back for not knowing what Cannellini beans are.

I turned around on her and approached the car. She was so nervous she was shaking. I requested the usual…Driver’s License, Registration and Insurance and as she was retrieving the documents I realized that I recognized her. She was the young waitress who usually served me coffee and breakfast at a local restaurant. So anyway, as she hands me the license I noticed there was a paper clip attached to it. Now, many of us have had this before and it was most often a 50 or 100 bill used as a bribe to get out of the ticket so I asked her, “Are you sure you want to hand this drivers license to me as is?” She looked confused. I repeated my question and warned her that if there was money clipped to the DL she would be arrested for attempted bribery. Through very teary eyes she looked confused but assured me that, “Yes, this is my driver’s license.” My heart sank to my stomach because I liked this kid and did not want to arrest her. I walked back to my patrol car and reviewed the proof of insurance and registration. With a grimace on my face and some hesitation I turned the DL over to its back side and found a “Get out of Jail Free” card from Community Chest of the game Monopoly.

Here are some common practices: Recycling and reprocessing: Many hotels partner with soap recycling organizations or initiatives that collect used soap bars. These organizations sanitize and reprocess the soap to create new bars for needy people. This process helps reduce waste and provides hygiene products to communities that may not have easy access.Donations: Some hotels donate their used soap to local charities, homeless shelters, or organizations that support those in need. These organizations can distribute the soap to individuals and communities who benefit from it.Hygiene kits: Hotels may repurpose partially used soap bars by creating hygiene kits. These kits can include soap, shampoo, conditioner, and other toiletries and are often donated to charitable organizations or disaster relief efforts.Employee use or sale: Sometimes, hotels allow their staff members to use partially used or unopened soap bars. This helps minimize waste and ensures that the products are put to use. Alternatively, hotels may offer these products for sale in gift shops or online platforms, allowing guests to purchase them.Environmentally friendly disposal: In cases where recycling or donation is not feasible, hotels may dispose of the used soap in an environmentally friendly manner. This can involve proper waste management procedures, such as sending it to appropriate recycling or waste treatment facilities. It's worth noting that specific practices may vary depending on the hotel's policies, location, and partnerships with recycling or charitable organizations. However, many hotels strive to minimize waste and make socially and environmentally conscious choices regarding the management of used soap. So, the next time you stay at a hotel, know that the soap you use might just be on its way to a new life, positively impacting people and the planet!

In a nutshell, string theory, or the more general form, M theory, posits that everything in the universe can be built up from tiny strings that vibrate. It requires 11 dimensions, 7 more than the relativistic model of 4, three spacial and one time. The remaining dimensions are so tightly coiled that we cannot observe them. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum and relativity theory. There are several problems. M theory was developed as a generalization of earlier theory, because there were multiple possible ways to describe the multiple dimensions. Furthermore, there is at yet no experimental verification of string theory on the large scale, and it may be impossible to find such verification, which is an enormous problem. Smolin makes the case that string theory has crowded out other possible lines of investigation in the central problem—unifying quantum theory and relativity theory. There is a certain elegance to string and M theory—but unless it can be verified experimentally, it can only be regarded as highly tentative. Physics as a discipline is in a very interesting state right now. It is taking longer and longer to solve fundamental theoretical problems. The Higgs field, for instance, was initially posited over 50 years ago, but there was no experimental verification until 2012. The bridge between the macroscopic world and the quantum world—the collapse of the wave function—still relies on the Copenhagen interpretation, which is very unsatisfying. It will be more interesting to see what happens in coming years. It may well be that we need a theoretical breakthrough comparable to relativity and quantum theory, both of which are 100 years ago—and I doubt if string theory is the answer."},{"prompt":"What is the real meaning of friendship?","completion":"A close relationship between two or more individuals that is marked by trust, caring, respect, support, and affection is referred to as friendship. It is a connection that develops over time when people share common experiences, feelings, and interests. Friendship is fundamentally about having a strong sense of empathy and caring for the other person. Friends sincerely care about one another's happiness, prosperity, and personal development, according to this statement. They support one another emotionally, encourage one another when things are tough, and commemorate one another's victories and significant anniversaries. Mutual regard, trust, and honesty are other important components of friendship. Friends can talk to one another honestly and openly without worrying about being judged or rejected. They are trustworthy and dependable, and you can rely on them to keep their word and uphold secrecy when it's required. In conclusion, true friendship is a bond that develops between people who have a strong bond based on shared trust, care, respect, support, and affection, and who genuinely want the best for one another."},{"prompt":"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?","completion":"If we could use 100% of our brain, we would be able to do things like reading people's thoughts, controlling the weather, and moving objects with our minds.

This refers to a company changing its strategy or direction in response to market conditions or new opportunities. This maneuver can be particularly effective when a company is struggling, as it allows them to find new sources of revenue and revitalize their business. An example of this is Netflix, which started as a DVD-by-mail rental service in 1997, but as the streaming technology evolved and the internet improved, Netflix saw an opportunity and decided to pivot to streaming video in 2007. This allowed them to take advantage of the growing trend of online streaming and eventually become one of the largest streaming services in the world. The pivot allowed Netflix to stay relevant in an industry that was rapidly changing and ultimately helped the company to thrive. Another example is the company, Apple, which was initially known for its personal computers in the 1980s and early 1990s, but then shifted its focus to portable music players with the launch of the iPod in 2001, and then smartphones with the launch of the iPhone in 2007. These product launches not only helped Apple to stay relevant but also helped it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. In both these examples, the companies were able to identify new market opportunities and shift their strategies accordingly. This allowed them to stay ahead of the competition and grow their business, proving that a well-executed pivot can be a shrewd and smart maneuver in business. In summary, the ability to pivot one's business model can be a shrewd and smart maneuver in business. It allows a company to take advantage of new market opportunities and stay relevant in an ever-changing business landscape. It's important to be open to new opportunities and adapt to changing market conditions in order to be successful in business."},{"prompt":"Can you use a mouse with a smart TV?","completion":"Well, I just tried it out - a Logitech wireless mouse, with a Samsung smart TV (one of the older models), and to my great surprise it actually worked! It worked so well that I am seriously considering buying a mouse to go with the TV. Normally, when you move the on-screen pointer using the arrow keys on the remote control, it has 2 modes. In one mode the pointer jumps from link to link, which is reasonably fast - but it doesn’t work on things like buttons. In the other mode, you can move the pointer anywhere, as you would with a mouse, and it works on buttons, but it is SLOW-W-W. When I connect a mouse, however, I can move the pointer anywhere at a reasonable speed.

It is a source of relief and comfort. If you are planning to buy a new [LINKED_TEXT: mattress] [URL: https://holdermattress.com/], take the time to read up on several important things you should know before buying one. 1. Primarily focus on comfort because even if you buy the most expensive mattress, you won’t have the best sleeping experience of your life if you’re not comfortable on it. 2. Perfect Mattress size is required because If you feel restricted by a narrow bed, then you need a more spacious double bed. A queen size may be a bit large for an individual person, but it’s great if you like the extra space. King-sized or California king mattresses are made for partners and for master bedrooms and offer plenty of space for couples. 3. Test the mattress first and then buy. Most of the shopkeepers will let you sleep and test the mattress which will help you get the exact experience of the sleep on that mattress. 4. Read the online reviews before buying because this gives you a more practical idea of the popular mattresses currently available and allows you to narrow down the huge field of choices. 5. Do not select the most soft ones because too much softness will sag under the middle area of the spine, which can cause poor posture and lead to back pain. 6. An adjustable air bed is a safe but expensive option. Since you can adjust the firmness and softness with a remote, you’re safer even without first testing the mattress. 7. Decide on a budget and stick to it as, the prices of mattresses vary greatly, so you need to set a price you are willing to pay and not go over that amount.

Problems: They only buy their IP’s and then doing nothing with them. They have all these amazing studios and have done nothing. They’re sitting on Conker and Banjoo-Kazooi, but won’t make any games based off those IP’s and anything else Microsoft has done with RARE has been lackluster at best. Everyone was concerned that aquiring Activision was going to be the death of PlayStation. When ironically Nintendo’s managed to survive this era without CoD. I was concerned I’d never see another Spyro game.Kinda ties in with 1. Instead of making their own IP’s they buy them instead of creating their own image and personality. PlayStation has it’s own identity of what makes a PlayStation game. Nintendo has their own identity of what makes a Nintendo game. Microsoft doesn’t. They did in the 360 days, but now nothing.They don’t have any games too call their own or any of real interest. Too me at least. “We have Halo” okay, I don’t like shooters. What else do they got? “Um Gears Of War” okay that’s just Halo in third person. What else. “Forza….” you don’t have anything do you? “No.” Everything else has failed, or you can get on a platform you more than likely already care about even ignoring the PC. love Ori? Don’t need an Xbox to play it. I was interested in Cuphead. But I don’t need an Xbox to play it. I appreciate having games on a platform I already care about but then you might as well go third party by that point instead of wasting peoples money.“We have Game Pass and Backwards Compatibility” great. Those are cool extras though. Not a good reason to buy a console. Now that I beat Sonic Unleashed, I don’t even care about my Xbox anymore, if I wanna replay Sonic Unleashed about it I’ll just tolerate the problems it had on PS3. Sure it’s the worst version but at least I’m playing it on a platform that I genuinely care about. If Xbox would get their heads in the game and actually develop games people want then less PlayStation fans or even Nintendo fans would hate the Xbox. I wanna be an Xbox fan, I just love gaming but Xbox doesn’t have any. They give you barely any reason to give a care about it, and I’m convinced Microsoft doesn’t care anymore either. I love the underdog, I loved my Wii U, and I didn’t even really care about the games on PlayStation until Spider-Man came out. How can you expect me to care about Xbox when it feels like Xbox doesn’t care about Xbox? Here’s my nitpicks of why I don’t like Xbox. Again these are just my personal opinion and I fully admit it’s just my problem. Trophies sound cooler than Achievments.twin-stick is better than offset. I will die on that hill.

Xbox ONE, Xbox ONE S, Xbox ONE X? Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S? Is Xbox trying to confuse people? Sure PlayStation isn’t creative but at least it’s kind of hard to get confused. Sure Nintendo has creative names but with the exception of the Wii U, it’s easy to understand which Nintendo console you’re looking for.

It's critical to communicate with your advisor throughout the dissertation writing process, and this will assist you in identifying typical errors and viewing the text from a different perspective. 4. Don't ask your friends how much they've completed: this will obstruct your progress because you'll be thinking about their papers and comparing the outcomes. 5. Remember to sleep: Eat well, feed your brain, and avoid sleepless nights. You must remain productive, which is impossible if you do not get sufficient rest. 6. Concentrate on the work: While discipline is necessary, the most important thing is to help your brain focus on the task and prevent multitasking. 7.

The “liberals” are lying: no need for conservatives to follow their lead, and repeat their errors of understanding of the real workld data. Re- abortion - there’s a lot of it about - spontaneously. Half the ova fertilised are aborted within the first trimester - it’s God’s way of admitting that he screwed up. I am a man, and have no experience of it personally. I have a niece who lost five babies on the trot - gave up - adopted, or rather fostered five other children - then bore a daughter - now a graduate from Durham Universioty - and a lesbian - and happily hooked up with some other such. So, what do I THINK about it ? Sad. Natural abortions will continue. Artificially induced abortions - are something necessary - occasionally - in very sad cases -especially for rape victimes who do not want to bear the child of a violent unwanted other - or very young/foolish girls - children, sometimes - who have been abused or misled. I see no moral grounds for anyone to deny them such a solution to their problems, certainly not the government. “Gay Marriage” is disgusting. I do not mean that homhsexual activity is disgusting - it may be, I do not know, nor care - but forcing the Church to perform marriage ceremonies for people who choose to flout its teachings, and refuse to conform to its requireements, strikes me as a (typical) GROSS breach of the distinction between Church and State, between politicos and Theologians. I am an atheist, and do not care about the Church AT ALL - but I gave friends who are religious (most Christians, of various confessions, a few Jews and Muslims, and some “other” - orientals) and I do not approve of arrogant politicians telling these others how they should run their own houses. Gays (?) can form partnerships if they want to, on any terms they like, to provide some pecuniary stability in case of death or disease - not that there will be any dependent children to provide for - so it is hardly a matter for the Government to get involded in. They may “want” a church ceremony - but I fail to see how it can be legitimate for the government to force any church to provide the decorative background for an anti-religious legal documentation. You cannot always get what you want. As for the death penalty - sooner that than the reckless early release of ALLEGEDLY “reformed” killers.

Why you can’t get visitors You’re not going to make any money as an affiliate if you can’t get your affiliate link in front of people. And this means you need to get visitors to your website. Let me just say this first: You could get thousands of visitors to your website today, while barely lifting a finger — If you’re willing to pay some serious money for it. (And then you better hope you make a profit — it’s not as easy as it sounds!) The thing that’s hard is getting visitors to your website without paying for them, either through the search engines or social media. So why can some people do it, but other people just seem to suck at it? The big thing to understand is that if you want free visitors, it’s pretty much always going to come down to whether you can get other people to share your stuff. You need people to LINK to your website from their website, because this is what will help your website rank well in the search engines. Or you need them to tell their friends and networks about your stuff on social media, blogs, forums etc, because this is what will give your site exposure (which will lead to more visitors and more links). So you need people to share. Got that? But here are the problems I see with affiliate sites that can’t get traffic: PROBLEM #1: Your website doesn’t make sense. I don’t understand what it’s about, so I’m not going to share it. PROBLEM #2: Your content is unremarkable. It doesn’t excite me, and it’s no better than anything else out there, so I’m not going to share it. PROBLEM #3: You’re trying to rank for topics/keywords that are just too competitive. There are already loads of website out there that are doing it way better than you, and those guys are already at the top. If I’m looking for an article to share, I’m gonna pick one of those other guys. I’m not going to share yours. Back in the old days, none of this mattered. You could just go out there and build a bunch of links to your own websites, and you’d be able to rise up the search engine rankings. But since Google’s Penguin came along, you need to go out and convince real people that your content is worth linking to. And guess what? Real people don’t want to link to crappy websites or crappy content. And who’s really good at building crappy websites? Affiliates. Because we’re not building them out of love. We're in it for the money. And it shows. So that’s the (very simplified) reason why you can’t get traffic. Basically, because your website and content aren’t very good, or because you’re going after keywords that are too competitive (AND your content isn't very good.) If you’re prepared to do a little bit more than the bare minimum, it actually becomes quite easy to make good money. How do you build content that doesn’t suck?

(Sometimes you just need to make a couple of quick tweaks, and other times it might be because you got things wrong from the very beginning.) ISSUE #1: You’re promoting products that don’t sell If you don’t choose the right products to promote, then no matter how great your website is… you’re going to have trouble selling them. You might have chosen products that just don’t sell well. Or you might be promoting great products, but you’re promoting them to the wrong people. Either way, you’re going to have a hard time making money. ISSUE #2: You’re not funnelling people towards a sale Just because you get someone to your site, it doesn’t mean they’re automatically going to want to buy something. The best affiliate sites are ones that effectively move their visitors closer to a sale through different kinds of content and subtle psychological tricks. Marketers like to call this a “funnel”, and that’s really what an affiliate site is — it’s a big funnel. Every page on your website should be leading your visitors towards a sale. (But that doesn’t just mean slapping a big link or a banner in the middle of the page. Some of the best funnels are ones where your visitor can’t even tell you’re trying to sell them something.) ISSUE #3: You’re targeting the wrong people If you’re only attracting the kind of visitors who are never going to buy anything… you’re probably not going to make many sales. A lot of times, affiliates focus too much on getting traffic, but don’t pay enough attention to whether that traffic will buy. Newsflash: Not all traffic is equal. Some kinds of traffic is much more likely to buy than other kinds. So if you’re focusing on the wrong kind… you’ll get lots of visitors, but still no money. The 4 steps to success as an affiliate #1: Choose the right products and niche to promote. Find products and niches that are going to perform well. #2: Target the right people — the ones who will buy. Target them with the right choice of keywords, and the right kind of content. #3: Build a solid funnel that moves people towards a sale. Say the right thing at the right time to build their interest in a product. #4: (And if you want free traffic) Create a website that people will want to share. Build content that gives people what they want, and the job of promoting your website becomes ridiculously easy. Learn how to build a website that ticks all of these boxes.

Apple has designed their products with ergonomics in mind, and adding a touch screen could go against their philosophy of creating products that are comfortable to use.Interface design: Apple's macOS operating system is designed for use with a mouse and keyboard, not for touch input. Adding touch screens to Macs could require significant changes to the user interface and user experience.Precision: Touch screens can be less precise than a mouse or trackpad, which can make it difficult to perform certain tasks that require a high degree of accuracy, such as photo or video editing.Cost: Adding touch screens to Macs would increase the cost of production, which would likely result in higher prices for consumers. However, it's worth noting that Apple has not ruled out the possibility of adding touch screens to Macs in the future. The company has been experimenting with touch input on its iPads and has even introduced touch bar technology on some of its MacBook Pro models. It remains to be seen if touch screens will eventually make their way into the Mac lineup."},{"prompt":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","completion":"I can’t claim to having been either a very creative disciplinarian or even an especially good one, having yelled in frustration at my kids numerous times. With my grandchildren it’s easier since I’m not around them a lot. It’s important to remember that young children are extremely self-centered; this is normal. You must ask yourself what is the most desirable way to get your children to behave more or less as you wish. Ask yourself this when you are in a rational state, not when your kids have driven you to the point of exploding. In other words, think about how you will handle a similar situation the next time it occurs. Here’s an example; my young grandkids become very frustrated when they lose at games. It is not desirable to always let them win. The last time this happened with me I pointed out to the loser that he doesn’t really lose when someone else wins the game, because when the other person wins, it makes that person happy, and makes you more likely to be valued as his friend. Having friends is more important than winning all the time. I added that it wasn’t necessary to lose all or even most of the time, but winning should be shared among friends."},{"prompt":"What is the best Bollywood song for caller tune?","completion":"Best song for caller tune, as per my choice, is, “Pukarta chala hoon mein, gali gali bahaar ki, bus ek chhaon zulf ki, bus ik nigah hai pyar ki” from the Bollywood movie “Mere Sanam” (1965) sung by Mohd.

The unconscious mind exists below our conscious awareness. This is why we can’t directly control our unconscious mind. It takes a little more effort to be able to grow as a person using your unconscious mind. But, the unconscious mind can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and behaviors. By influencing your unconscious mind you can understand your motivations and your behaviors. Constant Self-Reflection and Mindfulness Regularly engage in self-reflection or mindfulness practices. Meditating, journaling, or simply taking time to observe your thoughts and emotions can help you become more aware of your unconscious patterns and triggers. The key to these practices is patience and consistency. You must also realize that you won’t see effects immediately, but that changes happen gradually. I have found that if you just jump into meditating or journaling you won’t get very far. You need to tweak your environment to remove distractions. You need to go into every session with the purpose of discovering yourself. Most importantly, you need to be accountable for yourself. 10 mins five times a week is way better than 2 hrs every other Sunday. Over time, these practices can help you become more self-aware, reduce stress, and cultivate a greater sense of clarity and well-being. Performing Dream Analysis Pay attention to your dreams and keep a dream journal. Dreams often contain symbolism and messages from the unconscious mind. Analyzing your dreams can provide valuable insights into your hidden emotions and thoughts. This can be a tricky thing to accomplish. When I wake I find that I usually have no recollection of what I dreamed of the night before. Although, when I do have a dream it is often the same or similar to dreams I have had in the past. And writing these dreams down provided me with valuable insight into my unconscious mind. After consistently keeping track of your dream, you may see emotions from your dreams manifest in your daily life.

When a close friend of mine received counseling he shared a lot about his past. This allowed the Counselor to gain a better understanding of how past experiences could be influencing your current behavior. By talking with a professional he was able to target the root cause of the problem and take actionable steps to fix it. Often when we are dealing with psychological problems we don’t talk about them. We fear that the people around us will treat us differently. A professional counselor or therapist is able to give us peace of mind. They also have the ability to provide us with an insight into our unconscious mind. Receiving counseling from a trained professional in psycho dynamic approaches can help with exploring your unconscious mind. Identifying Specific Triggers Identifying triggers can be very insightful into the unconscious mind. Humans are creatures of habit, and we tend to respond to similar situations in similar ways. Pay attention to identifying emotional reactions that seem out of proportion to the situation. The triggers can help you reveal underlying unconscious issues that might be influencing your response. Whenever you get yelled at you yell back. When you get bogged down with work you feel demotivated. When you listen to music you feel relaxed. Whenever you donate money you feel good about yourself. Triggers can be a variety of things. You should pay attention to them. Learn what they are and then control them. Figure out how to control the bad triggers, and find ways to express the good triggers. By controlling your emotional response to things you can begin to control your life. Regulating Your Emotions By learning to manage your emotions effectively, you can minimize the influence of unconscious emotions on your behaviors and decision-making. Start with holding the door open for a stranger. Saying thank you to the cashier. Picking up a piece of trash on the side of the road. If you want to influence your unconscious mind it will take time and effort. But, regulating your emotions is one of the easiest things that you can start doing right now. Small building blocks lay the foundation for monumental change. By repeatedly trying to influence your unconscious mind you will eventually reach your goal."},{"prompt":"Why did Kavanaugh say that Americans have a right to privacy after protestors ruined his meal at a steak house when he was part of the majority SCOTUS opinion that overturned roe on the basis that the constitution doesn't grant a right to privacy?","completion":"You are essentially using a word (“privacy”) that has different meanings depending on context and interchanging them without distinction. Roe v. Wade uses “privacy” to basically mean immunity from criminal prosecution for abortion physicians while Kavanaugh is using “privacy” in its more ordinary usage, which refer’s to one’s reasonable expectation of being left alone or to physically exclude others from private property. Your argument supporting Roe v. Wade would be analogous to a criminal defendant in court saying, “but your honor, I had a right to commit murder in my living room because I have a right to privacy there [in my own living room].” You may have a right to exclude others from your living room but your living room is still subject to the laws of the jurisdiction you live in.

People didn't live as long, and they often had to struggle to survive due to lack of food and widespread diseases. Teenagers had to grow up quickly because they had to help support their families. It was a difficult and challenging time.But now, things are much easier for teenagers. We have access to entertainment, food, and a safer environment. If we get sick, we can go to the doctor and get medicine. Plus, there's not as much pressure on us to start working and making money right away. As a teenager myself, I have to admit that life seems pretty easy nowadays. In fact, many people would argue that this is the best time to be a teenager. However, the problem is that we often take all these things for granted. We don't fully understand or appreciate the hardships that our ancestors went through, including our grandparents and fathers. We have everything at our fingertips, and we've become somewhat spoiled and ungrateful because we've been protected from the harsh realities of life.This lack of gratitude and understanding is evident in the behavior of many young people today. You see videos of my generation, Generation Z, acting foolishly and making poor choices. The reason behind this is that we don't fully grasp what life could be like. We haven't experienced the same degree of suffering and challenges that our predecessors did. As a result, we don't have the capacity to truly appreciate what we have and feel grateful for it. I must include myself in this problem. Recently, I caught myself complaining about school after a tiring day. But then I realized how ungrateful I was being. My father worked really hard to send me to college, and here I was, complaining about it. It made me realize that we take so many things for granted, like the ability to eat whatever we want whenever we want or access any form of entertainment at any time. Actually this access of any form of entertainment at any time is what making us so unhappy. We need to learn to do boring things. Boredom is often seen as something negative, but it can actually have positive effects on our well-being. When we are bored, it allows our minds to wander and explore new ideas. It gives us the opportunity to reflect, daydream, and engage in creative thinking. Boredom can be a catalyst for innovation and personal growth. Life is supposed to be difficult and gen Z don't like the idea of difficulty. Do we? We were not made for sitting hours scrolling our life away. Stop numbing yourself with social media and instant gratification. Life is so short to do such things. We can't just take a pile and runway from problems.

Apple's decision to enter the mobile phone market was a calculated move based on a deep understanding of consumer needs and behavior. By introducing a product that combined the functions of a phone, music player, camera, and internet device, Apple created a new category of product that revolutionized the industry. The iPhone's success can be attributed to several factors, including its sleek design, intuitive user interface, and ecosystem of third-party apps.

Vlad was and is loved because: (In one of our many hours of darkness) he took us unruly, uneducated, chaotic romanians and steeled us into a most formidable weapon capable of standing against the greatest empire of the time (the Ottoman one). As soon as he took power he: Formed a real, uniform army made of professional soldiers.He imposed taxes on the boyars (the local upper class) who were virtually free from taxation and eliminates the unruly ones. Taming (at least for the moment) a dangerous and vile beast standing between Wallachia and progress. He confiscates their land and gives it to the peasants, who, in exchange are to be trained (during post-harvest months) into soldiers.He removes the parrasites (thieves and bandits, beggars, vagabonds, plague afflicted people) like no one else was able before (something very cruel in our modern eyes, but a necessity as far as our survival was concerned, in those days).He centralizes the state and builds fortifications, churches (cultural and educational centers we modern people fail to appreciate often) and expands the capital.He also creates a nobility based only on meritocracy.He undertakes infrastructure construction, improving internal and international trade.He gives state subsidies to craftsmen to open buisnessesHe encourages the development of a middle-class through tax exemption.He installs custom posts at the borders, demanding that foreign merchants pay taxes. All of these turned Wallachia, from a weak and irrelevant state, into a most formidable weapon which Vlad very skillfully wielded against the Ottoman Empire which threathened to consume Wallachia and all of Christendom (a real risk at the time) almost personally killing the Sultan (who only survived because of random luck), rogue romanian lords trying to wrestle power from Vlad, saxon establishemnts which threathened the security of Wallachia defying Vlad (here is where the anti-Vlad propaganda comes from) and other internal and external threaths. On top of all these Vlad was an incredibly competent knight and commander who’s exploits make some of the more admirable characters in Game of Thrones look like amateurs. Did he do all this through the most brutal means available? Yes. Did he have a choice on this matter? Not really. Things were an extremely dire as Vlad and Wallachia itself were facing numerous threaths, many much much stronger. Was he a sadist, blood-drinking savage? No. This is all propaganda paid for by the defeated saxons who provoked Vlad. The saxons even paid for a portrait to be made, portraying Vlad like a sinister goat-man, a baphomet almost. In truth, judging from description from the time (both of Vlad and his brother), Vlad would have been a very handsome man. In the end, Vlad did at that time what us romanians need now as well. We’re mistreated by our own fiendish political class (the boyars of our days).Our society is plagued by criminals and madmen and little to no proper action is taken.We’re denied proper infrastructure and investments.We’re denied a meritocratic society.We’re bullied by larger (Russia) and smaller threaths without proper action being taken.The wealth of our nation is thrown to the thrash or squandered.Our middle-class and buisnessmen are supressed rather than nurtured. By all means, most romanians not only see Vlad as one of our national heroes but strongly desire for him to return (another Vlad) to redeem us. Personally I believe Romania will redeem itself through the long-term practice and improvement of the Rule of Law, Democracy and Human Rights and not through a Messianic leader, but many romanians passionately await for the (faster) second option."},{"prompt":"Other than cheating, what's the biggest betrayal in a relationship?","completion":"Lies!!

I’ve followed popular history of World War II all my life and never met a single American who seriously believes such a thing.

The flood of wartime movies, books, and articles praising British resolution and heroism were seemingly forgotten or dismissed as inadequate.

It is an essential part of hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to all tissues and organs in the body. But millions of individuals all around the world suffer from the common dietary disease known as iron insufficiency. In this blog, we shall examine the effects of iron deficiency and how they may affect human health. Weakness and weariness: Weakness and weariness are two of the main signs of an iron deficit. Without enough iron, the body is unable to create a sufficient number of healthy red blood cells, which reduces the quantity of oxygen delivered to the muscles and tissues. This may lead to a persistent sense of exhaustion, lower energy levels, and a reduced capacity for physical activity.Impaired Cognitive Function: Iron deficiency can also affect the health of the brain and cognitive function. For the brain to work at its best, there must be an adequate amount of oxygen. Low iron levels may prevent the brain from getting enough oxygen, which can cause cognitive issues including poor focus, a short attention span, memory issues, and diminished general cognitive function.Immune System Weakness: The immune system needs iron to operate properly. It is essential for the development of immune cells and antibodies that defend the body from illnesses and infections. Low iron levels can weaken the immune system, increase susceptibility to infections, cause recurrent illnesses, and lengthen recovery times.Iron deficiency can lead to pale skin and changes in the look of the nails and hair. Pale or \\"washed-out\\" skin might result from a reduction in red blood cell formation. Additionally, those who lack enough iron may lose their hair and have brittle, spoon-shaped nails.Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is a syndrome marked by unpleasant feelings in the legs that often begin at rest and get worse while you're sleeping. A lack of iron has been associated with the onset or exacerbation of RLS symptoms. In some people, restoring iron levels with appropriate supplementation may help with RLS symptoms.Increased Anemia Risk: If iron deficiency is left untreated, it can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. Anemia develops when the body's iron reserves are severely depleted, which causes a decline in the generation of healthy red blood cells. Extreme exhaustion, breathlessness, lightheadedness, headaches, and a fast heartbeat are all possible anemia symptoms.Children's growth and development can be affected by iron deficiency, which is especially alarming because it might harm them. Low iron levels can cause physical growth delays, poor cognitive development, and poor academic achievement. To promote children's general health and well-being, it is essential to address iron deficiency as soon as possible. Iron deficiency is a disorder that should not be disregarded, which emphasizes the need of diagnosis and treatment. It is important to contact a doctor for a correct diagnosis and treatment if you think you may have an iron deficiency or are exhibiting symptoms. A blood test can be performed by a medical practitioner to assess your iron levels and the severity of the deficit. Treatment choices might be: Iron supplements may be administered to restore the body's iron reserves in situations of mild to severe iron shortage. These dietary supplements are offered in a variety of formats, including pills, capsules, and liquids, and should be consumed as recommended by your healthcare professional.Dietary adjustments: Including items high in iron in your diet can help prevent and treat an iron deficit. Lean meats, chicken, fish, legumes, dark green leafy vegetables, fortified cereals, and nuts are all excellent sources of dietary iron. Vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, and bell peppers, can improve the absorption of iron.Treatment for Underlying Causes: A lack of iron in the diet, certain medical disorders, or excessive blood loss are only a few causes of iron deficiency. For long-term control of iron levels, the underlying reasons must be found and addressed. When it comes to preventing iron deficiency, prevention is crucial. Here are some steps you can do to prevent this: Maintain a Balanced Diet: Include a range of iron-rich foods in your diet to satisfy your daily needs. For optimum absorption, incorporate sources of both heme (found in meals derived from animals) and non-heme (found in foods derived from plants).Boost Iron Absorption: Combining iron-rich meals with vitamin C sources can boost iron absorption. Take a glass of orange juice and pair it with your iron-fortified cereal, or sprinkle lemon juice over your spinach salad.Beware of Iron Blockers: Some foods and substances might prevent the absorption of iron. Caffeine-containing foods and supplements, as well as tea and coffee, should not be consumed with meals high in iron since they may prevent the absorption of iron.Consider Iron Supplements: Talk to your healthcare practitioner about the potential need for iron supplements if you are at risk for iron deficiency or have higher iron requirements (such as during pregnancy). Human health may be significantly impacted by iron deficiency, including implications for immunity, energy levels, cognitive function, and general well-being. For problems to be avoided and iron levels to be restored, prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment are essential. We may prevent iron deficiency and preserve good health by eating a balanced diet, taking iron supplements as needed, and addressing root problems. Keep in mind that the greatest source for advice and tailored suggestions to properly treat iron deficiency is your healthcare professional. Put your health first and take preventive measures to make sure your body has the iron it requires for maximum performance. 👍 Please upvote if you find it helpful.

Do they just deny the facts?","completion":"Your use of the term “gun fanatics” is pejorative, and is a logical fallacy known as an ad hominin attack, and invalidates your weak argument. Studies can be biased. But the facts of history prove any such studies wrong. Over 100 million people have been murdered by countries that took guns out of the hands of their citizens first. This occurred in various countries over the course of the last 100 years. This fact far outweighs cherry-picked selective studies by gun control advocates with an axe to grind. If you trust studies sponsored by the US Government, how about the one funded by the CDC that concluded that somewhere between 500,000 to 3,000,000 crimes are prevented annually by individuals with guns. Such incidents are virtually impossible to accurately estimate, because many such encounters go unreported because people who use guns in self defence are often subjected to ruinous prosecution by leftist prosecutors. Kyle Rittenhouse is just one example. Many legitimate cases of self defense with a gun are prosecuted for the “crime” of brandishing, which laws are often written without an explicit exception for a legitimate self defense situation. Thus, if you draw your gun, but don’t shoot the person attacking or threatening you, you risk a criminal charge. That’s wrong, but it’s the sad reality. The fact is, gun owners provide something akin to “herd immunity” which helps deter crime in society at large. Criminals never know when they might encounter an armed intended victim, and that deters much crime. Look at Chicago and other high crime regions in the country. They strongly tend to be areas with stringent gun control laws. Gun control advocates consistently ignore this reality. There are some states that allow teachers to be armed in public schools. Such a school has never had a mass shooting."},{"prompt":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","completion":"Until he’d lost the weight he’d gained over the winter, my brother ate one meal a day, his evening meal.

Or maybe the Dream Team. But seriously... I think it’s hard to argue with Richard Ludlow’s answer (The Phoenix Suns) as “the most consistently successful NBA franchise never to have won a championship.” I’m going to interpret the question (“the greatest team never to have won a championship”) a little differently. Let’s break it down.Greatest – To me, “great” means a lot more than successful. A 50-win season and a conference semifinals loss ain’t bad, but no one’s going to talk about your team 20 years later (possible exception for a team with remarkable aesthetics, like the mid-2000s Suns). “Great” means that with a break or two, or just better historical timing, the team could have won a championship and maybe more than one. It means at least a hard-fought conference finals loss in the playoffs. A dominant regular season with an early playoff exit is less impressive to me than a strong playoff run (e.g., the 1st-place, 60+win Sonics and Mavs teams who were upset in the 1st round get some credit for the regular season, but I’d rank the 50+ win Finals teams like the ’92 Blazers ahead of them).Team – Not the same as “franchise.” We may root for laundry, but I’m going to define team as a 10-year run with some consistency in personnel. The Paul Westphal/Alvan Adams/Gar Heard Suns of ’76 didn’t have much in common with the Barkley/Johnson Suns of ’92 or the Nash/Stoudemire Suns, other than an aversion to the phrase “but it’s a dry heat.”Never to have won a championship -- I don’t think Clyde Drexler consoled himself for his Finals losses by thinking, “At least Bill Walton won a ring in Portland.” I don’t think it cheered up Gary Payton when Jack Sikma and Gus Williams came back for old-timers’ day in Seattle. And I don’t know if anyone on the ’02 Kings had any idea that the Rochester Royals (same franchise) won the 1951 title. So I’ll define “never won” as “no player during the 10-year span ever won a championship with the franchise.” This rules out the West/Baylor Lakers, because West finally won in ’72, leaving Baylor to win a lot of debates as the best player without a ring. And “never to have won” means we’re looking for more than 1 year of greatness, and aren’t interested at all in teams like the ’87 Celtics who won titles with similar personnel. Loosely based on these criteria, the top possibilities I see are: Jazz 1988-1998Stockton, Malone, Hornacek rubbing his face before free throws, Mark Eaton’s beard, Greg Ostertag’s teeth. 2 Finals (both 6 games to the late-Jordan Bulls), 3 Conf Finals. 3 60-win seasons. Knicks 1991-2001Ewing, Ewing’s bum knees, Oakley, Mason, Starks, Houston, Sprewell. 2 Finals (5 and 7 games), 2 Conf Finals, several classic Conf Semifinals losses (7 games vs. Bulls, Pacers, Heat). Arguably the best and most memorable playoff team and worst regular-season team on this list. Blazers 1989-1999Drexler, Kersey, Williams, Porter, Duckworth. 2 Finals (5 and 6 games), 2 Conf Finals losses (though the 2nd one was with totally different personnel), playoffs every year. Phoenix 1988-1998KJ, Hornacek, Chambers, Majerle, a few years of vintage Barkley, the immortal Oliver Miller… this stretch was almost as fun as Nash’s run, and more successful. 1 6-game Finals vs. Jordan-prime Bulls, 2 Conference Finals, playoffs every year. Only one 60+ win season (the ’93 Finals trip). Dallas 2000-2010Nowitzki and a rotating cast of characters. 1 Finals (6 games, best case among these teams for “we wuz robbed”), 1 Conf Finals. 50+ wins every year (3 60+) but 4 1st-round exits. [Edit: disqualified for winning the 2011 title :) ] Not shocking that 4 teams are from the 90’s, when the Bulls won 6 titles and locked out a number of excellent teams. The only other decade with a similar run of dominance was the 1960s (Celtics), but as mentioned the bridesmaid Lakers eventually squeezed one in. The other team with multiple Finals losses in the 60s was the Warriors, but they had some terrible years and Rick Barry was still around for the '75 championship. While I never particularly enjoyed watching the Jazz, if I had to pick one team from above it would probably be them. In particular, they’re the team that I feel could most easily have won a title with slightly better luck and timing. If Eaton’s prime had been later, they might have made it past Hakeem in the Jordan retirement years. If Stockton and Malone had peaked a little later, they could easily have pulled out the ’99 lockout title. The Knicks were certainly memorable but never felt like a great team, and their two Finals runs were dramatic but also quirky, coinciding with Jordan’s baseball interlude and the ’99 lockout. The Blazers’ peak was shorter, they got crushed by the Pistons in the Finals, and they never beat the Lakers and benefited from Magic’s retirement. Dallas has been too much a regular-season phenomenon, and Phoenix had a nice one-year peak surrounded by a whole lot of fun/pretty good teams."},{"prompt":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","completion":"My childhood."},{"prompt":"Which is the affordable bulk SMS marketing service provider in Bangalore?","completion":"Top 10 Bulk SMS Service Providers In Bangalore There are several Bulk SMS Service providers in Bangalore that can help you send SMS messages in bulk to a large number of people.

Most Americans do not think the USA won World War II on its own. They think John Wayne won World War II on his own. I’m only partially kidding. In the US, kids in elementary school get minimal exposure to any history. It usually amounts to learning about the Pilgrims around Thanksgiving, the Civil Rights Movement in February, which is Black History Month, and small snippets of history throughout the year. Most High Schools in the US require only one year of American History and one year of World History, which in most school districts is misnamed. It should be called Western Civilization because they almost never mention anything that happened east of Suez. Most history teachers spend way too much time on the lead-up to the Revolution and the Civil War. Even then, they focus mostly on events and dates, and not many actually try to tell the story. Without the story, history is mind-numbingly dull. The best a history teacher can hope for is to spark an interest in some of their students so they will read and explore more on their own. Unfortunately, most students never pick up a history book after graduation. In the vacuum, most Americans' view of World War II has come from movies, and most of the movies they see are from the American point of view. This leads some to minimize the contributions of the other allies and think the Americans were the only ones who did anything during the war."},{"prompt":"What is the best thing I can do before I die?","completion":"‘’Not regret anythnig??’’"},{"prompt":"Why are there different systems of money transfer like RTGS, NEFT and IMPS?","completion":"Difference between NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS Fund transfers through the NEFT system do not occur on a real-time basis whereas, in RTGS and IMPS, it happens on a real-time basis.IMPS is not a time-bound service and it is possible to transfer money using IMPS 24 * 7 including public holidays and weekends, whereas NEFT and RTGS are not 24 * 7 service.The maximum transaction limit for IMPS is ₹2,00,000 but there is no maximum limit for the RTGS or NEFT (No upper ceiling for RTGS transactions through Branch, however, for the internet banking or mobile banking the maximum amount of funds that can be transferred per Customer ID per day is Rs. 25 Lakh).Minimum transaction limit should be ₹2,00,000 for RTGS, whereas ₹1 could be sent using the NEFT or IMPS.The RTGS system is suited for low-volume, high-value transactions.

Or you can pick a more niche topic where you can provide domain knowledge such that it’s easier to convert your traffic to money. The downside of this approach is that you’re getting less CPC for your ads clicked, and your market is smaller. So how much you earn depends on the tradeoff of: How much market size do you want to target vs. how much money do you want to earn per customer?

Find the person who told you that people in China are getting payment chips implanted in their bodies and ask them to explain why, in small words, with plenty of detail, why on earth anyone would pwant to put that chip inside their body, where it might get rejected, where you can’t fix it if it breaks, where it has no battery to run it…why would you do this, when everyone already carries a payment chip anyway? I mean, c’mon. This is flat-earth-level dumb. Just like the flerfers can’t explain why every government, every scientist, every sailor, and every pilot on earth are all working together to hide the shape of the planet, payment-chip-implant nutbars can’t ever seem to explain why someone would want to implant a payment microchip."},{"prompt":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"With how hard it is being an undocumented immigrant, why not just give them citizenship?","completion":"The issue of undocumented immigration is complex and controversial, and there are a variety of opinions on how best to address it. While some argue for granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants, others believe that doing so would encourage more illegal immigration and would be unfair to those who have gone through the legal process to obtain citizenship. There are several reasons why it can be difficult for undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status. In some cases, they may have entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas, which can make it difficult or impossible to obtain legal status. Additionally, the process of obtaining legal status can be time-consuming, expensive, and complicated, and there may be limited options available for certain individuals or groups. However, granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of a variety of factors, including the economic impact on the country, the impact on existing citizens and legal residents, and the legal and ethical implications of such a policy. It's also worth noting that any policy changes related to undocumented immigration would need to be made through the legislative process, which can be slow and contentious. Ultimately, the question of whether or not to grant citizenship to undocumented immigrants is a matter of political debate, and different people and groups will have different opinions on the matter. It's important to approach this issue with compassion and empathy for all those affected, and to work towards finding solutions that are fair, just, and compassionate."},{"prompt":"Can you tame an older feral cat?","completion":"FINAL UPDATE: I LOST MY SWEET BOY ON JULY 17th. It would totally depend on the cat. Here’s my beautiful story: 7–8 year old feral tom cat - neighborhood bully - decided to sleep in my covered patio. He bolted whenever he saw me. I decided to start feeding him, named him Big Joe, and talked to him all the time, using his name. As the months progressed, he would let me get closer and closer. October (month 6) came and it got cold. I bought him a heated cat house & heated bowls. One day, he let me touch him while he was eating and within 10 minutes, he rolled over on his back so I could rub his belly! I had him neutered and he’s been an indoor cat for over four years. He has the most gentle soul of any cat I’ve owned. He has never sprayed, hissed, bitten or clawed me or the other cats. If I do something he doesn’t like, he just puts his paw on my arm. Boy do I love this big old battered fella! UPDATE: WOW! Over 2500 upvotes! Big Joe is very happy that you all like his story - he’s the one who asked me to write it! 11/11/20: My sweet boy has cancer of the nose and is on steroids. Because he is FIV+ we have to keep the dosage down as it lowers the immune system which is already low due to the FIV. He’s still doing well, but my heart is heavy. 5/6/21 UPDATE: Joe’s cancer has spread on his nose and has difficulty breathing through the one nostril. He’s still eating well, but I don’t know how much longer we have together. I can’t bear the thought of losing him, but I won’t let him suffer. 7/14/21 UPDATE: Cancer progressing, but he’s still eating well. He’s slowing down and sleeps when he’s not eating. Doesn’t go out in the catio like he used to. Follow up visit to vet this week to check breathing. Prayers for my sweet gentle boy. Picture one is when I first caught him - second is current. It looks awful, but he never rubs at it and he’s on pain meds. BTW, he’s the only cat I’ve ever had that I can pill and he doesn’t bite or scratch."},{"prompt":"w did you prepare for physics for the NEET?","completion":"Most Medical Students find the NEET Physics section is difficult since it contains a wide variety of theoretical concepts and numerical problems. Physics for NEET or as a matter of fact, any other exam, needs one to be very strong with the fundamentals. It needs one to be able to visualize the various processes. The application skills and problem-solving abilities can be improved easily if your basics are clear. So, you have to study with patience keeping this in mind. 1. Make a proper Strategy: Before jumping on to the preparation, you must be well versed with the pattern of the exam. Also, you need to analyse the whole syllabus for strategic learning. It is important to be well versed with the topics and syllabus. On that note, it has been highly recommended to study theory from class 11 and 12 NCERT textbooks along with other exam coaching guides. 2. Clear Your Concepts: According to Previous Year Papers, Mechanics, Heat & Thermodynamics, Electrodynamics, and Modern Physics are the most important topics in NEET Physics. So for your Physics Preparation, you must first clear the concepts related to these topics. Concepts are to be understood, not mugged up. Once you clearly see each concept for what it is all about, you will be ready for the next step. Understand the concept in such a manner that you can visualize them. 3. Learn Physics Formulas: Formulas are the backbone of Physics. Learning Formulas is the most important step while preparing NEET Physics. So, try to learn those formulas daily. 4. Make Notes: During your NEET Physics Preparation, you need to make notes of all the important formulas, theorems, and concepts. Physics Notes for NEET will help you to learn the concepts faster and will also help you in your last-minute preparation. If you are short on time for making notes from NCERT just like I was, you can refer to NCERT notes and Summaries of the NEET exam from EduRev. I refereed to EduRev notes and NCERT based tests after completing NCERT and was wondering why I didn’t find this earlier. 5. Attempt Mock test, Previous Years Papers: Practicing with mock test series, previous years papers, and solved papers is the best way to assess your weak topic areas. You can ideally put solve at least 1 mock test weekly during your revision period. In the month before your actual exam, increase your number to one mock test daily. Physics in NEET is more conceptual rather than numerical. One thing I realized the hard way is that mugging up the theoretical part won’t help in clearing NEET Exam but understanding the concepts would. Just focus on clearing the concept and everything will fall in place!"},{"prompt":"w should western countries treat citizens who leave to join ISIS and then want to come back?","completion":"As criminals."},{"prompt":"Why did Dr B.R.

Communist does not apply to liberals in any way. They have nothing resembling a communist agenda. OTOH, there are readily identifiable elements of fascism in the GOP agenda. I hate pejoratives. I can’t argue with facts. I am reluctant to throw around the word “bot” at anyone unless I am positive, which is rare for me. I encounter lots of trolls who are here to stir the pot and will not hesitate to out them. I see name-calling occurring mostly in two instances. First, when the name-caller has nothing else to offer in the way of rebuttal. Second, in frustration at being confronted with lie after lie and having refuted those lies time and again. Frustration gets the better of all of us at one time or another.

In addition to these 4 kanji’s intense focus on a single thought or intention, senshin can also mean “advanced” (spelled 先進).

It was not the first space telescope , but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy . The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's Great Observatories . The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) controls the spacecraft. [8] Hubble features a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) mirror, and its five main instruments observe in the ultraviolet , visible , and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum . Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe . Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923, and the Hubble telescope was funded and built in the 1970s by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency . Its intended launch was in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986 Challenger disaster . Hubble was finally launched in 1990, but its main mirror had beehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope]So that means that, not counting down time, Hubble has been up there taking pictures for 32 years, 3 months, and 20 days (at the time I write this). Or to put it another way: 11,798 days, counting leap years. There are several websites that make Hubble images available to the public. Hubblesite.org is one that NASA curates. It has 4,422 images in its galleries. [LINKED_TEXT: https://hubblesite.org/resource-gallery/images] [URL: https://hubblesite.org/resource-gallery/images]The European Space Agency has a Hubble image site as well.

But as you can see, we’re looking at roughly one pretty picture every 2 days or so. JWST, which has been operational since 12 July 2022, or 57 days. So we should have about 25–30 pretty pictures. But there are a lot more raw, unprocessed images available. If you want raw Hubble data, you can go to the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA): [LINKED_TEXT: Welcome to the Hubble Legacy ArchiveClose × 2022 March 19: The HLA footprint viewer no longer works because it relies on Flash. If you need footprints, we recommend using the MAST Portal . Note that the Portal also gives access to the new Hubble Advanced Products (HAP) , which include more recent observations. The HLA contains no observations acquired after 2017 October 1. Welcome to the Hubble Legacy Archive The Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) is designed to optimize science from the Hubble Space Telescope by providing online, enhanced Hubble products and advanced browsing capabilities. The HLA is a joint project of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC). Enter Site here. Hubble Catalog of Variables (2019 September 24) Hubble Source Catalog Version 3.1 (2019 June 27) HSC version 3.1 was released on 2019 June 26. It adds proper motions of over 400,000 objects in the SWEEPS field. The proper motion information is available in database tables within the HSCv3 context of the STScI CasJobs interface. We also provide a Python Jupyter notebook that queries the HSCv3 database through a Python interface to CasJobs. More details about HSC v3.1 are found here . HLA DR10.1 and Hubble Source Catalog Version 3 (2018 July 5) NEW DATA PRODUCTS Source lists from HLA DR10 have been combined to create version 3 of the Hubble Source Catalog. See the HSC Home Page for details and data access links. There are approximately 25% more ACS source lists and almost twice as many WFC3 source lists compared with HSC v2. The source list photometric quality is significantly improved. Improved astrometric calibration is based on the Gaia DR1 catalog. Shifts up to 100 arcsec have been correctly identified. 94% of the fields have matches to an external astrometric reference catalog. The scatter in magnitudes is measured using the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the differences from the median magnitude for more robust estimates. USER INTERFACE ENHANCEMENTS HSCv3 astrometric corrections are used for image cutouts and in the interactive display. The HSCv3 catalog is available for overlay in the interactive display. The older HSCv2 and HSCv1 catalogs are also accessible using the HSC Controls in the interactive display. HLA DR10 Release (2018 January 8) NEW DATA PRODUCTS All ACS and WFC3 data that were public as of 2017 October 1 have been processed. The new image processing pipeline fixes numerous data problems, including corrections for alignment shifts between exposures and a better algorithm for combining short and long exposures. The new source lists have more reliable photometry due both to the image improvements and to better tuning of parameters for the catalog software. All old ACS and WFC3 images have been replaced in this release. These new source lists were used for version 3 http://hla.stsci.edu/] [URL: http://hla.stsci.edu/]There you have to enter something to search for; if I enter M31 (the Messier catalogue number for the Andromeda galaxy), the HLA says that they have over 19,000 images. But the search results look like this: You can download the data, and get an image file with the “.FITS” extension. You’ll need an app to open and view these images. However, HLA only has data up to sometime in 2017. A better option is the MAST portal, which has data from Hubble, JWST, and other observatories. But be prepared to be patient when you search for something. A search for M31 on MAST yields over 50,000 results.

Probably the most extreme was the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Astronomers pointed Hubble at an area of the sky where there are almost no stars, so that they could see faint distant galaxies. They took 4 separate images, using 4 different filters, for a grand total of over 1 million seconds of observation time. That’s the equivalent of Hubble staring at the same patch of sky for over 11½ days…all to produce this image of supposedly “empty” sky: That one image contains about 10,000 distant galaxies. So why has JWST not produced more images? Because in astronomy, getting the pretty pictures requires a lot of processing of the raw data.

It’s quite tragic. A horrible mistake made by the pilot who had the experience to know better. While the media tries to sensationalize the story by saying “there was no ground warning system on board” That poor reporting can sum up how they’ve reported everything else in aviation: A blatant lie. The helicopter could have been equipped with the system, the outcome as we know, would be the same. The pilot was flying SVFR and low to the ground, therefore it would have been turned off. If the aircraft was was equipped, and If, for whatever reason the pilot decided to keep it on, and listened to “terrain….terrain….pull up. Pull up.” The entire trip, the outcome would have been the same as well. It would have been going off the entire time, and he wouldn’t have known when it’s a real warning or not. What would have prevented this accident? It’s quite simple. The pilot was tooling around SVFR in terrain and paid the price for it, and took others with him. I live right off Topanga Canyon / 101. I can tell you the weather can be completely different from Van Nuys as the marine layer starts coming over the top of the Santa Monica mountains. The weather was likely getting worse heading north over the 101 (rising elevation until you head down the grade into Camarillo) and this guy was trying to head out over the coast. Flying SVFR in foggy conditions, and low to the ground, in mountainous terrain doesn’t sound too smart. The S-76 is an IFR ship.

Our government and media would see no benefit to praising the great sacrifice of our now “enemy.”The continental US was untouched by the war. Our enemies AND allies were in rubble after the war, which contributed to our rapid economic growth. If you’re the last man standing, it’s easy to believe you beat the crap out of everyone else all on your own.Likewise, since the war ended in Allied victory within a few years of the US entering, it’s easy to assume that our contribution was decisive and overwhelming even though it roughly coincided with Russia starting to chase Germany out.The US has a long history of invading Latin American and Caribbean countries at will, which can mistakenly make invading countries much bigger and half way around the world look easier than it actually will be. Even worse than the belief itself are the consequences of this “America did it alone” myth. Our financial elites think we can prevail at will in any military conflict anywhere in the world despite the evidence from Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria… This is especially disastrous since the next targets are Russia and China.

Rotary engines fixed the crankshaft to the airframe and the engine cylinder spun. The they decided this has too many disadvantages, so the engine was fixed and the crank spun. It makes for a somewhat compact engine in a linear sense but produces much more drag than an inline engine. Radials are generally a bit heavier than inline liquid cooled engines and produce less HP per CU in (KW/L). Liquid cooling means you can also use higher boost pressures with a supercharger without detonation. One advantage of radials is if you wanted more power you just add a row of cylinders. This culminated in the R-3350 [LINKED_TEXT: Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone - Wikipedia1937 18-cylinder radial piston engine family by Wright The Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone is an American twin-row, supercharged , air-cooled, radial aircraft engine with 18 cylinders displacing nearly 3,350 cubic inches (54.9 L). Power ranged from 2,200 to over 3,700 hp (1,640 to 2,760 kW), depending on the model. Developed before World War II , the R-3350's design required a long time to mature before finally being used to power the Boeing B-29 Superfortress . After the war, the engine had matured sufficiently to become a major civilian airliner design, notably in its turbo-compound forms, and was used in the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliners into the 1950s. The engine is commonly used on Hawker Sea Fury and Grumman F8F Bearcat Unlimited Class Racers at the Reno Air Races . Its main rival was the 4,360 in 3 (71.4 L), 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major , first run some seven years after the Duplex-Cyclone's beginnings. Design and development [ edit ] In 1927, Wright Aeronautical introduced its famous \\"Cyclone\\" engine, which powered a number of designs in the 1930s. After merging with Curtiss to become Curtiss-Wright in 1929, an effort was started to redesign the engine to the 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) class. The new Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 first ran successfully in 1935, and became one of the most-used aircraft engines in the 1930s and WWII, powering all frontline examples (the -C through -G models) of the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber aircraft serving in the war, each powerplant assisted by a General Electric -designed turbocharger for maximum power output at high altitudes. By 1931 Pratt & Whitney had started a development of their equally famous single-row, Wasp nine-cylinder design into a larger and much more powerful fourteen-cylinder, twin-row design — the R-1830 Twin Wasp — of a nearly identical 30-liter displacement figure, that would easily compete with this larger, single-row Cyclone. In 1935 Wright followed P&W's lead, and developed much larger engines based on the mechanics of the Cyclone. The result was two designs with a somewhat shorter stroke, a 14-cylinder design of almost 43 liters displacement that would evolve into the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone , and a much larger 18-cylinder design that became the R-3350. A larger twin-row 22-cylinder version, the Wright R-4090 Cyclone 22 , was experimented with as a competitor to the 71.5 liter-displacement four-row, 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major , but was not produced. With Pratt & Whitney starting development of their own 46 liter-displacement 18-cylinder, twin-row high-output radial as the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp in 1937, Wright's first R-3350 prototype engines — itself having a nearly 55 liter displacement figure — were initially run in May of the same year. Continued development was slow, both due to the complex nature of the engine, as well as the R-2600 receiving considerably more attention. The R-3350 did not fly until 19https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_R-3350_Duplex-Cyclone] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_R-3350_Duplex-Cyclone]and 4360 engines [LINKED_TEXT: Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia R-28 piston aircraft engine family The Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major is an American 28-cylinder four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II . First run in 1944, at 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), it is the largest-displacement aviation piston engine to be mass-produced in the United States, and at 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) the most powerful. It was the last of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp family , and the culmination of its maker's piston engine technology. The war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It powered many of the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before turbojets , but was supplanted by equivalent (and superior) powered turboprops (such as the Allison T56 ). Its main rival was the twin-row, 18-cylinder, nearly 3,350 cu in (54.9 L) displacement, up to 3,700 hp (2,800 kW) Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone , first run some seven years earlier (May 1937). Design and development [ edit ] The R-4360 was a 28- cylinder four-row air-cooled radial engine. Each row of seven air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine's \\"corncob\\" nickname. [1] A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 so that the tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds. The engine was a technological challenge and the first product from Pratt and Whitney's new plant near Kansas City, Missouri . [2] The four-row configuration had severe thermal problems that decreased reliability, with an intensive maintenance regime involving frequent replacement of cylinders required. [ citation needed ] Large cooling flaps were required, which decreased aerodynamic efficiency, putting extra demands on engine power when cooling needs were greatest. Owing in large part to the maintenance requirements of the R-4360, all airplanes equipped with it were costly to operate and suffered decreased availability. Its commercial application in the Boeing Stratocruiser was unprofitable without government subsidy. [3] Abandonment of the Stratocruiser was almost immediate when jet aircraft became available, while aircraft with smaller powerplants such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 remained in service well into the jet era. Engine displacement was 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), hence the model designation. Initial models developed 3,000 hp (2,200 kW), and later models 3,500 hp (2,600 kW). One model that used two large turbochargers in addition to the supercharger delivered 4,300 horsepower (3,200 kW). Engines weighed 3,482–3,870 lb (1,579–1,755 kg), giving a power-to-weight ratio of 1.11 hp/lb (1.82 kW/kg). Wasp Majors were produced between 1944 and 1955; 18,697 were built. A derivative engine, the Pratt & Whitney R-2180-E Twin Wasp E , was essentially the R-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_&_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major]producing over 3000 hp. The disadvantage is more moving parts means far less reliability and LOTS of maintenance per flying hour. As soon as turboprops came along radials were largely doomed because turboprops produce much more HP per lb (are lighter and more powerful) and orders of magnitude more reliable."},{"prompt":"What do hotels do with used soap?","completion":"Goes in the trash"},{"prompt":"What if Rohit Shetty directed Interstellar?","completion":"Well, NASA wouldn't have to take the pain of sending probes into the wormhole and the Professor wouldn't need to spend decades working on Plan A.

In Yajurveda prayers to appease the roaring just-born Agni who is Rudra, Rudra is also called euphemistically “Śiva”, and this has stayed on since then. This is also seen in the cognate IE deities like for instance, the Roman Silvanus/Faunus, and the classical Śiva even with Dionysius. Which is also why the destroyer Rudra is euphemistically worshiped as a fertility god Śiva in later era, to appease him. He is purely an Indo European deity in his concept, an Indo Aryan one, and nothing even remotely similar is the subject of worship of para-Aryan religions. (Brush your “pre Aryan” fancies under your carpet unless you have a culture to demonstrate that) Sometimes some local gods are currently identified with Śiva as a result of assimilating Hindu culture, but they don’t correspond to the core Śiva/Rudra who is Indo-European. The names of Rudra Agni - Īśāna, Śarva, Mahādeva etc. are all Indo European, and are named in Atharvaveda and Brāhmaṇas, and he is worshiped in Vedic Brahmanic yajñas. There is no Dravidian word or root for any of these. Śarva is also known in Avesta, (He along with Indra and Aśvins are on the list of demons to be banished from home) so his worship/renown was not just limited to Indus valley. Regarding phallus worship, it is only symbolic of the euphemistic fertility attributed to the god (and that’s also why he rides a “bull”).

A \\"smile makeover\\" is often called a \\"Hollywood smile\\" or even a \\"Wedding smile\\" because of its famous origins. Kate Middleton's grin was said to have been worked on before the royal wedding, and she appeared to have a perfectly aligned white smile on the big day. A beautiful smile can have various benefits on a person's self-esteem, self-confidence, and personal connections. Common Problems that Have Been Solved Depending on the desired result, there are a variety of cosmetic procedures accessible. Changes could be made to: The color of your teethTeeth placementTeeth size and shapeAlignment of the jawLine of the gumsThe smile's overall appearance Whitening Your Teeth You might believe that celebrities only have dazzling white smiles, yet teeth whitening is the most common cosmetic dental surgery in the UK. 48 percent of Britons are unhappy with their teeth, with over two-thirds citing tooth colour as the primary source of their dissatisfaction. Considerations for Teeth Whitening When teeth whitening is considered, you have a variety of alternatives to consider. You can spend hundreds on high-tech laser whitening therapy at a dental facility, or you can save money by purchasing a home teeth whitening kit.

Here are a few potential explanations: Ergonomics: Using a touch screen on a desktop or laptop computer for an extended period of time can be uncomfortable and can cause physical strain on the arms and hands. Apple has emphasized ergonomic design and may not want to incorporate a feature that could lead to discomfort or injury.User interface: Macs use a graphical user interface (GUI) that is optimized for use with a mouse and keyboard. Apple may believe that a touch screen would not offer significant benefits to the user experience and could even be less effective than a traditional input method for certain tasks.Product differentiation: Apple may choose not to include touch screens in their Macs to differentiate them from their iPad and iPhone products, which do have touch screens. This could help maintain a clear product identity and prevent confusion among consumers.Battery life: Using a touch screen on a laptop requires additional power, which could result in reduced battery life. Apple has prioritized battery life in their laptops, and adding a touch screen could impact that. While some users may prefer a touch screen on a Mac, Apple has opted not to include this feature. However, there are third-party touch screen displays that can be connected to Macs for users who desire this functionality."},{"prompt":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","completion":"The only thing I am upset about it, is that I still haven't seen all of his glorious tattoos."},{"prompt":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","completion":"Today , returning from running on my way I saw a girl with her dad they were running together , it reminds me my dad , when we were lived together at our town place we used to go running together. & Today however he is not living with me ,I m very far away from family, but I am continuing this habit which inscribed me by daddy.

I love you ❤️"},{"prompt":"Do you believe in karma? Why or why not?","completion":"No, I dont believe in karma and how it is defined by people. I believe in the below statement 1 and statement 2 is partially true. somewhat Statement 1 Nature believes in balance. Statement 2 (The notion of karmic definition by people) whatever we do, we will receive its consequence in the same manner as things will get balanced by nature. Both the statement looks almost similar if you read the definition but once we start looking at the equation of karma in detail it might start making sense both statements are different and miles apart. Statement 2 puts human/creature as the center of the subject. Cases will be launched through the eye of the subject. Judgment should be passed concerning the subject's action. Here we are talking about justice around each species under the sun and recording of there karma and learning about the story from their point of view. Consideration should be made not just by action we should respect intention too. It is almost certain one might take the wrong action though having the right intention(we don't have access to the future). To make things simpler if we remove intention from the equation and the external environment which affects action it is still challenging to define the judgment. Defining right and wrong itself is a super hard problem. It varies from culture to culture. It is not a function of evolution also. Current wrong actions might be a possible implication of old actions or influenced by the current environment or worse by our culture change. It might be also possible our silly genes and gray matter couldn't keep up with the pace of right and wrong ever changing defination and do things through the impulse that is flowing to us for the last 5000 years through evolution. The second statement doesn't give importance to anything it just runs based on balance. Nature need to eliminate 5000 people .It will simply kill 5000 people whoever they are criminal or saint. Example of statement 2 Consider the case there might be termites or ants in our kitchen will we kill them selectively? cause some insect stole my pastries of 500 rs and others stole cheap sugar. We will not do that way. It doesn't matter they are not important. Consider the case of rabbits increasing in Australia we kill rabbits to control their population without the action they invade our agriculture land. we kill them and shoot at sight. It might be possible rabbits not coming to agricultural land will be killed less as we dont see that sample sets often. But they(rabbits) can argue themselves they are not killed because of their good karma not destroying human crops. Humans are on the same scale as rabbits if we start discarding our self-importance. I firmly believe the truth lies in middle. Nature hardly discriminates whether you are a murderer or a saint when it comes to balancing things both of their act is so negligible against the problem it is trying to solve. It will randomly take action that helps to achieve her goal. Karma/Justice notion came because of culture. Humans have already hacked the mutation by introducing the culture. Culture is evolving super fast(only in 500 years I am sitting peacefully typing on a computer in an AC room rather than waging war in the field).500 years is a blink if we run the timeline for evolution. So justice(what is defined) by culture is more available to us. If we are still thinking I have seen people struggle because of bad karma remember this statement In an infinite set of events, there will always remain a pattern that makes you believe this is the law. We see things that we want to see in this infinite event #peace"},{"prompt":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute? He won’t trust it because I paid for it and he thinks the surveyors are wrong.","completion":"Even if your (marked) survey is done on just one line of your property (where it bounds your neighbor’s, in this case), that “line” starts and ends somewhere. These points are called “monuments”. When you bought your property it came with a description, on the deed - whether it was a lot number (which necessarily had a survey done prior to labeling), compass directional coordinates and footage measurements, or even references from and to surrounding properties by some long past owners. (Most at least reference the properties and roads that bound it). Centuries ago, you might have found references on deeds to “the stones by the white oak”, “by the gulley by the ditch”, “half the distance of the width of the creek” or (try not to crack up), “starting with the cow in the field” -which may have been a reference to a sawmill structure. Today, those references are a bit more uniform, but are continued from one owner to the next until they are combined by reference or further subdivided by a certified surveyor. (Sometimes they simply refer to a prior deed’s description if it is particularly complicated or lengthy). Generally, they are not reliant on things that may get changed by building or altering the topography of the property AND one deed should match (at least in some portion) the references of the deed of any adjoining propert(ies). Like puzzle pieces, to be exact. Monuments are the supreme determinants of most deeds. (Even if the property was first surveyed 1–200 years ago, or if it was first designed by survey only several years ago, monuments are included as corner references and are designed to be permanent, unmistakable, AND NON-REMOVABLE. Sometimes they are a pipe (described by details), sometimes they are a chiseled design indicating North, South, East, West, a deeply embedded spike, a piece of metal buried deeply designed to be located by a sensitive metal detector, or an old concrete post, but never just a compass point. They are a physical feature that can usually be located by following the description on the deed(s), much like a treasure hunt, even if you have to poke around in overgrowth to uncover them. Assuming both you and your neighbor are or are planning on RESIDING on your properties, you must also have some formal access to them - like a street that your driveways (or cart paths) will lead off of. Now, in that (or any) case, your surveys are not simply for your own pleasure, preference, or convenience, but they are dependent on surveys done for the roads that allow your use of your properties also. (In other words, whatever the beef, it’s not just dependent on the two of you ‘neighbors’. There are other interested parties also). Your neighbor’s property and deed also should be on record at a registry of land deeds. These are a matter of public record - for good reason. Your neighbor should start there - by obtaining a copy of their OWN deed - if they have any question about the survey done of your property, (although technically it was not done for you, but only for your use & reference - a tough concept to understand, I know…). IF, for some reason, your deeds do not match up, and the neighbor seriously questions the legitimacy of THE survey already done on your boundary, then they will have to challenge that survey with another, AND then through a court of law or other surveyors governing body. (Do you see the interest expanding, here, by this last)? (Incidentally, a word to the wise…the ‘new’ surveyor will not pull up the old survey stakes, just distinguish their own from them). Either way, you are not responsible for a poorly done survey, but since surveying is one of the most mathematical activities that can be conducted, the margin of error is not likely to be exceeded except by some drastic oversight. (Beyond ‘bad hair’ day). Just short of giving your neighbor a puzzle, and a roll of string, and telling them to take a hike, -and hit the road, have them obtain a copy of their own deed, - and yours for that matter - they are entitled to it for the asking, and go over both first before trying to tell you what you can and can’t do on your surveyed property. They need to be prepared to SHOW you WHY you can or can’t do something, right from the start. Just to be reasonable. Property boundary disputes are one of the most strictly regulated court processes out there. There is no room for harassment, evasiveness, repetitive threats, manipulation, out-maneuvering, or playing dumb. This is where the word Civil starts, in law. If you can’t start out that way, you don’t get a walk in court. And you might be liable for treble damages or some other fine if you can’t stick to the game plan of the courts, and answer questions simply, directly, and with factual evidence and support, on a probate matter. You may have to decide how much play you want to allow before you buckle down and tell the neighbor to stop harassing you and have their lawyer contact you - by the address on your deed. (Chances are you will never hear from one). If you do see any new survey stakes go in, do not remove them - but phone authorities immediately if ‘yours’ disappear."},{"prompt":"Why are lovemarriages unstable in comparision to arrangedmarriages?","completion":"Dear Friend, See both marriage comes with Pros and Cons….!!

Nor did he write or think about Islam that much. But he does favor Islam over Christianity. For instance he writes in his Anti-Christ (the most explicit reference of Islam you would ever find) St. Augustine, in order to realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top. It would be an error, however, to assume that there was any lack of understanding in the leaders of the Christian movement:—ah, but they were clever, clever to the point of holiness, these fathers of the church! What they lacked was something quite different. Nature neglected—perhaps forgot—to give them even the most modest endowment of respectable, of upright, of cleanly instincts.... Between ourselves, they are not even men.... If Islam despises Christianity, it has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is dealing with men. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #bhkAR]Or, The German nobility stands outside the history of the higher civilization: the reason is obvious.... Christianity, alcohol—the two great means of corruption.... Intrinsically there should be no more choice between Islam and Christianity than there is between an Arab and a Jew. The decision is already reached; nobody remains at liberty to choose here. Either a man is a Chandala or he is not.... “War to the knife with Rome! Peace and friendship with Islam!”: this was the feeling, this was the act, of that great free spirit, that genius among German emperors, Frederick II. What! must a German first be a genius, a free spirit, before he can feel decently? I can’t make out how a German could ever feel Christian.... Of course just because Nietzsche writes few good things about Islam, doesn’t mean he likes it. Nietzsche would not like Islam anyway. But the reason why Nietzsche would’ve hate Islam less than Christianity is because he probably didn’t see Islam as nihilistic as Christianity. And perhaps a religion that shares less slave morality traits than Christianity. Moreover, Nietzsche saw all religions as decadent, so Islam would not be a special thing to him. But Christianity was certainly on top of his list for the most hated religion. It is also important to note that Nietzsche grew in a Christian society. Usually at that time people were very Islamophobic. A distorted form of Islam was preached in the West. Even out there in India, the missionaries used to preach the distorted version of Islam. So, Nietzsche grew in an anti-Islamic society, yet he does not hate Islam like Christianity. Of course one could claim that Nietzsche “tried to make his friendship” with Islam because he saw Islam as an enemy of Christianity. But I tried reading few of his books, it seems like his view on Islam probably changed (implicit references). Its not that he started to like Islam. But he probably saw something among the Muslims which was missing among the Christians. There was a letter Nietzsche posted in 1881, March, where he said he wanted to live in Tunisia, among the Muslims, where the faith is the strictest. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #ePGkT] Again, that’s because Nietzsche saw the Muslims as an enemy of Europe. But still Muslim theologians are less likely to get shattered as of the Christian theologians. For instance, even the Asharite theologians would not surrender to Aristotelian teachings and would continue to fight on. Nietzsche would probably take it as a positive trait. It kinda reminds me of Dostoyevsky, who disliked Islam (and Judaism) in general, but had found Muslims to be more faithful than Christians or Jews. There’s one thing to mention. Nietzsche was well acquainted with the Christian theology. And the Christian theology (especially prior to the reformation) grew very systematically. The Catholic Church was a well constructed institution. But that’s not so with the case with Islam. Islamic theology grew fighting with each other. For instance, Asharites against Mutazilites, Kharijites against Murjites, Mutakallimun against philosophers (falsifa practitioners), this against that etc etc. In fact, we have one kind of Nietzsche in our Islamic theology. Its Ibn Taymiyyah, who would criticize anything he does not like. If Nietzsche had read these kinds of things, he’d be more and more confused about Islam. And that’s why Nietzsche took a smart step and didn’t write on a matter he didn’t care to study. And that’s why you’d see Islamic philosophers did/do not have any problem with Nietzsche either. One of the immediate influences of Nietzsche was Iqbal. Even, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, who from the traditionalist (perennial) perspective heavily criticized renaissance and onwards philosophers (Descartes, Hegel, Kant) but does not say anything negative about Nietzsche. So, as a conclusion, Nietzsche would not like Islam since he was against religion in general. He did not hold any particular opinion on it. But he favors Islam over Christianity as its not nihilistic like Christianity and less fragile and probably with less double standards “ Islam at least assumes that it is dealing with “men”” Footnotes [LINKED_TEXT: [1] ] [URL: #cite-bhkAR][LINKED_TEXT: The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Antichrist, by F.

Coming after the Pagani Huayra, the Pagani Huayra BC is the priciest Pagani car ever made. Named as a tribute to Benny Caiola, a noted Italian investor with probably the best collection of Ferraris and a very close friend of Horacio Pagani, this car is a delight for the lovers of Pagani’s details. Debuting at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, this car has a wider rear track, new sidetracks, and many cool aero features. Like the earlier version, the 6.0 liter V-12 bi-turbo engine of the BC is sourced from AMG and produces 790 horsepower and 811 lb-ft torque. This power is run to the rear wheels through the tripod drive shafts leveraging a 7-speed Xtrac transmission. And the most amazing bit is that the BC takes over the Huayra by changing the model’s standard 150 milliseconds to 75 milliseconds. At 2,685 pounds (1,218 kilograms), the BC also happens to be a lot lighter than the Huayra due to the extensive use of carbon fibers and other lightweight materials. Originally introduced as a concept car in 2013 in memory of a deceased son of the founder of Pininfarina, the legendary Italian design house, only six of these cars have been made as of yet, thus becoming one of the most coveted cars. This is one of the costliest Ferraris ever made and is based on the Ferrari 458 Spider. Each of the handmade units has an all-carbon-fiber frame and is an open-air luxury car with two seats. Like the Ferrari 458, it has no roof, side windows, and windshield, and is 330 pounds lighter than its ancestor. This makes it smarter and quicker, though it has the same naturally-aspirated 4.5 liters F136F V-8 engine, which sends 562 hp to the rear wheels. The renovated interior also comes with a host of interesting details like aerodynamic headrests built directly into the roll cage. The coolest fact about this car though is that the owners of each of the six models were chosen by the manufacturers themselves, making this one of the rarest of the rare invite-only vehicles. While there has been no price announced for this car as of yet, expert estimates place it at around 3.2 million dollars. Built under Andy Palmer, the new president of Aston Martin committed to solvency and relevance with awesome cars, this model is a renovation of the old Aston Martin-Red Bull AM-RB 001. Legend has it that Palmer agreed to this car over a drink with Red Racing’s Adrian Newey and Christian Horner. Newey, renowned aerodynamicist behind Red Bull’s expensive and award-winning sports cars in the Formula 1 tracks, devised an aerodynamic scheme specifically for this car that pushes air via the chassis, resulting in downforce without using the wings. The 6.5 liter, naturally-aspirated V-12 designed specifically for the Cosworth, has a 1:1 power /weight ratio and comes with a Rimac-built hybrid battery system coming with the engine which yields about 1,000 horsepower. As of yet, 150 units of this model have been planned by the company, and the deliveries are expected to start from 2019 onward. In addition, 25 track-only editions have been planned whose prices can only be speculated at present. Upgraded four times since its release in 2005, the Mansory Vivere edition of the Bugatti Veyron is not only among the priciest cars in the world but also one of the fastest. Modeled on the Grand Sport Vitesse Roadster, this German car has an awesome lacquered carbon-fiber body along with a new spoiler package providing new diffusers, a smarter cabin and front grill, larger side scoops, a shortened hood, and the like. The upgraded LED lights are everywhere – the headlight and taillight clusters, the cockpit. And for the aesthetically conscious, maps of history-making events like the Targa Florio race and the like are laser etched into both the upholstered, carbon fiber interior and the exterior. The 8.0-liter W16 engine of the car can produce 1,200 horsepower and 1,106 pound-feet of torque. The original version could reach up to 253 mph and be named the Car of the Decade 2000-2009. The headlights being made of, urm, 240 15-carat diamonds, is the price very surprising? And then there are the LED blades made of 420 15-carat diamonds. And all the gems are customizable. Looking like an armored car with scissor doors and an interior straight out of a sci-fi movie, this featured in the ‘Furious 7′, and has actually been drafted by the Abu Dhabi police for patrol duty! Built by W Motors, based in Lebanon, this is the first Arab supercar. And it doesn’t fare badly when compared with the traditional European biggies. Apart from its awesome looks, the twin-turbo mid-rear mounted 3.8 liter flat-six boxer can produce 780 horsepower through the rear wheels, and a 708 pound-feet of torque. It can do a 62 in a mere 2.8 seconds and can reach speeds up to 240 mph. Not a production car, this is more or less a street-legal version of the track-only McLaren P1 GTR. Converted by the British firm Lanzante, who bought the original P1 built by McLaren, it was made keeping in mind a select group of buyers in the U. S., Japan, U. K., and the UAE. This car has a lot in common with the P1 GTR and the legendary McLaren F1 road car. For example, the gold plating surrounding the engine bay with a 3.8 liter twin-turbo V-8. It is much smarter than the P1 GTR. Not only does it weigh 132 pounds (60 kg0 less than the P1 GTR, but its modified rear wing and enlarged front splitter join with the dive planes to generate 40% increased downforce as compared to the P1 GTR. The awesomeness of aerodynamics can be witnessed where it is made for on track, where it can produce 1000 horsepower. As of yet, only five units have been built, all of them being sold. Built to celebrate the company’s 50th birthday, ‘Veneno’ literally means poison in Spanish, and well, the design does look deadly. Looking almost like an alien space capsule, this car can reach speeds that can give one of those a run for their money, literally. The 6.5 liter V12 with a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission can spin at 8,400 rpm to yield 740 horsepowers and 507 pound-feet of torque, meaning that the car can do 60 mph at 2.9 seconds! The monocoque is heavily inspired by the LP700-4 Aventador and is made of carbon fiber. The sprung portion is placed on the top of a pushrod-actuated suspension, and the total dry weight of this carbon-fiber vehicle is a mere 3,285 pounds, although it is driven by a full all-wheel-drive system. Only 9 units being made, the biggest problem with these cars is their crazy resells rates- one was sold at 11 million! It was the most expensive car in the world ever produced upon its introduction, and only three being available to customers in the first lot, there was a crazy scramble to get hands-on the remaining ones. The most expensive street-legal production car in the world, this is coated with real diamonds. Yes, you read that right. ‘Trevita’ is an abbreviation translating into ‘three whites. The carbon fibers are indeed coated with a diamond dust-impregnated resin, called the Koenigsegg Proprietary Diamond Weave. This technology transformed the fibers from the traditional black to shining, silvery-white, making the bodywork of this car renowned throughout for its unique design and perfection. And that’s not all. Beneath the coating is a 4.8 liter, dual-supercharged V8 having a total output of 1,004 horsepower and 797 pound-feet of torque. This makes it well-equipped at overtaking semis in the freeway. This car comes with a one-of-its-kind dual carbon rear wing, Oconnell exhaust system, airbags, ABS-powered carbon-ceramic brakes, paddle-shift, infotainment system, chronometer instrument cluster, tires monitoring systems along with a hydraulic system. Only three cars of this model had been initially decided upon, before getting reduced to two, because the carbon fiber made it too difficult and time-consuming for regular manufacture. Named after a famous Italian racing track, Huayra Imola’s technical specs have long been shrouded in mystery. The manufacturer has recently released the technical details of the supercar. Mercedes-AMG developed a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V12 engine specifically for Pagani. The engine pumps magnificent 827 horsepower and 811 pound-feet of torque. The seven-speed automatic gearbox makes Imola more powerful than any other car in the Pagani Huayra series. Some of the spectacular features of the car include a large seven-section diffuser, a large roof scoop, more definite side skirts, a shark fin, and integrated spotlights. The gargantuan wing installed at the back of the car makes it look more aggressive. The engineers developed an exclusive paint finish to shed extra weight. They revised the geometry of the design to give ultimate suspension to the car. They installed active dampers along with a front-lift system to keep the car stable under hard acceleration and braking. Huayra Imola also features an improved Brembo brake package and especially designed Pirelli Trofeo R tires. Only five examples of Pagani Huayra Imola would ever be produced. And each is priced at a staggering 5.4 million. Bugatti Divo followed after the immense success of Chiron, however with exotic and much more exclusive specs. As the creators boast, Bugatti Divo is the most agile and dynamic car they’ve ever created. The car generates 456kg downforce at the top speed. The extra drag produced by the aerodynamic elements has reduced the top speed of Divo to 236mhp, 25mph lower than Chiron’s. With 1500 horsepower, Divo accelerates from 0 to 62mph in 2.4 seconds. While Chiron focused on top speed, Divo offers enhanced agility and driving dynamics. The redesigned exhaust system of the car features quad exhaust pipes and a retractable rear wing. To provide an improved downforce, Divo is equipped with a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car. The car also uses improved radiator cooling for the brakes, which is achieved by two vents, one installed on the bonnet and the other on the front wheel arches. Inside the car, the steering wheel is embellished with soft faux suede. The interior also features Alcantara upholstery. To save weight, the storage lockers and center console have been removed. And a carbon-fiber trim has been used throughout the interior. What Divo retains from Chiron is its quad-turbocharged W16 engine. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission has been retained too. Built by a German luxury car manufacturer, Maybach Exelero is known for its peculiar design and price tag of 8 million. Only one model of the car has ever been produced. Maybach Exelero combines the elegance and quality of high-end limousines. The car is powered by a V-12 twin-turbo engine that produces 725 pounds of torque at 2500 RPM. The engine, mounted at sixty degrees, incorporates 12 valves with 3 cylinders each. Exelero boasts a top speed of 218mph and can accelerate from 0 to 62mhp in just 4.4 seconds. The car was commissioned by a tire company that wanted to test its new line of tire family. Needless to say, the tires of Exelero are of magnificent quality. Each tire features a code, specifying its dimensions and limitations. And to prevent the wheels from locking up during braking, the car is equipped with ABS. The interior of the car is embellished with dark and red leather, neoprene, and glossy black carbon fiber. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero was featured in singer Jay-Z’s music video. And the only model of this car is owned by rapper Birdman."},{"prompt":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","completion":"Microwaves are a protected, successful, and profoundly helpful cooking strategy.

Here are some key differences between the three systems: Transfer speed: RTGS is a real-time payment system, meaning that funds are transferred immediately upon request. NEFT operates on a batch processing system, with funds transferred in intervals throughout the day. IMPS is also a real-time payment system, with funds transferred immediately upon request.Transfer limits: RTGS has the highest transfer limits of the three systems. The minimum amount that can be transferred through RTGS is Rs. 2 lakhs, while there is no maximum limit. NEFT has a maximum transfer limit of Rs. 10 lakhs. IMPS has the lowest transfer limits, with a maximum amount of Rs. 2 lakhs that can be transferred.Transfer fees: RTGS typically has the highest transfer fees of the three systems. The fees for RTGS transfers depend on the amount being transferred and the bank. NEFT has lower transfer fees compared to RTGS, and the fees depend on the amount being transferred and the bank, as well as the location of the recipient's bank.

The Lord dipped His hand into the water and pulled up a golden thimble set with sapphires. 'Is this your thimble?' the Lord asked. She replied, 'No.' The Lord again dipped into the river. He held out a golden thimble studded with rubies.'Is this your thimble?' the Lord asked. Again, she replied, 'No.' The Lord reached down again and came up with a leather thimble.'Is this your thimble ?' the Lord asked. She replied, 'Yes' The Lord was pleased with the woman's honesty and gave her all three thimbles to keep, and the seamstress went home happy. Some years later, the same woman was walking with her husband along the riverbank, and her husband fell into the river and disappeared under the water. When she cried out, the Lord again appeared and asked her, 'Why are you crying?' 'Oh Lord, my husband has fallen into the river!' The Lord went down into the water and came up with George Clooney. 'Is this your husband?' the Lord asked.'Yes,' cried the woman.The Lord was furious. 'You lied! That is an untruth!' The woman replied, 'Oh, forgive me, my Lord. It is a misunderstanding.

Infinity is greater than any number that can be named or imagined.You can imagine doubling a number every second for a hundred years. The final doubling would still be less than infinity. Infinity is so large that it has surprising properties. The number of even positive integers is infinite. The number of positive integers is infinite. The smallest infinity is the infinity of positive integers.However, the number of even positive integers is also equal to this smallest infinity. All infinities follow the rule that half of infinity is equal to infinity. Any number times infinity is equal to infinity. Any number divided into infinity yields infinity. The number of fractions is also equal to this smallest infinity."},{"prompt":"there any prayer which God hasn’t answered?","completion":"As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer about the nature of God or why prayers may or may not be answered. However, there are various perspectives and beliefs about prayer and its role in our lives. Some people believe that God always answers prayers, but the answer may not always be what we expect or want. For instance, sometimes the answer may be \\"no\\" or \\"not now,\\" or it may come in a different form than we anticipated. Other people believe that our prayers are influenced by our thoughts, beliefs, and actions, and that we need to align ourselves with the will of God in order to receive an answer. Ultimately, the reasons why some prayers are seemingly unanswered are complex and can vary depending on individual circumstances, beliefs, and perspectives. It may be helpful to seek guidance from a trusted religious or spiritual leader, or to engage in personal reflection and prayer to gain insight and understanding."},{"prompt":"got accepted to Phillips Andover for my Junior year and am very nervous to attend two years late. Is it worth transferring? What challenges might I have being a transfer student?","completion":"First and foremost, congratulations on being accepted to one of the most prestigious high school institutions in the United States! That’s a feat in itself, and you should be proud of all that you’ve accomplished and, I am sure, all that you will accomplish in the future. To answer your question: I transferred as a new Lower (year 2 of high school) and honestly, it changed my life. Being in such a competitive environment with incredible people who think so deeply, so often, and with such academic rigor, athletic superiority, and musical and artistic and literally any and all type of talent is immensely terrifying and so, so exciting. There are students who start their first years there, up to students who choose to take an additional year (Super-Senior) to attend Phillips Academy. The biggest challenge you might face is homesickness, if you haven’t ever been away from home for long periods of time, and more importantly, finding your sense of belonging. High school, after all, is still high school. As long as you keep an open mind about the people you meet, lay off the judgment, understand that the struggle is real for every single one of you, and that even if there is a ton of hard work that goes into being in such an environment, that there is the reward of learning as much as you can and also having fun—that’ll be enough to get you through. I hope this is somewhat helpful, and feel free to reach out if you have any extra questions. I’ll be happy to answer! Kind regards,"},{"prompt":"w did pirate captains earn the respect of their crew?","completion":"It’s hard to generalize since even the so-called “Golden Age” of Atlantic-Caribbean piracy lasted over a century and there was no one single way pirate crews were organized and run. But broadly speaking, a pirate who didn’t have the respect of the crew would never become captain in the first place. Piracy was an almost inevitable death sentence if captured. It was only worth the risk for a sailor through the promise of making a lot of money, and an escape from the terrible living conditions and barbaric discipline found on most merchant and Navy vessels in the 17th century. Captains and other officers were therefore expected to hold up their end of the bargain. The vast majority of crews were organized as criminal co-ops, usually with commonly agreed upon compacts. The captain might be elected and replaced by crew vote, or simply be deposed if he (there were historically female captains but they were a very small number) proved despotic, incompetent, or just unlucky. By whatever mechanism, the captain only maintained his position with the consent of the crew."},{"prompt":"https://www.researchgate.net/pub...","completion":"Glucophage® is a brand name of metformin.

String theory postulates that the very basic elementary \\"particles\\" are in fact looping, or closed strings, vibrating. The values which the \\"particles\\" we have thus far named exhibit, actually come from the vibrational pattern of each string. Meaning if a string vibrates a certain way, it will have a certain charge or some other elementary, or quantum property. The vibration of the string dictates its properties. Much the same way as a guitar string will have a different sound depending on what key you pluck.Things get complicated when the mention of calabi-yau shapes come into play, which exist not in the dimensions which the human mind can perceive, but function \\"below\\" the threshold of human perception, and unfold reality through upward causation. Which, in layman terms, would mean that there is a \\"piling of possibilities to make an actuality\\". So each string is, much like an electron itself, an \\"object\\" of possibility. There is a fundamental unity when one reaches the ultimate layer of reality. In this intrinsic field especially, all things are one and the same thing. Strings are supposedly but the first vibrational manifestation that \\"sparks\\" out of this field of unity, and endow it with vibrational patterns that ultimately form everything that is."},{"prompt":"What are the best Magento 2 form builder extensions in 2019?","completion":"There are plennty of options available to develop your e-commerce website.

I insisted that people have been hiking those routes for thousands of years in sandals, and it was hot. They argued about ankle support and such nonsense. I wore the sandals. I was fine. Everyone else was hot, and their feet hurt. I gave in and brought hiking boots on my first solo backpacking trip in 2005. I insisted on also bringing a pair of moccasins.

Most mutual funds have beaten benchmark only 5 out of 15 years. If you remove years 2014 and 2015, every single largecap and midcap mutual fund is comprehensively by benchmark.

Phosphorus trichloride is a rare compound with the chemical formula PCl3. Pure liquid, a pure chemical, is an important industrial chemical, used in the production of phosphites and other organophosphorus compounds. It is toxic and reacts violently with water to release hydrogen chloride. Phosphorus trichloride is a precursor to organophosphorus compounds that contain one or more P (III) atoms, mainly phosphites and phosphonates. These compounds do not usually contain the chlorine atoms found in PCl3. PCl3 reacts violently with water to form phosphorus acid, H3PO3 and HCl. A large number of similar reaction reactions are known, most importantly the formation of phosphites by reaction with alcohol or phenols. For example, with phenol, triphenyl phosphite is formed.
