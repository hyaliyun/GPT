Betty hired Christine as a contractor to build a retaining wall and","completion":"install a concrete patio in her backyard. Being an intelligent and savvy homeowner, Betty had done extensive research on various designs, materials, and techniques for such projects before deciding to work with Christine. She was particularly impressed by Christine's portfolio of work that showcased a range of well-executed projects, ranging from elaborate outdoor entertainment areas to small, intimate spaces. Before construction began, Betty and Christine set clear expectations for the project. They agreed on a timeline, budget, and specific goals, which were documented in a comprehensive project plan. This plan not only detailed the types of materials to be used but also outlined the aesthetic aspects of the design, such as color schemes, furniture layout, and landscaping. As the project started, Christine and her team began by excavating the area to prepare it for the retaining wall and patio. They ensured that they carefully removed and preserved the existing plants and shrubs in Betty's yard, as she had expressed her desire to replant them once the work was completed. During the excavation phase, Christine's team discovered a network of tree roots that would significantly affect the retaining wall's installation. Christine communicated this challenge to Betty and suggested a slightly altered design that would still provide an effective retaining wall while accommodating the tree roots. Betty appreciated Christine's transparency and agreed to the change, and they updated the project plan accordingly. Once the excavation was finalized, the team started constructing the retaining wall. They used a combination of concrete blocks and natural stones to achieve a visually appealing finish that complemented the existing yard and the future patio. Throughout the construction process, Christine ensured that proper drainage paths were built into the wall to prevent water damage and protect the integrity of the structure. After completing the retaining wall, the team then moved on to the installation of the concrete patio. Christine worked closely with Betty to determine the ideal location, size, and shape of the patio. They decided on an irregular pattern that would integrate well with the surrounding landscape while maximizing the usable space for outdoor dining and entertaining. The team poured and finished the concrete with a textured surface to provide a non-slippery flooring that would look elegant and modern. Once the patio had cured, Christine and her team began the process of landscaping around the new structure. They re-planted the preserved plants and added new ones to enhance the overall appearance of the backyard. Lighting fixtures were installed to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere during the evening hours. Lastly, the outdoor furniture was carefully arranged, bringing the entire project together and fulfilling the vision that Betty and Christine had initially discussed. Throughout the entire project, Christine maintained open and honest communication with Betty, updating her on daily progress and discussing any changes or challenges that arose. This allowed them to collaboratively address issues and keep the project on track and within the agreed-upon budget. In the end, Betty was thrilled with the final results and couldn't wait to host her first party on the newly installed patio. Christine took pride in having helped Betty transform her backyard into a functional and beautiful space, adding another successful project to her growing portfolio."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both women are attracted to Jimmy, a tormented young man who is still in love with his estranged wife Elinor. Back in New York, Bubbles finds work in a burlesque club, while Madame Basilova, the girls' teacher and manager, arranges an audition for Judy with ballet impresario Steve Adams.

Would \\"A 2012 article in The Daily Telegraph says that ExxonMobil has \\"grown into one of the planet’s most hated corporations, able to determine American foreign policy and the fate of entire nations\\".\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the statement from the 2012 article in The Daily Telegraph does not accurately answer your question, \\"Who owns Exxon Mobil?\\" Exxon Mobil is a publicly traded multinational corporation, which means it is owned by shareholders who own public stock issued by the company. Ownership is spread across various individual and institutional investors who hold these shares. Large institutional investors often include retirement or pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds. Anyone who owns shares in Exxon Mobil technically owns a portion of the company—the more shares they own, the larger their ownership stake. However, majority ownership often depends on large institutional investors. It's important to note that while some shareholders may own enough stock to have a significant voting power at shareholder meetings, this control does not translate directly into the ability to determine a country's foreign policy, as the article suggests. Exxon Mobil's possession of significant resources and economic power does sometimes influence national and international politics, but equating this indirect, lobbying-type influence to direct determinative control over a country's policy would be an overstatement. The management of Exxon Mobil, as with other corporations, is tasked with running business operations, while strategic decisions, such as election of the board of directors or approval of mergers and acquisitions, are typically voted on by the shareholders.

The main characters are a group of crafty neighborhood kids, known as 'The Gang,' a tight-knit group of four (Sam, Alex, Sara, and Eddie) with a shared love for pranks and adventures. One of the key characters is Spanky, the school bully and a local talent show star renowned for his singing. Plot: Step 1. Inciting incident: After another episode of Spanky's bullying at school, 'The Gang' decides it's time to teach Spanky a lesson. Coincidentally, the annual neighborhood talent show is announced, where Spanky intends to perform his singing act again. 'The Gang' sees this as an opportunity to make Spanky flop publicly. Step 2. Planning phase: 'The Gang' devises a clever plan to use unlikely tools - peashooters and noisemakers. They justify these choices as the peashooters will distract Spanky causing him to miss his cues, and the noisemakers will jolt Spanky, unsettling his performance. This strategy is summed up as 'Disturb and Disrupt.' Step 3. Assembling tools and training: 'The Gang' begins to prepare, assembling and modifying peashooters, practicing their aim while sneaking around to avoid raising suspicion. Meanwhile, they also procure various types of noisemakers, training themselves to time their use perfectly to maximize the disruption. Step 4. Obstacles and Resolution: On the night of the talent show, as per their plan, 'The Gang' positions themselves strategically. However, a couple of unforeseen events – a lost peashooter and a vigilant show organizer - threaten their plan. Amidst these obstacles, 'The Gang' stays determined. They improvise their plan, using their quick-thinking abilities, successfully causing confusion and noise, ultimately leading to Spanky's flopped performance. Step 5. Eventual Triumph: Post the entertaining misadventures, Spanky, embarrassed after his public flop, takes this as a wake-up call, realizing the error in his bullying ways. Meanwhile, 'The Gang' celebrates their triumph over the bully and gets recognized by their peers and adults alike for their courage and teamwork, gaining a newfound respect in their neighborhood. And that's how peashooters and noisemakers made Spanky flop. This plot ensures a balance of humor, drama, adventure, and a valuable lesson to counter bullying. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of teamwork and courage, making it appealing to individuals across different ages. The inclusion of peashooters and noisemakers adds an element of novelty and fun, making the plot more engaging."},{"prompt":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull.

Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wouldn't, the promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat, after all isn't he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after watching Aag. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! So Veeru becomes Heero (how corny is that?), guess Heeru wouldn't sound that great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) doesn't exists at all. In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak by the end. Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl.

But their anxieties were speedily relieved on learning that Tom was at Sacramento City, and, it was to be hoped, doing well. As Ned had eaten nothing on the day of his arrival since early morning, the first care of his friends was to cook some food for him; and Larry took special care to brew for him, as soon as possible, a stiff tumbler of hot brandy and water, which, as he was wet and weary, was particularly acceptable.

Vojislav Kostunica, the former Prime Minister of Serbia, held talks with key figures of the European Union, including European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn. One of the primary topics of discussion was the sensitive issue of Kosovo's potential separation from Serbia. At the time, Kostunica was deeply concerned about the prospect of Kosovo gaining independence without a proper mandate and authorization through a United Nations Security Council resolution. As a result, Kostunica sought support from the European Union in averting such an outcome. He specifically requested that the EU assist in preventing Kosovo from unilaterally declaring independence and taking steps towards separation from Serbia without an appropriate legal framework in place. The issue of Kosovo's independence was a highly contentious and sensitive matter among the international community, with many countries having differing perspectives on its legitimacy. The involvement of the European Union in these discussions played a significant role in shaping the political landscape and the future of relations between Serbia and Kosovo. In response to Kostunica's concerns, the European Union recognized and acknowledged the importance of ensuring a stable and just resolution to the Kosovo issue. This led to a continued engagement and dialogue among the involved parties, aiming towards an agreement and resolution that would be acceptable to all sides. Ultimately, the EU's role in facilitating such discussions - in conjunction with the position and influence of other international actors - contributed to the ongoing development of the situation and its eventual outcomes. Despite Kostunica's appeals for assistance and the EU's involvement in negotiations, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008. However, the EU continued to act as a mediator and participant in discussions seeking to further stabilize the region and enhance cooperation between Serbia and Kosovo, as well as ongoing efforts towards European integration and enlargement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who retreated to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire? from the following article ? Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US.

Question: How would Bailey feel afterwards? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: like they lack comanionship B: like they are cut off C: like they can talk Answer:","completion":"C: like they can talk According to the given context, Bailey's last cell phone stopped working, which led them to go to the cell phone store to get a new one. The context indicates that the purpose of going to the store was to find a working cell phone, which implies that Bailey's primary concern was to restore their ability to communicate. Option A, \\"like they lack companionship,\\" does not fit the context, as there is no mention of Bailey feeling lonely or needing companionship. Option B, \\"like they are cut off,\\" also does not align with the context, as Bailey's visit to the cell phone store implies that they want to reconnect with others and not to be cut off. This makes Option C, \\"like they can talk,\\" the best answer according to the context given. Upon acquiring a new cell phone, Bailey would likely feel relieved and satisfied, as their communication capabilities have been restored. This would enable them to reach out to friends, family, or coworkers, and resume any daily activities that may have been hindered by the lack of a working cell phone.

But \\"How are you\\" is also a very unusual question. It's a question that often doesn't need an answer. The person who asks \\"How are you?\\" hopes to hear the answer \\" Fine\\", even if the person's friend isn't fine. The reason is that \\"How are you?\\" isn't really a question and \\"Fine\\" isn't really an answer. They are simply other ways of saying \\"Hello\\" or \\"Hi\\". Sometimes, people also don't say exactly what they mean. For example, when someone asks \\"Do you agree?\\" the other person might think, \\"No, I disagree. I think you're wrong...\\" But it isn't very polite to disagree so strongly, so the other person might say \\"I'm not sure.\\" It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people. For example, may talks over the phone finish when one person says \\"I've to go now.\\" Often, the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse \\"Someone's at the door.\\" \\"Something is burning on the stove.\\" The excuses might be real, or not. _ The excuse is more polite, and it doesn't hurt the other person. Whether they are greeting each other, talking about an idea, or finishing a talk, people don't say exactly that they are thinking. It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other, and it's part of the rule of the game of language. Question: When a person disagree with someone, it is polite to say \\" _ \\". Yes or no, is the answer \\"I'm not sure\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"I'm not sure\\" is considered more polite when a person disagrees with someone. It is a gentler way to express disagreement in a conversation without coming across as too confrontational or aggressive. By saying \\"I'm not sure,\\" the person is indirectly conveying that they do not agree with the other individual's statement or opinion but are doing so in a manner that maintains a respectful and diplomatic tone. In the given article, the author highlights the subtle nuances in language and communication that exhibit politeness and maintain a friendly atmosphere during interactions. In various situations, people may choose not to say exactly what they are thinking in order to be courteous to others. These linguistic subtleties create a buffer, allowing people to express their thoughts and feelings in a more civil and thoughtful manner, thereby contributing to social harmony. This phenomenon of indirect communication can be seen not only while expressing disagreement but also during greetings or when ending conversations. In the case of the greeting \\"How are you?\\" people may respond with \\"Fine,\\" even if they are not actually doing well, to adhere to social conventions and avoid burdening the other person with their own problems. Similarly, during phone calls, people may provide an excuse, real or fabricated, as a polite way of ending the conversation without causing any hurt or offense to the other person. In conclusion, the answer \\"I'm not sure\\" is a polite way to express disagreement in a conversation, maintaining a respectful and considerate tone. The subtleties of language and communication help foster social harmony and enable people to navigate interpersonal interactions in a more thoughtful and pleasant manner."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

I have a fairly new Casio camera that is faster and is a 10.1 megapixel, but the file size takes too long to load on ebay. The Olympus has a 3+ megapixel, and the file size is about 1/4 the Casio. These load fine and are good photos. My only complaint is the size. It is about the same height and depth, but the thickness is about four times the size of the Casio. I guess when this was new that was OK, but just something I thought I'd point out.Conclusion: If you need a good basic camera and don't mind the thickness, this is a nice older model that still works well today. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light. The user acknowledges that the Olympus camera, despite being an older model, still works well today and is suitable for their needs, particularly when it comes to uploading photos on eBay. They mention the adequate 3+ megapixel resolution and smaller file sizes compared to their newer Casio camera. However, there is a slight unflattering aspect brought up in the review – the thickness of the Olympus camera. The user notes that it's about four times larger than their Casio camera, which may be a concern for some potential buyers who prefer a slim and compact device. Overall, the review leans more towards a positive portrayal of the product, emphasizing its practical use and functionality despite its age and thickness."},{"prompt":"When it's 10:15 in New York, it's 9:15 in Salt Lake City, and 7:15 in San Francisco - isn't it? This consistent and orderly time system, based on a grid of time zones, seems so natural that people rarely give it a moment's thought. So you may find it surprising to learn that prior to the late 1800s each community established its own time - by looking at the sun. When the sun shone directly overhead in Washington, D.C., for example, it was 12:00 noon there; up the road in Philadelphia, however, it was 12:07, and in Boston it was 12:24. To measure time with accuracy, it is necessary to move the clock about one minute for every twelve miles of distance; so according to \\"sun time\\" your pocket watch would be slightly incorrect if you ventured only a few miles down the road. It was not until the advent of widespread railroad travel that a need arose for regularized time. At one point over 300 local times were honored within the country, making it literally impossible for trains to arrive consistently on time everywhere. As a result, in 1883 the continental, United States was divided into four time longitude. The standardization resulting from this system proved so helpful that in 1884 the International Meridian Conference applied the same procedure to establish time zones around the world. Thus, if it is 11:07 p.m. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, a little simple research will quickly determine that in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, it is 9:07 A.M. - and not 9:15. The cause of the regularized time is_.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs.

She sweetens the deal with a 25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow. When at the club, Gentry encounters a waitress, Marlene (Hedda Lubin), whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He gets through her to speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect, Joseph Carter. Soon, another stripper, Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout (Ray Sager), an unstable veteran who takes pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like \\"Lewd is Crude\\", \\"Quit with Tit\\" and \\"Women Right On!\\". Pickles, another stripper, is murdered and has her buttocks mutilated with a meat tenderizer hammer before having it salt and peppered. A badge with \\"Women Right On!\\" is found at the scene. Meanwhile, Gentry buys Weston many drinks to keep her drunk and out of his way. During one of Weston's drunken episodes she admits she's attracted to Gentry. Gentry ignores this and concentrates on the case. His investigation takes him to the owner of the strip clubs in town, Mr. Marzdone Mobilie (Henny Youngman).

Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the crotchety old Gramps orders Mr. Brink off the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can. Pud's busybody Aunt Demetria has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy.

In the census, Cornwall was the local authority where the greatest number of people recorded a second address. A total of 22,997 people who were usually resident elsewhere in England and Wales, had a second address in Cornwall which was used for 30 days or more each year. Launching his party's charter, he said he also wanted to \\"close the gap\\" between urban and rural areas in the provision of high-speed broadband, ensuring that 99.9% of households were covered. Mr Clegg said the rural economy was worth Â£210bn and was crucial to the UK. Where do people have holiday homes? Source: Census 2011 - Office for National Statistics How many people have second homes? He added: \\"The Liberal Democrats want to unlock this potential so rural areas and the rest of the UK can thrive. \\"In order to prosper, rural areas need good local services, appropriate infrastructure and more housing. \\"Only the Liberal Democrats will create a stronger economy and fairer society where everyone and every part of the UK can reach its full potential.\\" This election issue includes rural and agricultural policies and countryside funding. Policy guide: Where the parties stand The party also says it will take action to protect rural post offices and other essential services from closure; prioritise rural housing and boost tourism by introducing a \\"fuller\\" right to roam, and new national nature parks. The charter will also aim to support fishing communities and make rural settlements safer by creating \\"retained\\" police officers, who would be fully trained and on-call to respond quickly where needed. Other measures include help for farming, strengthening the powers of the Groceries Code Adjudicator to ensure farmers are paid fairly, publishing a national food strategy, and developing an animal disease strategy to lessen the risks and costs of animal disease. On rural issues, the Conservatives have pledged to invest Â£2.3bn in more than 1,400 flood defence schemes to protect 300,000 homes, while Labour said they would protect food producers from unfair practices by big supermarkets. The Greens would end factory farming and animal testing and improve protection for animals, and UKIP pledge to abolish the export of live animals for slaughter.

The two men, Manuel Lopez Ambrosio and Mauricio Lopez Bonilla, have been accused of using public funds to buy a helicopter that was given as a gift to former President Otto Perez Molina. He was arrested in September after standing down amid widespread anti-corruption protests. Mr Perez Molina denies all the charges. Mr Lopez Ambrosio served as defence minister and Mr Lopez Bonilla as interior minister in Mr Perez Molina's government. They are facing several charges, including money laundering and conspiracy. The government was brought down last year by a scandal involving Guatemala's customs services. Vice-President Roxana Baldetti was forced to resign in May after the scandal became public, prompting Guatemalans to take to the streets in anger. Ms Baldetti was accused of running the bribery scheme. She has denied the accusations. The scandal has been dubbed \\"La Linea\\", or \\"The Line\\", after the hotline businesses allegedly rang to clear their imports through customs at cut-price rates. Protests demanding the resignation of the president went on for months in the impoverished Central American nation last year. Mr Perez Molina finally stood down on 2 September, four months before the end of his term. He was arrested a day later. A former television comedian with no previous experience in government, Jimmy Morales, was elected in the scheduled October presidential elections. He took office in January promising to fight corruption in Guatemala. The corruption investigations are being headed by the UN-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG).

The Knox case, \\"was a textbook example of our never-ending fascination with the supposed femme fatale,\\" Nina Burleigh writes at the Los Angeles Times. Knox became a scapegoat and was subjected to \\"all manner of outlandish, misogynistic behavior\\" because of the focus on Knox herself—\\"her femaleness, her American-ness, her beauty\\"—instead of the facts.

The ineffectiveness of the justice system in Italy—where \\"appointments are invariably made through nepotism rather than competence\\"—means rulings are rarely convincing, conspiracy theorists run rampant, and the line between fact and fiction is too often blurred, writes Tobias Jones at the Guardian.

Now that she has been freed, with the prosecution's case against her deemed too far-fetched, the focus shifts from the case itself to the deeper issues it exposed. This includes the Italian legal system's misogyny, sensationalized portrayal of Knox as a femme fatale, and the ineffectiveness of the justice system in Italy. Body: 1. Amanda Knox as scapegoat and femme fatale - Knox became a scapegoat subjected to misogynistic behavior in the Italian press. - Main focus on her femaleness, American-ness, and beauty rather than on the facts of the case. - Public fascination with Knox as a supposed femme fatale drew attention away from the implausibility of the prosecution's case. 2. The prosecution's far-fetched case - The verdict confirms that there was never sufficient evidence to prove Knox murdered her roommate. - Knox was guilty of insensitive behavior and pot use, but not murder. - Italian legal system should have accepted that the police had been wrong in their investigation. 3. Ineffectiveness of the Italian justice system - Appointments in the Italian legal system are often based on nepotism rather than competence. - Rulings are rarely convincing, conspiracy theorists run rampant, and the line between fact and fiction is blurred. - Silvio Berlusconi is desperate to reform the judiciary but also desperate to avoid it. Conclusion: The Amanda Knox case raises questions about the role of misogyny and the sensationalism of her portrayal in the Italian legal system's handling of the case. The obsession with Knox's \\"femme fatale\\" image overshadowed the lack of substantial evidence against her, leading to a miscarriage of justice. While there is relief that Knox has been freed, this case highlights the need to address the deeper flaws within the Italian justice system that could affect countless others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Secret to a Happy Life: Understanding, Respect, and Self-awareness Once upon a time, in a land where everyone wanted to be happy, people found a secret to live joyfully. The secret had three special ingredients: understanding, respect, and self-awareness. These three ingredients made people's days brighter and their smiles wider. Let's learn more about each ingredient and discover how to use them in our own lives. First, let's talk about understanding. When you try to understand someone else, you listen to what they say and how they feel. Imagine if you see your friend crying because they lost their favorite toy. You might also feel sad for them because you know losing a toy is no fun at all. By understanding their feelings, you can be a good friend and help them feel better. Now let's talk about respecting differences. No two people are alike – that's what makes us special! Everyone has their favorite ice cream flavor, games they like to play, and colors they find pretty. It's important to remember that people have different thoughts and feelings, and that's okay. Just like how you may love chocolate ice cream but your best friend loves strawberry; it doesn't mean one is better than the other. It's just different. By respecting these differences, we can all get along better and be happier together. The third special ingredient is called self-awareness, which means being aware of your own feelings and actions. Imagine you are very hungry and get upset easily because of it. If you know that being hungry makes you grumpy, you can tell yourself, \\"Hey, I need to eat something before I get too upset.\\" And then, you can eat a snack to feel better. By knowing yourself and what makes you feel a certain way, you can take care of yourself and your feelings even better. So, let's put all the ingredients together: understanding, respect, and self-awareness. When you try to understand others, respect their differences, and know more about yourself, you're on the way to a happier life. It's like cooking up a delicious soup that makes everyone feel warm and happy inside. Remember, your friends and family may have different thoughts and feelings, but that's what makes life interesting and exciting. If we work together, by listening, respecting, and taking care of ourselves, we can create a world where everyone feels happy and loved. And that, dear children, is the true secret of a joyful life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

He was one of the original seven astronauts chosen for Project Mercury, the first effort by the United States to put humans in space. On October 3, 1962, he flew a six-orbit, nine-hour, Mercury-Atlas 8 mission becoming the fifth American, and ninth human, to travel to space. In the two-man Gemini program, he achieved the first space rendezvous, station-keeping his Gemini 6A spacecraft within 1 foot (30 cm) of the sister Gemini 7 spacecraft in December 1965. In mid-1966, Schirra was assigned to command a three-man Apollo crew with Donn F. Eisele and R. Walter Cunningham to make the second manned flight test of the Apollo Command/Service Module, with a mission profile identical to Apollo 1. Schirra argued against a repeat mission, and his crew became the backup crew for Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. Schirra's crew conducted tests in the command module on January 26, 1967, and were enroute to Houston the next day when Grissom, White, and Young were killed in a fire during a test. Schirra's crew became the prime crew of the first manned flight. This became Apollo 7 in the program's revised mission numbering plan, and was delayed to the fall of 1968 while safety improvements were made to the Command Module. Schirra gained a sense of security from having Guenter Wendt, a McDonnell Aircraft employee, as the pad leader responsible for the spacecraft's launch readiness. But since the Apollo contractor was North American Aviation, Wendt was no longer pad leader. After the Apollo 1 accident, Schirra felt so strongly he wanted none other than Wendt as pad leader for his Apollo flight, that he pulled strings with his boss Deke Slayton and North American's launch operations manager Bastian \\"Buzz\\" Hello to hire Wendt as Apollo 7 pad leader. Wendt remained pad leader for the remainder of the Apollo and Skylab programs, and stayed on with NASA into the Space Shuttle program before retiring. Apollo 7 was launched on October 11, 1968, making Schirra the first person to fly in space three times. Prior to launch, Schirra had objected because of high winds, which could have injured the astronauts in the event of an abort within the first minute of the mission. After reaching orbit, the Apollo 7 CSM performed space rendezvous and docking exercises with the S-4B stage to simulate retrieving the Lunar Module. On the second day of the mission, the crew conducted the first live television pictures publicly broadcast from inside a manned spacecraft. During the mission, Schirra became sick with a head cold, which he passed to Eisele. Anticipating issues with congestion inside of a sealed spacesuit, Schirra proposed to Mission Control that they would not wear their helmets during reentry. Despite a request from Chris Kraft and Deke Slayton to wear helmets during reentry, Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham refused and performed reentry without them. Apollo 7 landed southeast of Bermuda on October 22, 1968. Prior to the Apollo 7 launch, Schirra had made the decision to retire after the flight, and left the NASA Astronaut Corps on July 1, 1969. Schirra's last assignment as an astronaut was to conduct the investigation into Neil Armstrong's Lunar Landing Research Vehicle crash.

They have to pass a test which involves spending the night in a closed amusement park on an island. Naturally the other fraternity brothers plan to sneak aboard and scare the pledges. Naturally there's a deranged killer in a clow suit wandering around killing everybody. And then there's a bunch of ghosts thrown in...Stupid and boring. For one thing all these actors are way over college age...and look it. For another the acting is abysmal. There's not one good acting job here. The script is hopeless--full of bad jokes and terrible dialogue. The killings are largely bloodless and not even remotely scary. The only remotely interesting part of this is a cute guy who has a nude scene at the beginning (back view only)...but that's hardly enough to recommend the movie. Skip this one.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"When was the second vaccine mentioned created\\" Context: \\"Early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period, primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases. In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The second vaccine mentioned created was the first diphtheria vaccine, which was produced in 1914.

We need to find out what 'm' is. First, we will simplify the problem. We have two \\"m's\\" there: 44883 * m and - 42437 * m.

Q:Process: - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf. Question: suppose The solar system is smaller happens, how will it affect a SMALLER white dwarf star. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"The solar system being smaller can have a range of potential effects on a smaller white dwarf star, depending on various factors such as the distance between the star and other celestial bodies in the solar system, the mass of the celestial bodies, and the overall smaller scale of the solar system. It is crucial to consider the interplay of these factors to assess the effect on a white dwarf star in a reduced solar system accurately. 1. Gravitational Pull: The gravitational forces in a smaller solar system could be, in general, stronger due to the closer proximity between celestial bodies. Thus, a smaller white dwarf could be more influenced by the gravitational pull from other nearby celestial objects, such as planets or other stars. This might alter its orbit or cause an increase in tidal forces experienced by the star. 2. Resource Availability: In a smaller solar system, resources such as gases and other materials may also be more concentrated. This could potentially change the rate at which a white dwarf's mass is lost, as it might accrete material from its surroundings at a different rate compared to a white dwarf in a larger solar system. 3. Stellar Interactions: The dynamics between stars would become more critical in a smaller solar system, as stars would be in closer proximity, increasing the likelihood of stellar interactions. This might lead to various scenarios, such as mass transfer between stars or even collisions, which could directly impact a smaller white dwarf. 4. Habitable Zones: A smaller solar system could also impact the habitable zones around stars, especially if the overall scale were reduced. This might change the likelihood of finding potentially habitable planets around a smaller white dwarf star. Given these considerations, it is challenging to provide a straightforward answer like A: more, B: less, or C: no effect, as the influence on a smaller white dwarf star could vary depending on the specific conditions and dynamics of the smaller solar system. The effects on a smaller white dwarf in a reduced solar system would most likely be a combination of influences related to the factors mentioned above, rather than one particular outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

It was a sunny day outside, and Ellie had spent hours carefully selecting her clothes for the occasion. She had chosen a beautiful, flowy white sundress with delicate blue and purple floral patterns adorning it. The dress was stylish, yet comfortable, and it suited her perfectly for the picnic she planned to attend later that afternoon. As she meticulously applied the blue nail polish, Ellie couldn't help but think about the first time she had worn this dress: to her sister's graduation party nearly two years ago. That particular day had been one of the most memorable, laughter-filled, and joyous events in her life. It had been a gathering of their closest friends and family members, and everyone had remarked on how lovely Ellie looked in her new dress. The positive comments had left her feeling confident and radiant, and she cherished that moment. Now, as she sat at her vanity, carefully painting each nail a glossy blue, Ellie was excited to bring that happy memory into her present. She felt the shade of blue would accentuate the floral design on the dress and capture the essence of the spring afternoon ahead. Furthermore, she believed that the color itself represented a blend of tranquility and creativity, which were characteristics Ellie wanted to embody at the picnic. Ellie glanced around her room, scanning carefully for the right accessories to complete her look. She spotted a delicate silver bracelet with intricate blue beads that her mother had gifted her on her 16th birthday. As she fastened it around her wrist, Ellie felt a wave of gratitude for the love and support her family had always shown her. Her gaze then landed on a pair of elegant, silver hoop earrings that were a perfect match to her bracelet. Once Ellie secured them in her ears, she felt her outfit was just about complete. All she needed now was a pair of sandals to go with it. In the back of her closet, she found her favorite pair of white strappy sandals and slid them onto her freshly painted toenails. The shoes effortlessly blended comfort and style, just like the rest of her ensemble. Finally satisfied with her appearance, Ellie grabbed her picnic essentials – a blanket, sunglasses, sunscreen, a cooler filled with refreshments, and a basket containing a variety of sandwiches and snacks – and began loading them into her car. As she closed the trunk and climbed into the driver's seat, Ellie took a deep breath, inhaling the sweet scent of blooming flowers that filled the air. With a soft smile playing on her lips, Ellie started her car and began her drive to the park for the picnic. As the gentle breeze played with her flowing dress, she thought about the people she would reconnect with and the memories they would create. She knew that happiness was not determined by the color of her nail polish or the beauty of her dress, but those little details and the associations with those she loved brought extra joy into her life. With the serene shade of blue on her nails and happy memories in her heart, Ellie was ready to embrace the delights of the day and cherish the warmth of shared moments with her friends and family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To make it as an entrepreneur, you must be willing to work seven days out of the week. This will often involve long, sleepless nights of coming up with new ideas and working out solutions to problems that spring up along the way. Before you take on the challenge, be sure that you have the determination to stick with it. Your new distillery won’t be making any money in its infancy. Unless you have a benefactor or receive a sizable business loan, you’ll likely have to juggle the responsibilities of devising a business strategy while working other jobs to pay the rent. Speak to other entrepreneurs who have opened their own distilleries and ask if they have any helpful advice to share with you. There’s a lot of legal regulation surrounding breweries, distilleries and other businesses that manufacture and sell alcohol. First, you’ll have to obtain a distiller’s permit from the appropriate government agency. Following that, you’ll need to be approved for a liquor license and other applicable permits at the state or local level. Without the proper paperwork, you won’t be able to move forward with opening your distillery. Those living in the United States can visit the website of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to complete the application process for a distiller's permit, as well as request additional information and materials. The legal processes involved with starting a distillery are straightforward, but can be time-consuming. It’s best to get started as soon as you’ve made up your mind to pursue your goal. To be the best you can possibly be at what you do, you’ll need to become a walking encyclopedia of liquor-related knowledge. Sample as many liquors as you can, visit other distilleries and keep your eyes and ears open for new developments in the industry. Always be looking to expand your knowledge on both the practical and business end of things. Get in the habit of trying new brands and brews regularly. You should have a wealth of firsthand experience to be able to articulate the differences between your product and others. Attend distillery festivals and special events whenever possible. These types of events usually feature an enormous selection of craft spirits, and can provide a great hands-on learning opportunity. What can you do to make your distillery stand out among your competitors? You might plan on employing an inventive hybrid distilling method or incorporating never-before-seen ingredients into the mix. Or perhaps you’re determined to introduce people who don’t drink gin to the beverage in an enjoyable way. Whatever your approach may be, you should aim to proceed with a clear purpose in mind.

Next question: who came up with the teenage mutant ninja turtles?","completion":"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a popular and enduring franchise, was created by two comic book artists and writers, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. The duo developed the concept in November 1983, during a brainstorming session at Peter Laird's apartment in Dover, New Hampshire. The late-night session resulted in a humorous drawing by Kevin Eastman, which soon prompted Peter Laird to sketch his own version. The characters evolved from these initial doodles into the team of anthropomorphic turtle ninjas we know and love today. Eastman and Laird published the first issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in May 1984 under their independent comic book label \\"Mirage Studios.\\" Mirage Studios' name was derived from the fact that it didn't actually have a proper studio, just the artists' shared apartment. The comic was launched as a parody of popular comic book series at the time, including Marvel's Daredevil, New Mutants, and Frank Miller's Ronin, and the name 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' was concocted to reflect and satirize the prevalent tropes in these comics. Eastman and Laird self-financed the printing of 3,000 copies of their first issue. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' debut was an instant hit and quickly became an underground comic book sensation, selling the entire first run within a few weeks. To their surprise, their creation gained traction among comic fans, leading to increased demand for subsequent issues. In the next couple of years, the TMNT comics garnered mainstream success, and the characters started getting featured on various merchandise. In 1987, following the success of the TMNT comics, a decision to create an animated TV series was made. The cartoon version featured an altered, lighter, and more humorous tone compared to the original darker and grittier comic books. The animated series first aired in December 1987 and was produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and MWS (later renamed to Fred Wolf Films), with Eastman and Laird acting as creative consultants. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the characters had become a global phenomenon, with toys, cartoons, movies, video games, and other merchandise flooding the market. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise has since evolved into a long-lasting cultural icon, with various iterations and adaptations in comics, television series, movies, and other media. However, its success and recognition can be traced back to the initial creative collaboration between Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, who dared to turn a casual, humorous drawing into a global entertainment sensation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous. - Manacus is a genus of passerine birds in the manakin family which are found in the forests of tropical mainland Central and South America , and on Trinidad and Tobago . There are four species . White - collared manakin , Manacus candei Orange - collared manakin , Manacus aurantiacus Golden - collared manakin , Manacus vitellinus White - bearded manakin , Manacus manacus The \`\` Almirante manakin '' ( Manacus x cerritus ) are stereotyped hybrids between the white - collared and the golden - collared species , found in Bocas del Toro Province , Panama ( Brumfield et al. , 2001 ; McDonald et al. , 2001 ) . These are small , compact , short - tailed birds with a heavy hooked bill and orange legs . The males have brightly coloured plumage and long puffed throat feathers , whereas the females are the typical manakin dull olive hue . The females lay two eggs in a shallow cup nest in a tree . Nest - building , incubation for 18 -- 21 days , and care of the young are undertaken by the female alone , since manakins do not form stable pairs . Manacus manakins feed low in the trees on fruit and some insects , both plucked from the foliage in flight . Like some other manakin species , this genus has spectacular courtship rituals , in which the males give communal displays in a specially prepared lek . The males jump with their throat feathers erected to form a beard , and give whistles together with the characteristic loud snaps ( like a breaking twig ) and various buzzing , rustling and whiffling noises made with the wings . The males of three very closely related species , the white - collared manakin of the Caribbean slopes of Central America , and its Pacific counterparts , the orange - collared and golden - collared manakins , have heavily modified wings with the five outer primaries very narrow for their outer half , and the inner primaries thickened and bowed . - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Brood parasites are organisms that rely on others to raise their young. The strategy appears among birds, insects and some fish. The brood parasite manipulates a host, either of the same or of another species, to raise its young as if it were its own. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The cuckoos are a family of birds, Cuculidae, the sole taxon in the order Cuculiformes. The cuckoo family includes the common or European cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. The coucals and anis are sometimes separated as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae respectively. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - The cuckoo-finch (\\"Anomalospiza imberbis\\"), also known as the parasitic weaver or cuckoo weaver, is a small passerine bird now placed in the family Viduidae with the indigobirds and whydahs. It occurs in grassland in Africa south of the Sahara. The male is mainly yellow and green while the female is buff with dark streaks. The eggs are laid in the nests of other birds. - Tobago is an autonomous island within the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is located northeast of the mainland of Trinidad and southeast of Grenada. The island lies outside the hurricane belt. According to the earliest English-language source cited in the \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\", Tobago bore a name that has become the English word \\"tobacco.\\" The national bird of Tobago is the cocrico. - Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus \\"Nicotiana\\" and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. While more than 70 species of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is \\"N. tabacum\\". The more potent variant \\"N. rustica\\" is also used around the world. - Shrikes are carnivorous passerine birds of the family Laniidae. The family is composed of thirty-one species in four genera. They are fairly closely related to the bush-shrike family Malaconotidae. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Cowbirds are birds belonging to the genus Molothrus in the family Icteridae. They are brood parasitic New World birds which are unrelated to the Old World cuckoos, one of which, the common cuckoo, is the most famous brood parasitic bird. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - Passer is a genus of sparrows, also known as the true sparrows. The genus includes the house sparrow and the Eurasian tree sparrow, some of the most common birds in the world. They are small birds with thick bills for eating seeds, and are mostly coloured grey or brown. Native to the Old World, some species have been introduced throughout the world. - The manakins are a clade (Pipridae) of small suboscine passerine birds. The group contains some 60 species distributed through the American tropics. The name is from Middle Dutch \\"mannekijn\\" \\"little man\\" (also the source of the different bird name \\"mannikin\\"). - Trinidad (Spanish: \\"Trinity\\") is the larger and more populous of the two major islands and numerous landforms which make up the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. The island lies off the northeastern coast of Venezuela and sits on the continental shelf of South America. Though geographically part of the South American continent, from a socio-economic standpoint it is often referred to as the southernmost island in the Caribbean. With an area of , it is also the sixth largest in the West Indies. - A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin \\"oscen\\", \\"a songbird\\". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The order Squamata, or the scaled reptiles, are the largest recent order of reptiles, comprising all lizards and snakes. With over 10,000 species, it is also the second-largest order of extant vertebrates, after the perciform fish, and roughly equal in number to the Saurischia (one of the 2 major groups of dinosaurs). Members of the order are distinguished by their skins, which bear horny scales or shields. They also possess movable quadrate bones, making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the neurocranium. This is particularly visible in snakes, which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey. They are the most variably sized order of reptiles, ranging from the dwarf gecko (\\"Sphaerodactylus ariasae\\") to the green anaconda (\\"Eunectes murinus\\") and the now-extinct mosasaurs, which reached lengths of . What is the relationship between 'manacus' and 'pipridae'? Answer:","completion":"Manacus is a genus of passerine birds that belongs to the family Pipridae. Passerine birds are known for their distinctive toe arrangement that facilitates perching, and they represent more than half of all bird species. Pipridae is a family of small suboscine passerine birds, commonly known as manakins. Manakins are primarily found in the forests of tropical mainland Central and South America, as well as Trinidad and Tobago. These birds have unique physical characteristics and exhibit spectacular courtship rituals. The relationship between Manacus and Pipridae is that Manacus is a genus within the Pipridae family. This means that Manacus is a group of species that share common traits and are closely related to each other, being classified under the larger family Pipridae. The Pipridae family, in turn, includes other genera of manakins, making Manacus a part of the diverse family of manakin birds. Overall, Manacus and Pipridae are connected through their taxonomic classification, where Manacus represents a specific genus of manakin birds within the broader family of Pipridae."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\". - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\"). - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903. - The Union Association was a league in Major League Baseball which lasted for only one season in 1884 . St. Louis won the pennant and joined the National League the following season . Chicago moved to Pittsburgh in late August , and four teams folded during the season and were replaced . Although the league is conventionally listed as a major league , this status has been questioned by a number of modern baseball historians , most notably Bill James in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract . The league had a number of major league players ( on the St. Louis franchise , at least ) , but the league 's overall talent and organization was notably inferior to that of the two established major leagues . James found that the contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league either . The earliest record he could find of the Union Association as a major league was Ernest Lanigan 's The Baseball Cyclopedia , published in 1922 . For example , the league 's only \`\` star '' player , Fred Dunlap , led the league in batting average with .412 ( 86 points higher than his second - best season and 120 points higher than his career average ) , on - base percentage , slugging percentage , runs scored , hits , total bases , and home runs ( with just 13 , typical for the era ) . After the league folded , Dunlap never hit more than .274 or more than 10 home runs until he retired in 1891 , another measure of the inferior quality of the Union Association . Of the 272 players in the Association , 107 ( 39.34 % ) never played in another major league , while 72 ( 26.47 % ) played very briefly ( less than 300 at bats and / or 50 hits ) in other major leagues , and 79 ( 29.04 % ) had longer careers but little success in other major leagues .

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. I am facing a new situation today: Mary and Ann are mother and daughter. Mary is in her 70's while Ann is in her late 40's. They both work out regularly for improved health. Mary has been experiencing some health issues lately. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person has a stronger immune system? A:","completion":"A: Based on the background article, it can be inferred that Ann, who is in her late 40s, likely has a stronger immune system compared to Mary, who is in her 70s. The article states that during late adulthood, there is a decline in the efficiency of a person's immune system, which makes them more susceptible to common diseases. This reduction in immune function can also lead to a more severe impact from illnesses like the flu and may even result in death. In comparison, an individual in their late 40s is not yet in the late adulthood stage and would typically exhibit a more robust immune system than someone in their 70s. While it is important to note that both Mary and Ann are engaging in regular physical activity to improve their health, age remains an influential factor in determining immune system strength. Therefore, considering age and the information presented in the background article, Ann likely has a stronger immune system than Mary. However, it is essential to remember that individual health circumstances may vary, and various factors contribute to the overall immune system strength in an individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. If more than one egg is artificially introduced into the fallopian tube by a fertility doctor, it can lead to multiple outcomes. Direct effects: 1. Increased chance of fertilization: With more eggs available, there is a higher likelihood of sperm meeting an egg and fertilizing it. 2. Multiple pregnancies: If more than one egg gets fertilized, it can result in multiple embryos, leading to twins, triplets, or higher-order multiples, depending on the number of fertilized eggs. Indirect effects: 1. Increased strain on the body: Multiple pregnancies can put additional strain on the woman's body, including her uterus, potentially leading to complications during pregnancy and delivery. 2. Health risks for the babies: Babies conceived through multiple pregnancies have a higher risk of being born prematurely and having low birth weight, which can lead to further health issues later in life. 3.

However, a luggage mix-up occurs, causing a woman named Mrs. Hess to inadvertently take the thieves' bag containing the remote control car while returning home to Chicago. The four thieves arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Hess's suburban neighborhood to find the chip. Meanwhile, Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Hess for shoveling snow, but she lectures him for scratching numerous itches.

Russ bought a telescope to view the planet but he couldn't see the star because the Choose your answer from: (A). star was closer.. (B). planet was closer..","completion":"Russ bought a telescope to view the planet but he couldn't see the star because the planet was closer. To better understand this situation, it is important to delve into the workings of a telescope and how celestial objects are observed through it. Telescopes are specialized pieces of optical equipment designed for magnifying and observing distant objects, such as celestial bodies, in the night sky. A key feature of a telescope is its ability to gather light, the more light it can collect, the better the image's detail and brightness. The primary component of a telescope is a lens or a mirror, which collects, focuses, and directs light toward the eyepiece where it can be observed or captured. The distance between celestial bodies can affect the capability of a telescope to see them clearly. In this case, the planet was closer to Russ's location than the star. This could have been the result of several factors that ultimately hindered his ability to see the star. Let's explore some of these possibilities. 1. Brightness and Magnitude: Planets can sometimes appear brighter and larger in a telescope than stars due to their relative proximity, which can make them easier to find and observe. As a result, planets can \\"overshadow\\" or mask the visibility of dimmer stars located near them. 2. Skyglow and Light Pollution: Artificial light from cities and towns can drown out the fainter light of distant stars, making them difficult or impossible to see with a telescope. Sky glow occurs when the sky appears to be brighter due to particles in the atmosphere scattering artificial light, making it more challenging to see distant stars, particularly those positioned near bright planets. 3. Telescope Limitations: Some telescopes may be better suited for specific types of observing, and the telescope Russ bought might not have been optimal for looking at the star he was interested in. Variables such as aperture size, focal length, and eyepiece selection can all influence what a telescope is best suited for viewing. 4. Atmospheric Effects: The Earth's atmosphere and changing weather conditions can hinder the visibility of celestial objects. Turbulence, humidity, and airborne particles can all have negative effects on the quality of the image formed in the telescope. While Russ was able to view the closer planet, he may still be able to find the star he wishes to observe by using a different approach. He can attempt to view the star on a night where the planet is no longer in proximity or not as visible, improve his viewing conditions by finding a location with less light pollution, or adapt his telescope setup to better suit his needs for star observing. In the future, Russ can also benefit from learning more about star charts, celestial coordinates, and understanding the best observing techniques for his specific telescope. With this knowledge, he can enhance his stargazing experience and potentially avoid the issue he encountered with the closer planet obstructing his view of the star."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For the people living in the Nile Basin,the river is their life. This 6,825 km waterway,whose watershed covers three million square kilometers,flows through mountains,woodlands,lakes and deserts. Its potential for fishing,tourism and shipping is great-but so are its challenges. Water shortage,already serious in Egypt and Sudan,will soon influence several other countries in the watershed as well. Today,about 160 million people depend on the Nile River for their living. Within the next 25 years,the district's population is expected to double,adding to the demand brought about by growth in industry and agriculture. The frequent drought adds to the urgency. Water quality is also a problem. Precious soil is washed out to sea. Wastes from industry and agriculture create pollution. Higher concentrations of salt influence irrigated soils. Water-borne diseases remain unchecked. In areas where it's hot and damp, _ grow so fast that they choke off lakes,dams and other sections of the river,making it difficult for fishing and other businesses to move forward. Native people along the narrow area of farmland have watched the sand move closer day by day. They've seen the river change course,and their only source of water thickened with mud. They're very poor and have few choices. But a new program,the Nile Basin Initiative(NBI),is offering very practical assistance. The program is more than just a water-management project. It's a plan for the social and economic development of a vast district: it concentrates on the needs of the poorest of the poor and the environment that supports them.

Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Casio Women's Watch Review: Wrist Band is a little small and this is coming from a person who has small wrists...It will work for now Answer: Answer:","completion":"After analyzing the given product review, one can conclude that the tone of the review is a mixture of both positive and negative sentiments. The title of the review, \\"Casio Women's Watch Review,\\" itself introduces the context of discussing a specific product, in this case, a Casio women's watch. The fact that the reviewer has taken the time to write a review indicates they have a certain level of engagement and interest in the product, which can be assumed as a subtle positive aspect. However, the tone becomes negative as the reviewer highlights one issue they experienced with the product, mentioning that \\"the wrist band is a little small.\\" The remark implies dissatisfaction and disappointment with the watch's wristband coming across as smaller than expected. This issue could potentially lessen the product's appeal to potential buyers, as it indicates a design or sizing concern. The reviewer further emphasizes the size problem by stating that they have small wrists themselves. With this detail, the reviewer establishes a point of comparison for the reader, making it easy for potential customers to understand the scope of the issue and how it might affect them. By comparing the product to their personal expectations and experiences, the reviewer indirectly exhibits dissatisfaction in a negative tone. However, the tone also shifts back to a mildly positive statement when the reviewer says, \\"It will work for now.\\" The phrase suggests a level of acceptance, as they are willing to continue using the product despite the concern mentioned earlier. This statement indicates that even though the wristband is smaller than expected, the watch is still usable and functional for the time being. It softens the negativity previously expressed and offers readers a balanced and humble perspective. In conclusion, the tone of this product review is a combination of both negative and positive sentiments. It starts with a neutral statement unveiling the product and then becomes negative as the reviewer points out an issue with the wristband's size. Subsequently, it shifts back to a mildly positive tone when the reviewer acknowledges the product's functionality. This mix of sentiments makes the review genuine and more relatable for potential customers and leaves them with a realistic expectation of the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Mrs. Henderson Presents Movie plot: The film is based on the true story of the Windmill Theatre in London. Eccentric 70-year-old widow Mrs Laura Henderson purchases it as a post-widowhood hobby and appoints autocratic manager Vivian Van Damm. In 1937, they start a continuous variety revue called \\"Revudeville\\", but after other theatres in London copy this innovation, they begin losing money. Mrs Henderson suggests they add female nudity, similar to the Moulin Rouge in Paris, which is unprecedented in the United Kingdom. The Lord Chamberlain (Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer) reluctantly allows this under the condition that the nude performers remain immobile, so the performances can be considered art, the equivalent of nude statues in museums. Because the theatre's auditorium is below street level it is relatively safe during the bombing of London, and performances continue. The performers bravely go on with the show even during frightening bombing raids, and the posed nude girls resume their poses, after ducking, as the whole theatre is shaken and the scene flats all round them sway when a bomb lands close by. Maureen, one of the cast, becomes involved at Mrs Henderson's instigation with a young soldier, one of the audience regulars. Maureen becomes pregnant, is very upset about how it will affect her life, and hands in her notice. However, before the issue can be resolved, she is killed by a bomb while leaving the theatre. Other scenes depict life in the theatre during the period. Mrs Henderson and Mr Van Damm frequently clash and squabble, but also show great appreciation for each other. Eventually, the authorities want the theatre to close because of the danger of crowds gathering in the street outside the theatre. However, Mrs Henderson successfully argues: for soldiers going to die in the war this is their last chance, and for many of the young soldiers their only chance, to see female nudity. She reflects on the death of her son in the First World War, and how he may never have even seen a naked girl outside of a French postcard he'd...

A Neanderthal man stumbles upon what appears to be a large, primal, vicious alien in a cave (although the camera work uses zooms and flash-edits to keep the creature from being visualized fully). The two fight, and the caveman wins, stabbing the alien to death. However, fans of the show will recognize the black oil as it bleeds from the alien's wounds and soaks into the Neanderthal. After a fade to modern-day small-town Texas, a little boy (Lucas Black) falls down a hole in his back yard, and finds a human skull. As he picks it up, black oil seeps out from the ground beneath his feet, and black slivers move up his legs until they reach his head - his eyes go black. Shortly afterward, a team of firemen descend to rescue him. They are presumably lost to the same fate as the boy.In the summer of 1998, at the end of the show's fifth season, the X-Files were shut down, and Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were assigned to other projects.

A: Answer:","completion":"Accessory digestive organs play a vital role in the process of breaking down food substances, enabling the body to extract essential nutrients and dispose of waste products effectively. These organs include the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, each contributing to different stages of digestion and absorption. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of each accessory organ's functionality and the substances they play a role in breaking down: 1. Salivary glands: The salivary glands are specialized exocrine glands located in the oral cavity, responsible for producing and secreting saliva. Saliva contains various enzymes and substances critical for breaking down food. The primary enzyme present in saliva is amylase, which breaks down complex carbohydrates, such as starch, into simpler sugars like maltose. Additionally, saliva provides lubrication to facilitate the swallowing of food and contains lysozyme, an enzyme that helps protect against bacterial infections in the oral cavity. 2. Liver: The liver is a vital organ responsible for producing bile, a greenish-yellow fluid that is critical for the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile consists of bile acids, which breakdown large fat globules into smaller droplets. These smaller droplets increase the surface area for lipase, a fat-digesting enzyme, allowing it to function more effectively. Moreover, the liver also has essential roles in processing and storing nutrients, detoxifying harmful substances, and synthesizing blood proteins. 3. Gallbladder: The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. It stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver before releasing it into the small intestine when required. The concentrated bile emulsifies fats in the small intestine, which is vital for their breakdown and efficient absorption. Essentially, the gallbladder's function is to regulate the release of bile and support the liver's role in fat digestion. 4. Pancreas: The pancreas is a multifunctional organ that secretes pancreatic juice, containing digestive enzymes and bicarbonate ions. Pancreatic amylase is responsible for breaking down carbohydrates into disaccharides, trypsin, and chymotrypsin for breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, and lipase for breaking down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Additionally, the pancreas produces hormones like insulin and glucagon, both of which are vital for regulating blood sugar levels. In summary, accessory digestive organs like the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas produce and secrete substances that are critical for breaking down various food components. These components include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, enabling the body to utilize essential nutrients effectively and eliminate waste products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Federalism: In modern times, a process of devolution in the United Kingdom has decentralised power once again. Since the 1997 referendums in Scotland and Wales and the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, three of the four constituent countries of the UK now have some level of autonomy. Government has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. England does not have its own parliament and English affairs continue to be decided by the Westminster Parliament. In 1998 a set of eight unelected Regional assemblies, or chambers, was created to support the English Regional Development Agencies, but these were abolished between 2008 and 2010. The Regions of England continue to be used in certain governmental administrative functions. What does the region of England continue to use?","completion":"The region of England continues to use the \\"Regions of England\\" as a structure for certain governmental administrative functions. Following the abolishment of the eight unelected Regional Assemblies (or chambers) between 2008 and 2010, the regions themselves have persisted as a means of organizing various administrative tasks at a more local level within England. These Regions of England, also sometimes referred to as \\"Government Office Regions,\\" serve as an organizational framework for coordinating various government programs and initiatives within specific geographic areas. Although the Regional Assemblies no longer exist, the regions still play an important role in various aspects of governance and administration, such as regional planning, implementing national policies at a local level, and coordinating responses to issues that impact the regions. The current Regions of England include: 1. North East England 2. North West England 3. Yorkshire and the Humber 4. East Midlands 5. West Midlands 6. East of England 7. London 8. South East England 9. South West England By compartmentalizing England into these regions, the government can better address the specific needs and requirements of each area. This helps to facilitate a more efficient allocation of resources and ensures that local matters are dealt with more effectively. It is important to note that while these Regions of England are used for administrative purposes, they do not possess the same level of autonomy as the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In England, decision-making power predominantly remains with the UK Parliament in Westminster. However, the persistence of these regions signifies an ongoing recognition of the importance of addressing regional needs and facilitating more localized governance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Proposition Movie plot: Set in the Australian outback in the 1880s, the movie follows the series of events following the horrific rape and murder of the Hopkins family, allegedly committed by the infamous Burns brothers gang.The film opens in a brothel during a violent gunfight between the police and Charlie Burns' (Guy Pearce) gang, which ends with the deaths of all of the gang members except for Charlie and his younger brother Mikey. Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \\"The Dog Man\\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence (Robert Morgan), causing disgust among the townspeople.Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes that Mikey is innocent and the flogging will surely kill him, but because it would also break his deal with Charlie and... A:","completion":"Based on the movie plot summary provided for \\"The Proposition,\\" Sergeant Lawrence, played by Robert Morgan, seems to function as part of the police force under Captain Stanley. However, the military rank of Lawrence is not explicitly provided in the given information. To dive deeper into the historical context, in the 1880s in Australia, the police force and military were interconnected in some aspects. In a frontier setting like the Australian outback, the frameworks of policing and military often overlapped. Roles like Lawrence's were crucial in maintaining law and order in these harsh and difficult environments. Lawrence is depicted as a corrupt subordinate to Captain Stanley, but his exact role within the law enforcement structure is not clear. Often, these frontier forces were a mix of military officers, enlisted men, and locally hired hands. His title, \\"Sergeant,\\" is commonly associated with both police and military ranks, denoting a position of authority and responsibility. Regardless, the movie paints a morally complex picture, where the pursuit of justice often blends with personal desires and corrupt practices. As an investor, you might be particularly interested in how well this character, Sergeant Lawrence, embodies these complexities of frontier law enforcement - a critical part in creating a captivating narrative. Nonetheless, to obtain detailed information regarding Lawrence's military position, additional data or access to the complete script might be required. Remember that understanding the roles and relationships of characters is crucial when evaluating a film's potential for success, as it directly relates to the narrative's depth, complexity, and appeal to audiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now weary of battle, Maximus only desires to retire to his Spanish farm estate. But Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells him that his own son and heir, Commodus, is unfit to rule and appoints Maximus as regent to help save Rome from corruption. When the emperor reveals his plan to his son, Commodus murders him in a fit of rage. Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty. When the general refuses, he is arrested by his officers and is sentenced to death at dawn. He kills his captors and rides for his farm. However, he arrives too late to find it destroyed and his family murdered, under Commodus' orders. Maximus buries them and collapses from his wounds and grief. He is found by slavers who take him to Zucchabar, a colonia in the Roman North African province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to a lanista (gladiator trainer) named Proximo. Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other gladiators named Juba, a Numidian, and Hagan, a German. As he wins every match because of his military skills and indifference to death, he gains fame and recognition. But Proximo, who reveals that he himself was once a gladiator who fought well enough to be given his freedom, advises Maximus that being a good killer is not enough; a good gladiator is one who can \\"win the crowd\\". Proximo encourages Maximus to go to Rome and fight in the Colosseum because Commodus has organized 150 days of games. He could then use the power he commands in the arena as leverage against the Emperor. Maximus' first gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum is a re-enactment of the Roman victory over Carthage at the Battle of Zama.

However, when Perry's hovercraft accidentally collides with their shuttlecock, the boys crash into Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's laboratory and destroy his \\"Other-Dimension-Inator\\", which is designed to help him travel to parallel dimensions. Intrigued by the idea, the two help Doofenshmirtz rebuild the machine, while Perry arrives on his mission to stop Doofenshmirtz. Unwilling to give away his secret identity to the boys (which would get him relocated to another family), Perry reverts to his pet mode and is forced to watch them help Doofenshmirtz activate his invention. The group is transported to an alternate dimension where a second, truly intelligent and evil Doofenshmirtz rules over his Tri-State Area.

When the boys arrive with Perry to Doofenshmirtz-2's office, Doof-2 recognizes Perry as a secret agent and orders Platyborg to attack Perry. When that doesn't affect him, Doofenshmirtz-2 orders Platyborg to attack the boys next, which forces Perry to reveal his secret identity to stop Platyborg from doing so, much to the others' shock. Doofenshmirtz-2 then sends several of his Norm Bots to catch Perry and the boys, but the trio escapes. Afterwards, Phineas expresses his anger at Perry for using him and Ferb as a cover for his double life.

The reviewer starts off the title with \\"Great Movie,\\" which indicates a positive sentiment towards the film. 2. In the body of their review, they state: \\"Love this movie and had it on DVD.\\" The use of the term \\"love\\" again demonstrates their affection and positive feelings towards the movie. 3. Despite mentioning the absence of a particular song (Kelly Clarkson's \\"The Trouble with Love\\") in the Blu-ray version compared to the original DVD, the reviewer explicitly mentions that it is \\"still a great movie\\" regardless of this difference. This shows that although they might find this change somewhat disappointing, it does not affect their overall enjoyment and favorable opinion of the film. 4. The mention of \\"kinda weird\\" might be seen as a slightly negative or neutral point at most, but is not significant enough to change the overall positive sentiment. Therefore, given these observations, the product review is predominantly positive in nature and showcases the reviewer's satisfaction and contentment with the movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. You are given a new situation: Belgium and France are two countries participating at a human health meeting. Belgium has a lower biodiversity, while France's biodiversity is much higher. and a hint : Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market... Please answer this question : Which country caused more climate change? Answer:","completion":"It is not possible to determine which country, Belgium or France, caused more climate change based solely on the information provided about their biodiversity levels. Climate change is a multifaceted issue influenced by various factors, such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and industrial activities. While biodiversity loss can be a consequence and indicator of climate change, it is not the sole determining factor. To accurately assess which country has contributed more to climate change, we would need more information, including data on their carbon footprints, energy policies, and efforts to mitigate climate change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If little things are bothering you and you shove them down, they are just going to turn into an explosion at a bad time. If you deal with them as they happen, it won't be as big of a deal. If you find yourself starting a discussion while angry or getting angry while in the middle of a discussion, you may need to spend some time calming down. You know what calms you down. Maybe you need to take a short walk, listen to some music, or take a relaxing shower. You can also try counting to ten or taking a few deep breathes. Whatever you need to do, take a few minutes to calm down before continuing the discussion. Look for warning signs. If you find yourself feeling like you absolutely must win an argument, it's time to take a break. At that point, you're likely to say something you regret or keep the argument going long past the point that it's wise to do so. When you're angry, you're just thinking about how you've been wronged. However, as soon as you start forcing yourself to think about what the other person is going through, you start to pull yourself out of that mindset. Being empathetic can help drain your anger. It's important to respect what your partner is feeling, as he or she has a right to feel and express his or her emotions, whatever they are. Whether or not you think your partner is right about the problem, you should still validate what the person is feeling. Listening to what the other person has to say can help you develop empathy for what he or she is feeling. Don't just let the words pass over you. Actually think about what the person is saying, and maybe try to understand what is behind the words, as well. One way to show you are listening is to try to summarize what the other person is saying. For example, you can say, \\"What I hear you saying is you get frustrated when you do more than your share of the housework.\\" Another way to show you're listening is to ask relevant follow-up questions to make sure you understand what the other person is saying. You also have a right to discuss what you're feeling and thinking. The key is to keep a calm head. It's also important to be clear about what you're thinking and feeling. You can't expect your partner to read your mind when it comes to your thoughts and emotions. Keep to talking about what you think about the problem, rather than placing blame. In other words, start with \\"I\\" instead of \\"You.\\" For instance, you could say \\"I get anxious when the house isn't clean. Can we work on making a schedule for house cleaning so we can stay on top of it?\\" instead of \\"You never clean house with me!\\" The key to any relationship is learning to compromise. You can't just expect to win every argument, as relationships involve give and take. Compromising is about finding common ground and both of you giving a little on the issue. Discuss your needs and wants. If you can decide on what both you need, you can give a little in the \\"wants\\" section. Basically, you need to decide what areas are least and most important to you and learn to give in the areas that aren't as important. If you hate cleaning the bathroom but your spouse wants you to help out around the house more, maybe you can divide chores into ones you find more tolerable and ones he or she finds more tolerable. When you're arguing, it's tempting to name-call or make unfair remarks that drag up the past. You know how to push your partner's buttons because you know him or her so well. However, all that will serve to do is make everyone angrier, and may even damage the relationship irrevocably. Keep to the task at hand.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A Terrorism Case in Britain Ends in Acquittal, but No One Can Say Why LONDON — Ian Cobain, a reporter with The Guardian, is one of very few people who know why a student arrested by armed British police officers in 2013 was finally acquitted this year of terrorism charges. Problem is, he cannot report what he knows. He was allowed to observe much of the trial, but only under strict conditions intended to keep classified material secret. His notebooks are being held by Britain’s domestic intelligence agency. And if he writes — or even talks — about the reason that the student, Erol Incedal, 27, was acquitted, Mr. Cobain faces prosecution and possibly jail. “I know the essence of what was happening,” Mr. Cobain said, “but I can’t tell, I can’t even talk to my editor about this.” Having initially gone along reluctantly with the reporting restrictions, a number of British news organizations are now challenging them in court. And yes, the challenge itself is being heard under secrecy rules that leave the public mostly excluded. Were Mr. Cobain to break the law and disclose what he knows publicly, his prosecution would also take place in secret. “Not even the Russians do that to journalists,” Mr. Cobain said, speaking recently in the cafe of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The case is among the latest to highlight the growing debate about the proper balance between civil liberties and national security in the age of terrorism. That debate has intensified this year in the United States and across much of Europe, with nations reflecting on decisions they have made since the Sept. 11 attacks and reacting to more recent developments, from the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris to disclosures in Germany about eavesdropping by the United States National Security Agency. In Britain, which recently lost 30 citizens to a terrorist attack in Tunisia, public support for the intelligence and security agencies is high, according to opinion surveys, and Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to expand their resources and their ability to monitor electronic communications. But the Incedal case has focused attention on whether governments are cloaking too many of their activities in national security classifications, insulating themselves from public debate and accountability for mistakes or collusion with suspects. “It’s hard to know quite who is being protected in all this,” said David Davis, a lawmaker from the governing Conservative Party and a former minister. “The implication is that this is more about the embarrassment of the agencies than it is about real questions of national security,” he added. Sean O’Neill, a reporter with The Times of London who also attended the secret hearings, said he believes that the government’s desire to keep some of the trial evidence secret was legitimate, but that this could have been done under normal rules allowing parts of trials to be held behind closed doors. Instead, the conduct of the Incedal case demonstrated an “obsession with secrecy” at a time when there is growing debate on the oversight of intelligence agencies, Mr. O’Neill said. “There is a refusenik factor in these organizations which thinks ‘anything we give will undermine us, and therefore undermine national security,’ ” he said. The result is that, as things stand, public knowledge about one of Britain’s biggest recent terrorism trials is a patchwork of partial truths and unanswered questions. In the parts of the proceedings that were open, jurors heard that Mr. Incedal traveled to Syria, met a fighter known as Ahmed and discussed terrorist attacks. In September 2013, Mr. Incedal, who was born in Turkey but lived in London, was stopped by the police for speeding, and his car was searched. A slip of paper found in a glasses case contained the address of a property owned by Tony Blair, a former prime minister. While he was detained, Mr. Incedal’s car was bugged, and a listening device recorded him talking about buying a gun. Then came the dramatic arrest by armed police officers when Mr. Incedal was stopped while driving with a friend, Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, near Tower Bridge in central London, and the tires of his Mercedes were shot out. The police found a memory card with instructions on assembling a bomb in Mr. Incedal’s phone case. After his first trial last year, Mr. Incedal was convicted of possessing the bomb-making guide, and was sentenced to 42 months in jail. Mr. Rarmoul-Bouhadjar was jailed, too, after admitting to having a similar manual. But a jury could not agree on whether to convict Mr. Incedal of broader terrorism offenses. After a retrial, Mr. Incedal was acquitted in March, but the reasons remain unknown to the public. Mr. Incedal argued in open court that he wanted a gun to protect himself as he was planning to deal in drugs, and that he had a “reasonable excuse” for having the bomb-making manual. Again, what that excuse was is not clear. Even these scraps of information are more than the authorities wanted made public. Initially, prosecutors argued that they might not be able to bring the case to court unless it was held in complete secrecy. But after an appeal by news organizations last year, a strange middle way emerged: Some of the trial was held in public, some in secret, and the rest in a kind of no man’s land. Ten reporters, including Mr. Cobain and Mr. O’Neill, were admitted to these segments of the trial on the condition that they published nothing from the semi-secret sessions and that, at the end of each day, their reporters’ notebooks were locked in a safe. The notebooks are now being held by MI5, Britain’s domestic intelligence service — a fact that has been reported by the British news media and is not denied by the government, although it will not comment officially. In going along with the reporting restrictions a year ago, the 10 news organizations accredited to the trial may have believed — incorrectly as it proved — that the secrecy would be lifted at the end of proceedings. Although not all of the news organizations covered every phase of the trial, no media group refused to attend on principle. Mr. Cobain says he now has “real reservations” about having gone along with the process, but, of course, cannot explain why. In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said that the case “touched on important issues which related to national security.” “Some evidence has already been made public as it was dealt with in open court,” the statement said. “We are working to identify evidence heard during the closed proceedings which could be placed in the public domain.” “The extent to which further evidence can go into the public domain will ultimately be a decision for the judge.” Many are not convinced. “How is the public to evaluate the state’s actions if the media cannot report on it?” said Cian C. Murphy, a legal expert at King’s College London. “In constitutional terms, secrecy is anathema to the rule of law because legal and political accountability is impossible without transparency,” he said. “If errors are made, they must be brought to light — but there is little incentive for the prosecution, intelligence agencies or government departments to acquiesce when they can invoke national security to ensure secrecy.” Critics contend that such secrecy risks eroding not only civil liberties, but ultimately the effectiveness of the intelligence agencies, too. “The more secret the organization is, the more inefficient it tends to be,” Mr. Davis said. “It’s unwise to think of them as a bunch of hyperefficient James Bonds. They probably aren’t.” “The truth is,” he added, “that there is no such thing as secret justice. If it’s secret, it’s not justice.” The appeal against the reporting restrictions has now been adjourned until the autumn, but in one public session this month, Lord Chief Justice John Thomas acknowledged that there were “really difficult constitutional issues” at stake. A few minutes later, those reporters without special permission to attend were politely asked to leave.

The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of Alexander Pushkin (Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called \\"высо́кий стиль\\" — \\"high style\\") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов), Nikolai Gogol (Никола́й Го́голь), Aleksander Griboyedov (Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech. What happened to some expressions in Pushkin's writing?","completion":"Some expressions from Pushkin's writing, as well as those of other Russian writers from the early 19th century such as Nikolai Gogol, Aleksander Griboyedov and Mikhail Lermontov, became proverbs or sayings. These expressions have been integrated into modern Russian colloquial speech and can still be frequently found today. Despite the passage of time and changes in the language, these remnants of Pushkin's transformative approach to Russian literature have endured. The reason is likely because he favored the use of grammar and vocabulary from the spoken language of the time, which likely facilitated their adoption into everyday language and their continued relevance. As a result, expressions that originated in the literary works of these writers have remained part of the living language, rather than becoming archaic or obsolete."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

There are all these torrents of passion flowing through you. Your job, as captain of your soul, is to erect dams to keep these passions in check. Your job is to just say no to laziness, lust, greed, drug use and the other sins. These days that model is out of fashion. You usually can't change your behavior by simply resolving to do something. Knowing what to do is not the same as being able to do it. Your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It's more like a muscle, which tires easily. Moreover, you're a social being. If everybody around you is overeating, you'll probably do so, too. The 19th-century character model was based on an understanding of free will. Today, we know that free will is bounded. People can change their lives, but ordering change is not simple because many things, even within ourselves, are beyond our direct control. Much of our behavior, for example, is guided by unconscious habits. Researchers at Duke University calculated that more than 40 percent of the actions we take are governed by habit, not actual decisions. Researchers have also come to understand the structure of habits--cue, routine, reward. You can change your own personal habits. If you leave running shorts on the floor at night, that'll be a cue to go running in the morning. Don't try to ignore your afternoon snack craving. Every time you feel the cue for a snack, insert another routine. Take a walk. Their research thus implies a different character model, which is supposed to manipulate the neuralnetworks inside. To be an effective person, under this model, you are supposed to coolly examine your own unconscious habits, and the habits of those under your care. You are supposed to devise strategies to alter the cues and routines. Every relationship becomes slightly manipulative, including your relationship with yourself. You're trying to arouse certain responses by implanting certain cues. This is a bit...

Dr. Benjamin Stone is a hotshot young surgeon who longs to leave the drudgery of a Washington , D.C. emergency room and finally leaps at his chance at more money and less death as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills . On his last day , Ben's relationship with his co-workers is presumed to be anything but a warm one . None of his colleagues will join him for a drink and a cake in his honor has an iced portion of the phrase \`\` Good riddance , asshole '' sliced out . Ben's cross-country drive in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster is interrupted when he crashes in the rural hamlet of Grady , South Carolina . The crash damages the fence of local Judge Evans , who sentences him to community service at a nearby hospital . Ben offers to pay for the fence , but the stern judge increases his community service each time he talks back . Defeated , he reports to the hospital , where Nurse Packer humbles him by ordering him to clock in and out , as would a factory worker . Though upset , Ben quickly makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson , the town cafe's proprietor/head waitress , and Melvin , the local mechanic tasked with repairing Ben's car . Ben soon finds his clinic work to be much more laid-back than the emergency room .

Webster Thursday, April 7, 2011 12:49 EDT A new poll out of Mississippi finds that in a bastion of America’s south, many Republican voters have tightly held onto the old, hateful views of race as a dividing line in society. A full 46 percent of Mississippi Republicans said they believe interracial marriage should be illegal, according to the left-leaning survey group Public Policy Polling. Only 40 percent said they thought it should remain legal, with the rest unsure. Republicans who said they were in favor of banning interracial marriages were most frequently supporters of Fox News contributor Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor (R) who quit half-way through her first term. Their least liked candidate was Mitt Romney, the former radio executive and Governor of Massachusetts (R). Romney, Palin and Fox News employee Mike Huckabee are widely considered to be the top three most likely Republican front-runners. None of them have officially announced their candidacy. The poll found that overall, Mississippi Republicans want Gov. Haley Barbour as their nominee over other potential candidates. Barbour won 37 percent of the survey’s respondents, compared to 19 percent for Huckabee and 10 percent for former Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich, the one-time Republican Speaker of the House. Barbour’s popularity may have something to do with the mentality of his constituency in Mississippi. For instance, in a state where almost half of the Republicans believe interracial marriage should be illegal, Barbour has praised a civil rights-era group that fought against segregation and refused to denounce an effort to get a state license plate to honor a former leader of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan terrorist group. Barbour was most recently in the headlines after it was revealed that he spent over 300,000 on out-of-state travel in 2010, campaigning with fellow Republicans and meeting with wealthy benefactors.

State media reported one more death. At least 16 people were killed when Manuel, downgraded later to a tropical depression, hit the Pacific coastal state of Guerrero, including a group of six tourists from Mexico City who died in a highway accident Saturday as the storm struck, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency said. And flooding and mudslides caused by Hurricane Ingrid's rains killed at least six people in the states of Hidalgo and Puebla, Notimex said. Three people were killed when rains swept away the vehicle they were riding in, Notimex said Saturday. And three others were killed when a mudslide buried a house. Luis Felipe Puente, from Mexico's civil protection agency, reported the 21 figure at a Sunday press conference. Another news conference is scheduled for Monday morning. Forecasters said the Category 1 hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, is expected to make landfall Monday morning and could strengthen slightly before it hits. But even as Ingrid churned in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm system was already dumping heavy rains on parts of Mexico.

For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. Now, I have a new situation: David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D.

Context: Jaime Federico Said Camil Saldaña da Gama (born 22 July 1973), known professionally as Jaime Camil, is a Mexican actor, singer and host. He is best known for his roles as Fernando Mendiola in \\"La Fea Mas Bella\\" and Rogelio de la Vega in \\"Jane the Virgin.\\" Hypothesis: Fernando Mendiola is the most famous latino character.","completion":"Drawing the hypothesis that \\"Fernando Mendiola is the most famous latino character\\" from the given context would not be appropriate, as there is not enough information provided to determine the character's overall fame within the Latino community or in comparison to other Latino characters. To examine the validity of this hypothesis, we need to explore several factors, such as the popularity of the character, the cultural impact of the character, and the role this character plays within the entertainment industry. 1. Popularity of the character: The context mentions that Jaime Camil is \\"best known\\" for his roles as Fernando Mendiola in \\"La Fea Mas Bella\\" and Rogelio de la Vega in \\"Jane the Virgin.\\" This suggests that these are two very significant roles in Camil's career, but it does not necessarily confirm that Fernando Mendiola is the most famous Latino character. We would need to gather more data on consumption metrics, such as television ratings, streaming numbers, and overall viewership, to compare the popularity of Fernando Mendiola with other well-known Latino characters. 2. Cultural impact of the character: To determine the impact of Fernando Mendiola on Latino culture, we would need to investigate the character's influence on viewers and how the character has been received by critics and fans alike. Public opinion, critical acclaim, or recognition through awards could provide insights into how Fernando Mendiola has impacted and resonated with audiences. Evaluating interviews, articles, and fan responses would also contribute to understanding the character's cultural impact and help us compare it to other Latino characters. 3. Role within the entertainment industry: Comparing Fernando Mendiola's presence within the entertainment industry to other Latino characters is essential in understanding the character's overall fame. This analysis entails examining the longevity and prominence of the character in the television industry, the relevance of the show \\"La Fea Mas Bella\\" in relation to other popular Latino shows, and the international success of the character, like in different countries and markets. We would need to gather data on the presence and achievements of various Latino characters in the entertainment industry and compare them to Fernando Mendiola's role to support or refute the hypothesis properly. In conclusion, while Jaime Camil's portrayal of Fernando Mendiola in \\"La Fea Mas Bella\\" is one of his best-known roles, there is not enough information in the given context to support the hypothesis that Fernando Mendiola is the most famous Latino character. Further investigation and data collection would be required to analyze the character's popularity, cultural impact, and presence within the entertainment industry in comparison to other Latino characters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. After reading the above, is \\"Steve Wynn\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who owned the Golden Nugget and Silver Slipper?\\"?

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Mozart children were not alone as 18th-century music prodigies. Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \\"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down\\".

The band consisted of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. NME named the Smiths the \\"most influential artist ever\\" in a 2002 poll. Context: The band next approached the record company EMI for a contract, but were turned down. Morrissey and Marr subsequently visited London to hand a cassette of their recordings to Geoff Travis of the independent record label Rough Trade Records. Although not signing them to a contract straight away, he agreed to cut their song \\"Hand in Glove\\" as a single. Morrissey insisted that the cover image on the single was a homoerotic photograph by Jim French which he had found in Margaret Walters' The Nude Male. The single was released in May 1983, and would sell well for the next 18 months although never made it into the UK Top 40. This coincided with the band's second gig in London, at the University of London Union. Present at the gig was John Walters, the producer of John Peel's Radio 1 show; interested, he invited the band to record a session for the programme. Peel expressed the view that \\"I was impressed because unlike most bands... you couldn't immediately tell what records they'd been listening to. That's fairly unusual, very rare indeed... It was that aspect of the Smiths that I found most impressive.\\" Following this radio exposure, the band gained their first interviews, in music magazines NME and Sounds. The Smiths then agreed to sign a record contract with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract. Only Morrissey and Marr signed it on behalf of the band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided up, something that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case. To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in Troy Tate of The Teardrop Explodes, and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, at the Elephant Studios in Wapping, East London. Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, John Porter. The band soon generated controversy when Gary Bushell of The Sun tabloid alleged that their B-side \\"Handsome Devil\\" was an endorsement of paedophilia. The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song \\"has nothing to do with children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting\\". The follow-up singles \\"This Charming Man\\" and \\"What Difference Does It Make?\\" fared better when they reached numbers 25 and 12 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. Aided by praise from the music press and a series of studio sessions for Peel and David Jensen at BBC Radio 1, the Smiths began to acquire a dedicated fan base. Question: Did they end up redoing it? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the Smiths ended up redoing their first album as Rough Trade was unhappy with the initial recording produced under the supervision of Troy Tate. To address this issue, Rough Trade brought in John Porter as a new producer for the album. Under Porter's direction, the band re-recorded the album, which was eventually released as their debut album titled \\"The Smiths\\" in 1984. The album received critical acclaim and helped solidify the Smiths' growing reputation in the British independent music scene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Galatasaray, for example, offers instruction in French; other Anatolian High Schools primarily teach in English or German alongside Turkish. The city also has foreign high schools, such as Liceo Italiano, that were established in the 19th century to educate foreigners.Kuleli Military High School, along the shores of the Bosphorus in Çengelköy, and Turkish Naval High School, on one of the Princes' Islands, were military high schools, complemented by three military academies—the Turkish Air Force, Turkish Military, and Turkish Naval Academies.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If a star has less mass, it will indeed affect its transformation and can lead it to become a smaller red giant. This factor directly impacts a step of the process. In the early life of a star, it burns hydrogen in its core, which forms helium. After the hydrogen fuel in the core is exhausted, the star evolves into a red giant. The size of a red giant depends on the initial mass of the star. If the initial stellar mass is lower, the resulting red giant will be smaller. During the red giant phase, the star burns helium into heavier elements, and the core contracts under gravity and heats up. If the star doesn't have enough mass to generate the extreme temperatures and pressures needed to burn carbon (approximately 1 billion K and pressures hundred times that of the Earth's core), it will not be able to proceed through the next phase of stellar evolution. Consequently, it will shed its outer layers and leave behind a core, forming a smaller white dwarf. To summarize, a star with less mass will directly impact the process by resulting in a smaller red giant. This will further influence subsequent steps of the process, making the evolution path of smaller stars different from larger ones. In the end, lower mass stars do not go through core-collapse, and instead form white dwarfs directly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you leave your phone lying around when you leave the room, chances are your partner will take the opportunity to snoop through your texts, emails and internet searches. According to a new survey, four in ten adults regularly check their partner's device behind their back to keep an eye on them - with women most likely to snoop. The fairer sex is also the most suspicious with 44 per cent of women admitting to checking their other halves' phones compared to 36 per cent of men. Six in 10 snoops have caught their partner cheating on them or talking to someone they shouldn't be. Researchers also found 34 per cent know their partner's mobile PIN, 39 per cent know their email account password and 26 per cent know their Facebook password. Some 31 per cent don't know their significant other's PINS or passwords and are happy with that but more than half (54 per cent) would be suspicious if this wasn't the case for them. In fact, just over half believe sharing your mobile PIN or social media passwords is a modern sign of true love and commitment. While six in 10 snoops have caught their partner cheating on them or talking to someone they shouldn't be, more than a third have scuppered a romantic surprise their loved one was planning. The study of 2,000 Britons, commissioned by Samsung, found almost half have gone through a partner's phone in at least one relationship they've been in, with 16 per cent admitting they have done this with pretty much everyone they have been with. Furthermore, 40 per cent regularly snoop through their current partner's mobile to keep an eye on what they are doing or who they are talking to. Women are the most likely to check a partner's phone compared to men, with 44 per cent admitting to it. It doesn't always go to plan though as 34 per cent have ended up ruining a surprise their partner is planning for them, stumbling across their plans for a holiday, weekend away, gift or even a proposal, plus 44 per cent of said snoops have been caught in the act when going through their partner's phone. Text messages are most likely to be checked, followed by their call history, Facebook private messages, emails and even their photo gallery. Internet history and Twitter conversations are also among the things looked at by suspicious people. 1. Text messages. 2. Call history. 3. Facebook private messages. 4. Emails. 5. Photo gallery. 6. Internet history. 7. WhatsApp history. 8. Twitter private messages. 9. Viber history. 10. Skype history. But six in 10 of those who snoop have found inappropriate text messages, Facebook messages, phone calls or internet searches on at least one of their partner's mobiles. When it comes to confessing about their find, 32 per cent would confront their other half even if it meant owning up to their snooping, while a clever 18 per cent would find a way to bring it up without having to admit how they found out. Whilst 23 per cent would keep it to themselves, but keep a closer eye on their partner, 17 per cent would try and forget about it as they shouldn't have been snooping in the first place. Almost one in 20 would break up with their partner immediately. While 27 per cent said their other half wasn't bothered, as they had nothing to hide, 40 per cent said they were angry and 24 per cent said they broke up with them there and then. The phone company commissioned the research for the new Samsung Galaxy A-Series smartphone range. A spokesperson for Samsung Electronics UK & Ireland said:. 'Rather amusingly this research shows that suspicious partners seem to be using them quite regularly to check up on their other half on a regular basis. 'As we head towards the Valentine's season however, it's worth bearing in mind that you might discover something your partner is trying to keep hidden for all the right reasons, such as a secret weekend away they are planning, a special gift or perhaps even a marriage proposal!'

Esma Redzepova-Teodosievska (Macedonian: Esma Redzhepova-Teodosievska Macedonian pronunciation: ['esma re'dZepova teo'dosiefska]; 8 August 1943 - 11 December 2016) was a Macedonian vocalist, songwriter, and humanitarian of Romani ethnicity. Because of her prolific repertoire, which includes hundreds of songs, and because of her contribution to Roma culture and its promotion, she was nicknamed Queen of the Gypsies. In 1956, Esma's headteacher suggested she sing at a school talent contest for Radio Skopje. She went there without telling her parents, who did not want her to follow the path of an older sister who started to sing in cafes at 17. Among Roma people, such a career was viewed as shameful for an unmarried girl. Esma performed A bre babi, a Macedonian Roma traditional song. It was the first time a song in Romani was aired by the station. Esma won the contest, beating 57 other schools and winning 9,000 dinars. When Esma's parents learned about her success, they were extremely upset and reluctant to let her follow a musical career. At that time, the only possible career for Roma singers was to perform in cafes and restaurants with no other prospect. Stevo Teodosievski, an ethnic Macedonian musician and band frontman, was impressed by Esma's performance at the contest and wanted her to join his musical ensemble. Teodosievski was a self-taught man coming from a poor background, leading a large folk ensemble, the Ansambl Teodosievski. He also worked for Radio Skopje and was a member of the League of Communists of Macedonia. Being part of the local establishment, Teodosievski was also a visionary because he believed that Roma music could become esteemed and popular among non-Romani people. Indeed, at that time, Roma music in Yugoslavia was depreciated and not considered suitable for radio or television. Furthermore, racism against Roma people was very common in Macedonia and the rest of Yugoslavia and Roma people themselves had a poor image of Roma singers, especially female ones. Before Esma, Roma performers never sang in Romani on radio or television and always hid their origins. Teodosievski had been promoting Roma music even before meeting Redzepova and had faced severe criticism from the media for doing so. He knew however that Esma Redzepova could help him achieve his goal and that she could easily become one of the most prominent artists in the country. He convinced Esma's parents to let her go with him and join his ensemble. They both promised that Esma would only sing on reputable scenes. When they met in Skopje, Stevo Teodosievski was not fully satisfied with Esma's voice, and encouraged her to train for long hours. He enrolled her at the Academy of Music in Belgrade, where she stayed for two years.

Meanwhile, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the \\"Lost Girl\\", cries while watching television in a hotel room, following an unpleasant encounter with her client. The Lost Girlâs television displays a family of surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are laugh track responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout Inland Empire.The main plot follows an actress named Nikki Grace (Dern), who has applied for a comeback role as Sue in a film entitled On High in Blue Tomorrows. The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman (Zabriskie) who says she is her neighbor; she predicts that Nikki will get the role, and recounts two folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, \\"caused evil to be born.\\" The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, \\"discovers a palace.\\" The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. Disregarding Nikki's offended response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbor is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler (Ian Abercrombie) walks into the living room with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek (Peter J. Lucas) ominously surveys them from atop a nearby staircase.Some time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk (Theroux) receive an interview on a talk show. The host (Ladd) asks them both whether they are having an affair, to which each of them respond negatively. Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds, due to her husband's power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director, Kingsley Stewart (Irons). They are interrupted by a disturbance, but upon investigation Devon finds nothing. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled 47. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.Immersed in her character, while the film is being shot, \\"Sue\\" / Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon / \\"Billy\\". A strange scene follows based on what the old woman had described: Nikki appears in a mysterious alley walking to her car, carrying a bag of groceries, but then she notices a door in the alley marked Axxon N, and enters. It leads her back to soundstage where the earlier rehearsal took place. She witnesses that rehearsal from across the roomââshe herself was what had interrupted it earlier. This time, when Devon seeks to discover who's observing them, she disappears from the rehearsal scene, and flees among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of a character named Smithy (possibly her husband in the film's story, but this is never made clear). Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness, not hearing her frantic cries of his character's name, \\"Billy.\\"At this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband (whether it's \\"Smithy\\" or Piotrek is unclear) in bed. Hiding from him, she enters a different room and encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings, many of which seem to revolve around her, or alternate versions of herself.Prior to these scenes, the woman who plays Billyâs wife tells a policeman that she had been hypnotised to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from Inland Empire. A parallel plotline involves Polish circus artists in the present day, as well as Polish prostitutes in ÅÃ³dÅº during the 1930s, who are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, \\"Who is she?\\" Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them and \\"say whether you've known me before.\\" In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver long monologues to an unidentified man touching upon her childhood sexual abuse, disastrous relationships, and retaliations. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization, and then is hired by a circus from Poland because he is said to be \\"good with animals.\\" There is much talk of the Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced sheâs being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver.Finally, Sue walks down Hollywood Boulevard, and is startled to see her doppelgÃ¤nger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to Pomona. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face until she finally dies, promising her \\"no more blue tomorrows.\\" Off-camera, Kingsley yells \\"Cut!\\" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.As the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only On High in Blue Tomorrowsâencompassing some of the subplots of the filmâbut events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked \\"Axxon N\\". Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be the Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki's own face, and then an even more distorted face bleeding from its mouth.Nikki flees into a nearby roomâRoom 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds the Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces a man and child.Nikki is then seen back home, smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them Laura Harring, Nastassja Kinski, and Ben Harper. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks around and says, \\"Sweet!\\" Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to Nina Simone's \\"Sinner Man\\" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat., Question: What is the name of Nikki's co-star?

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. After reading the above, is \\"The battle of Alcacer-Quiber\\" the correct answer to the question \\"The death of Sebastião and 18,000 followers was precipitated by what event?\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, \\"The Battle of Alcacer-Quiber\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"The death of Sebastião and 18,000 followers was precipitated by what event?\\" It is established in the text that Sebastião's reign ended calamitously at this battle, during which he and approximately 18,000 of his followers lost their lives. This implies that this battle was the event that precipitated their deaths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Catholic U. student recounts her struggles after reporting a sex assault Erin Cavalier downed a couple of glasses of wine and a­ few shots of tequila, grabbed a water bottle filled with vodka and Sprite, and headed out from her dormitory to celebrate the end of her first semester at the Catholic University of America. After polishing off the mixed drink, the 18-year-old from Northern California started drinking beer at a party. After midnight, in what she describes as a stupor, she asked if someone could help her walk to her room on the campus in Northeast Washington. A male student she considered an acquaintance volunteered. She says she blacked out. Back in her room, Cavalier recalled, she regained awareness. The man was on top of her, she said, raping her. Cavalier said she was too drunk to agree to sex. “I never consented,” she said. The man saw it differently, telling investigators that Cavalier was a willing participant in a sexual encounter after he walked her home and she signed him into her dorm. The man was never charged with a crime, and an initial D.C. police report said evidence indicated there was mutual consent. But that was not nearly the end of it. What happened that night in December 2012 set off a chain of events that a year and a half later pushed the Vatican’s university in America into a fierce national debate over how colleges respond to allegations of sexual assault. In growing numbers, students such as Cavalier are stepping forward to force public scrutiny of an issue that has quietly affected colleges for decades. Some campus sex-assault cases are clear-cut. But many emerge from murky circumstances involving alcohol, parties and young adults living away from home for the first time. Under federal law, sexual violence on campuses is not only a crime but also a form of illegal discrimination requiring speedy remedy. Students are increasingly demanding action from their schools, which in turn face heightened pressure from the government to investigate and resolve the allegations. Reports of forcible sex offenses on college campuses nationwide grew from about 2,600 in 2009 to more than 3,900 in 2012, according to federal data, up 50 percent. That doesn’t mean campuses became that much more dangerous in those years; experts say students who in previous generations probably would have remained silent about what they experienced are now coming forward. Colleges, too, have become more thorough in documenting the problem and teaching students that incapacitation, through alcohol or drugs, prevents effective consent. The trend is likely to accelerate. President Obama drew public attention to campus sex assaults this year through a White House task force. Lawmakers have invited survivors of sex assaults to Capitol Hill to advise them on legislation. But there are at least two sides to every allegation. Brett A. Sokolow, president of the National Center for Higher Education Risk Management, said he worries that many students accused of sexual misconduct are “getting much less of a fair shake than they used to.” Accused students often say they are the victims. Sokolow said some cases that in years past would have been considered “drunk sex” are now being examined for disciplinary violations. Colleges, he said, “have got to get this thing just right.” Cavalier, now 20 and a rising junior, said she wants Catholic to reform how it responds to reports of sexual assault. “As a survivor,” she said, “I know how horrible it can go.” The Washington Post generally does not identify those who report being victims of sexual assault. But Cavalier chose to go public with her story to illuminate a complaint she filed with the federal government alleging that Catholic University mishandled her case, violating a 1972 law called Title IX that bars gender discrimination. The complaint alleges that Cavalier was unfairly “forced to lobby, argue and fight for a grievance hearing,” an internal misconduct trial held behind closed doors. Catholic initially decided a hearing was unwarranted but reversed itself after several months of back and forth with Cavalier and her representatives. A university hearing board concluded in October that there was insufficient evidence to find that Cavalier’s alleged attacker had violated the student conduct code. “The university is confident that it acted appropriately in investigating and resolving the issue that gave rise to the student’s complaint,” Catholic spokesman Victor Nakas said. Catholic, with 6,700 students, was founded under a papal charter in 1887. It is one of about 60 institutions of higher education under federal investigation for their handling of reports of sexual violence. They range from Harvard Law School and Princeton University to the Butte-Glenn Community College District in California and the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine, according to federal officials, who disclosed a comprehensive catalogue of investigations for the first time on May 1. Four Virginia schools are under investigation: the University of Virginia, the College of William and Mary, James Madison University, and the University of Richmond. So is Frostburg State University in Western Maryland. Federal investigations begin after individuals file complaints or the Education Department initiates a compliance review. Federal officials said they have drawn no conclusions that any of the schools are violating the law. After Catholic was named on the federal list, Cavalier recounted what happened to her on Dec. 15, 2012, and the aftermath, in an interview with The Post at her attorney’s office in downtown Washington. She signed a statement that waived her federal privacy rights — giving the university permission to disclose information about her case — but Catholic officials declined to discuss any specifics, citing the federal investigation and the school’s “obligations to both of the students who are parties to the matter.” The student Cavalier says raped her could not be reached through telephone calls to his family residence, and he did not respond to a message via Facebook. The Post is not identifying him because he has not been charged with a crime, and because of the university hearing board’s conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to find violations of the student conduct code. The man’s father said there is much more to the case than Cavalier’s version. “There are lots of facts not being brought out,” he said, declining to comment further. The sixth of seven children in her family, Cavalier attended Catholic schools while growing up in the San Francisco Bay area. She said she came to Catholic University to play lacrosse and also was drawn to its location in the nation’s capital. She belongs to the College Republicans, is majoring in politics and wants to explore careers in counterterrorism. On the Friday night after her first set of final exams, Dec. 14, 2012, Cavalier was doing laundry in her dorm, preparing to fly home. At about 9 p.m., she bumped into a friend who invited her to a gathering at another dorm. She believes she started drinking at 10 p.m. and stopped at about 12:30 a.m. at a party with about a dozen other students. It was something all too common on college campuses: a binge. Cavalier described herself that night as “blackout drunk,” saying she “obviously had way too much to drink, and it was not a good idea on my end.” She said she was almost falling asleep on a couch when she realized she needed to leave. “I kind of announced I would like someone to walk me home,” she said. She said she recalls little else until she realized she was being attacked in her bed. After the man left, Cavalier went into a bathroom. A resident assistant found her there, crying. “She asked what happened,” Cavalier said. “I said I had been raped.” A blur of activity ensued: The RA called for help. Campus police responded. She went to Washington Hospital Center and saw a nurse specializing in sexual-assault examinations. An advocate from Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. arrived to help. Cavalier called her parents. D.C. police interviewed her, and she said she decided not to seek criminal charges. “They literally asked me upfront while I was highly intoxicated and absolutely traumatized in every way,” Cavalier said. “The idea of going through a legal process sounded horrible.” But Cavalier disputed a D.C. police report filed at 3:03 a.m. that described the incident, according to a preliminary statement, as consensual sex. “While I cannot tell you exactly what I said that night to the police or really any other person, the people that I spoke to that night that I trust, my parents, my friends . . . have all told me that I said I was raped,” Cavalier said. “No consent.” Lindsey Silverberg, the advocate who joined Cavalier at the hospital, confirmed that account. A toxicology report from the hospital showed that at 8:28 a.m., Cavalier’s blood alcohol level was 0.097, above the 0.08 legal threshold for drunk driving. Because blood alcohol level eventually diminishes after a person stops drinking, Cavalier’s attorneys believe hers was at or above 0.2 at the time of the incident, a high level of intoxication. That afternoon, Cavalier flew home to California. Two days later, a Catholic administrator sent her an e-mail. “I wanted to check in and see how you were doing,” Rachel Wainer, an assistant dean of students, wrote on Dec. 17, according to a copy of the e-mail Cavalier provided. “I understand that you may have questions or concerns, and I would be more than happy to connect with you.” Cavalier replied a few days later, suggesting times to talk by phone that week. But she said she didn’t hear back from Wainer or anyone else throughout the winter break. When she returned to Washington, Cavalier e-mailed Wainer, asking to meet. “Now that I am back on campus,” she wrote on Jan. 14, 2013, “I would like to get back to this.” “We can absolutely meet today,” Wainer replied within a few minutes. “I am sorry we were not able to touch base before the University closed for the Christmas holiday.” The e-mail appears to confirm a four-week gap in communication between Catholic and Cavalier. Wainer declined to discuss the case. Lawrence J. Morris, Catholic’s general counsel and a retired Army colonel, also declined to comment on Cavalier’s case. But Morris said the university strives to connect quickly with any student who reports a sex assault, even during vacations. “You do your best to get to the person as immediately as we can,” he said, “and we persist regardless of what the immediate circumstances will be.” When Cavalier met with Wainer, the assistant dean explained her options: pursue a criminal charge, file an internal misconduct complaint, do both or do neither. Cavalier chose to seek internal discipline. On Jan. 16, campus police interviewed her. On March 20, the dean of students, Jonathan C. Sawyer, told her there was not enough evidence to hold a hearing on her complaint. The university, he said, would issue an order for the two students to avoid contact with each other and take other steps, if necessary, to preserve distance between them. Cavalier said she was stunned. Until that point, she had considered Catholic a neutral arbiter. But the dismissal of her complaint left her in doubt. “They didn’t even allow me to have a chance to prove that I was raped,” she said. “That’s the part that made me feel very alone.” Cavalier then connected with Matt Ornstein, a lawyer with the victim recovery network. He helped her obtain the toxicology report from the hospital and attached it to an appeal, saying the university should look at whether Cavalier had been too drunk to have the capacity to consent. On April 10, campus police reinterviewed Cavalier. Ornstein, who was present, said one of the investigators told Cavalier some alcoholics are able to consent to sex even though they are drunk. “I was upset when they explained that,” he said. “You know, Erin’s not . . . a 50-year-old career alcoholic who’s been dealing with these things her whole life and has developed some incredible tolerance or has some sort of natural immunity to alcohol.” Ornstein said the investigators were skeptical of Cavalier’s incapacitation claim because of what they viewed as a lack of corroboration from witnesses. The lawyer asked to see a report on what witnesses said. Investigators said they would forward his request. The case then stagnated. Cavalier continued her studies and did her best to avoid the other student on campus. In California, her parents were dismayed. The spring semester of 2013 was slipping away, and the issues seemed unresolved. “It was a long, frustrating period of time,” said her father, Mark Cavalier, a financial adviser. He flew to Washington in May and hired lawyer Kobie Flowers to explore legal options. On July 8, Ornstein obtained the internal report from campus police that he had requested in April. Cavalier and her attorneys said they were struck by statements from witnesses at the party that seemed to support her claim of drunken incapacitation, such as “she was staggering,” and she “was very drunk and falling asleep.” They scheduled a meeting with Sawyer and Morris on Aug. 21 to demand a hearing, with Cavalier’s father present. Almost immediately, Sawyer told them the university would grant their request. The approach of the Oct. 3 hearing underscored questions about how a university inquiry differs from a court of law: Who could attend? Who could ask questions? What were the rules of evidence? Who would judge? Catholic’s system, according to Morris, provides for a hearing board of four administrators or faculty members. The accuser and accused are given equal access to witness statements and other documents. During the closed and confidential proceedings, students must speak for themselves but are allowed to have a lawyer with them as an adviser. Only the board is allowed to question witnesses, but the accuser and the accused may suggest questions through notecards. The board decides cases on a standard of “preponderance of the evidence” — that is, whether it is more likely than not that a student broke the university’s rules. The standard — lower than the “beyond reasonable doubt” burden of proof for a criminal conviction — follows federal guidance issued in 2011. Critics say the preponderance standard is unfair to the accused. Morris said the goal of the process is to “remove or diminish any obstacles” to delivery of the best possible educational experience. “Remember, it is unrealistic for a university investigative and adjudicative process to bring perfect justice in these cases,” he said. Public courts of law, he said, are better equipped for that task. Cavalier said Catholic failed to make clear with enough advance notice that her parents were entitled to attend the hearing in the university’s Pryzbyla student center. They couldn’t make it; Flowers and Ornstein accompanied her. The hearing lasted about six hours, Cavalier said. She sat across the room from the accused student. The board issued a verdict six days later, finding that “no force was involved,” that Cavalier was “not incapable of giving consent,” and that the male student “would not reasonably have thought” that Cavalier was incapacitated or unable to give consent. The man was cleared. On Dec. 20, Cavalier filed an eight-page Title IX complaint with the Office for Civil Rights of the Education Department. The federal investigation began on Jan. 8. A key question is whether Catholic’s response to the sexual-assault report was prompt and equitable. Federal guidelines say colleges typically take 60 days to investigate cases, but that is not a requirement. Before all this happened, Cavalier said, she knew of Title IX only as a law that prohibited gender bias in college sports. Now, like a growing number of students, she has learned of its relevance to sexual violence. Cavalier wants to help spread the word, saying she is “totally up for being an activist.” She recently helped organize a Take Back the Night event on campus to promote prevention of sexual violence. She also is resolved to stay at Catholic and finish her degree. “I’m not going to allow something he did — and something that the administration maybe didn’t take care of correctly — I’m not going to let that take away from my college experience,” she said. “Because that’s not fair.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Erin Cavalier, a student at the Catholic University of America, recounts her struggles after reporting a sexual assault on campus in 2012, leading to a federal investigation into the university's handling of her case as part of the growing national debate on how colleges respond to allegations of sexual assault."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Summarize this article: New ways in which Facebook might have played a role in 2016 election meddling continue to emerge. Yesterday (March 16), the company announced the suspension of data analytics company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) and its prominent parent political firm Cambridge Analytica—three years after it illegally used the data of up to 50 million users. According to a note shared by the company, in 2015 Facebook found out that, despite telling its users otherwise, Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan passed user data collected through personality testing app “thisisyourdigitallife” (which touted itself as a personality test used by psychologists) to the political firm Cambridge Analytica—a company owned by Robert Mercer and led by Steve Bannon at the time—and to Christopher Wylie, from a digital service company called Eunoia Technologies. The 270,000 people who downloaded the app allowed it access not only to their data, but some of their friends’—depending on their settings. However, they did not authorize that their data be shared with other companies, a behavior that is in violation of Facebook platform policies. The revelation comes from reporting by The Observer. According to Wylie, a whistleblower who detailed the illegal data use, saying the information was used in 2014 to profile individual US voters who were then served Donald Trump ads during the election. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,” Wylie told The Observer, “That was the basis that the entire company was built on.” After finding out that the breach had happened, Facebook deleted the app, then requested a certification from all involved that the obtained data had been destroyed—but Facebook never followed up on it. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back,” Wylie said. Only last month, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO and Facebook both told the British parliament the political firm did not harvest any of the social media user data to target election ads during Brexit. The firm continues to deny the allegations: Facebook has repeatedly denied that data breaches as the one detailed occurred—and even after finding out, years after the fact, that it had, the company defends its best practices. ”We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook states in the same note that admits their “vigorous enforcement” consisted in taking the word of someone who had already broken their regulation to ensure said information was protected. Further, the note tries to put the responsibility of controlling such information on the user, but highlighting a the “ways we give people the tools to control their experience.” ||||| Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. “This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said. Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.” In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. ||||| The algorithm used in the Facebook data breach trawled though personal data for information on sexual orientation, race, gender – and even intelligence and childhood trauma The algorithm at the heart of the Facebook data breach sounds almost too dystopian to be real. It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma. A few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds. Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window. Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach Read more But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments. When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality. These were just some of the unexpected but consistent correlations noted in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal in 2013. “Few users were associated with ‘likes’ explicitly revealing their attributes. For example, less than 5% of users labelled as gay were connected with explicitly gay groups, such as No H8 Campaign,” the peer-reviewed research found. The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default. “The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said. “Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.” To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work. Quick guide How the story unfolded Show Hide In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well. The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable. Aleksandr Kogan To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters. It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use. And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred. It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another. The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.” The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed. Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”. Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties. |||||","completion":"Facebook is facing allegations that it was involved in the illegal harvesting of data from around 50 million users by data analytics firm Strategic Communication Laboratories and its parent political firm, Cambridge Analytica. The claim comes from whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Researcher Aleksandr Kogan created an app that subsequently passed user data to Cambridge Analytica, a company that was then led by Trump ally Steve Bannon. The data was reportedly used to profile individuals for targeted ads during the 2016 election. Facebook learned about the breach in 2015, but has been accused of failing to check that the data had been destroyed. The company denies it committed a data breach and has suspended both firms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success.

Question: Whose body do Oskar's fellow students find during an ice skating field trip at the lake? Movie title: Let the Right One In Movie plot: Twelve year old Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) is so wimpy that he's constantly picked on by the other boys at his school, especially Conny (Patrik Rydmark) and his two friends, Martin (Mikael Erhardsson) and Andreas (Johan Sömnes). Out of fear, Oskar never fights back. In the evenings, however, he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors. One evening, Oskar notices a new girl about his age and her father moving into into #15, the apartment next door to his. Oddly, the first thing they do is to cover the windows with cardboard. What Oskar doesn't know is that Håkan(Per Ragnar) is not Eli (Lina Leandersson)'s father... he is her renfield... and Eli is a vampire. It is Håkan's job to bring Eli fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he anesthetizes them with halothane, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their necks, and catches the blood in a jug, leaving the bodies to be discovered the next day. Unfortunately for Eli, Håkan is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he either lost or forgot the jug filled with blood. Consequently, Eli is beginning to get hungry.One evening, as Oskar is in the courtyard stabbing a tree in lieu of his tormentors, he notices Eli watching him. She's not very friendly, as she tells him right off that she can't be friends with him. The next evening, they run into each other again in the courtyard. Oskar notices that Eli is not wearing a coat even though it's the dead of winter in Stockholm. What's more, she's not even cold. And she smells bad. Still, Oskar shares with her his Rubik's cube and shows her how to work it. After Oskar has gone inside, Eli goes hunting. She waits in the shadows under a bridge. When two neighborhood friends, Jocke (Mikael Rahm) and Lacke (Peter Carlberg), part company, and Jocko walks under the bridge, Eli calls out, \\"Help me!\\" Thinking that the little girl has fallen, Jocko picks her up. Suddenly, Eli latches onto him and bites his neck. Gösta (Karl-Robert... A:","completion":"During an ice-skating field trip at the lake, Oskar's fellow students find the body of Jocke (Mikael Rahm). Jocke is one of the neighborhood friends who falls victim to Eli the vampire. Eli attacks Jocke while he is walking under a bridge after leaving his friend Lacke (Peter Carlberg). Eli pretends to need help to lure Jocke into picking her up, and then she latches onto him and bites his neck. Gösta (Karl-Robert Lindgren), another local, witnesses the attack but doesn't intervene, as he is too afraid. The discovery of Jocke's body serves as a significant and tense plot point in the movie \\"Let the Right One In,\\" as it provides a visual representation of the danger and horror surrounding Eli's true nature as a vampire. This event further highlights the internal and moral struggle that Oskar faces as he grows closer to Eli and begins to understand her true identity. Despite being a vampire, Eli comes across as a compelling character, creating a sense of ambiguity around whether investing in her companionship is a wise decision for Oskar. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, you should consider the movie's unique approach to the vampire genre, focusing on character development and the emotional journey of a young, bullied boy finding solace and strength through his growing friendship with a supernatural being. Additionally, it's essential to evaluate the appeal of the plot, the depth of characters, and the overall market interest in both the vampire genre and coming-of-age stories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brush Valley Township was formed from Brush Creek in 1835 , and named for the valley of Wheatfield Township .","completion":"No, the two sentences do not mean the same thing. Here's why: 1. Sentence analysis: a. The first sentence tells that Brush Valley Township was formed in 1835 from Wheatfield Township and was named after the valley of Brush Creek. This implies that Wheatfield Township was the original larger entity from which Brush Valley Township was carved out, and the name 'Brush Valley Township' was inspired by the geographical feature, the valley of Brush Creek. b. The second sentence states that Brush Valley Township was formed from Brush Creek in 1835, and named for the valley of Wheatfield Township. This implies that Brush Creek was the original entity from where Brush Valley Township was created. The name 'Brush Valley Township' in this case is stated to be named after the valley within Wheatfield Township, which does not intuitively make sense. 2. Logic: a. Historically townships are politically designated areas usually formed from larger administrative territories like counties or larger townships, not geographical features like rivers or creeks. Therefore, the formation of a township from a creek as mentioned in the second sentence is confusing and does not follow normal administrative practices. b. Naming a new township after a valley from the original larger township would be more probable, as suggested in the first sentence, rather than naming it after a valley in another, possibly unrelated, township, as suggested in the second sentence.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Jodi Picoult rules the literary roost She takes none of it for granted. Not the sales figures, the fame, the fortune, the fact that her name pops up on bestseller lists with the frequency of freakishly popular scribes such as Stephen King and Mary Higgins Clark. If you're inclined to trust what Jodi Picoult says -- and if you're not, then you're the kind of cynic who probably isn't interested in her or her books, anyway -- she is still, after 17 novels and 18 years on the job, just as humble, wide-eyed and hardworking as she was at the beginning of her career. \\"I can't believe anyone buys my books,\\" Picoult says from her home near Hanover, N.H. \\"I would've been happy just being published and having my mother buy a copy. I've been very fortunate. \\"It's still a little bit of a miracle.\\" Even miracles, though, need some muscle behind them. For Picoult, 43, the push comes from a rigorous writing schedule -- she's up at 5 each morning and, after a three-mile walk with a longtime pal, settles down in her home office to write until 3:30 p.m., when her three children barge in from school -- and an amazing ability to put her finger on hot-button social issues that her novels explore with honesty, authenticity and emotional power. Her trademark is the domestic drama, the story that puts ordinary people in the midst of contemporary crises: teen suicide, bullying, childhood sexual abuse, school violence. But in novels such as \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" (2004), a story about parents who conceive a child so that an older child, ill with leukemia, will have a match for blood marrow donation, and which was made into a 2009 movie starring Cameron Diaz, Picoult doesn't use the family-in-peril motif as a cheap gimmick. Her books are written with naturalness and flair. She knows how to tell a story, and how to fill it with intriguing, believable characters. Her latest novel, \\"House Rules,\\" published last week, is a whodunit with a twist. The young man accused of murder, Jacob Hunt, has Asperger's syndrome. It falls to his plucky mom, Emma; his brooding brother, Theo; and a bumbling young attorney named Oliver to go to bat for Jacob. Like many of Picoult's works, \\"House Rules\\" is told from multiple points of view and includes a great deal of information about its theme -- Asperger's -- but the facts are added gently, artfully, so that it never feels like a term paper. To research \\"House Rules,\\" she met with seven young people with Asperger's and corresponded with many more. \\"It was like cracking open their minds. This was an important part of making Jacob real.\\" Picoult, a native of Long Island, N.Y., is a graduate of Princeton University. That's where she met her husband, Tim van Leer. She began writing seriously in college and never stopped. \\"For me, books start with the voices of my characters,\\" she says. \\"I can hear them all so clearly.\\" And those topical themes? \\"I worry about these things myself. The things I write about are the things that keep me up at night. \\"You don't do this to be famous or to have money. If you're going to write, you do it for you. It's a compulsion. When I don't write, I get itchy. The stories are like something under my skin.\\" Keller is cultural critic at the Chicago Tribune. Summary:","completion":"Best-selling author Jodi Picoult maintains a humble and hardworking attitude towards her success, adhering to a strict writing schedule. Her novels explore hot-button social issues, with her latest, \\"House Rules,\\" focusing on a murder suspect with Asperger's syndrome.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two farmers tried different methods of growing their crops. Nate used pesticides, while his buddy Don used bacterium that produces a toxin instead. Don was happy with the results. But I can use this background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying. What is an answer for this question: Which farmer didn't use a an insecticidal spray that is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active? Answer:","completion":"The farmer who did not use an insecticidal spray that is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active is Nate. Justifying my answer, from the given situation, it was stated that Nate used pesticides. It was not specified that Nate used an inactive, digestible form of pest control like the Bt toxin. Also, considering the background information provided, the Bt toxin needs to be ingested by pests to be activated. Don used this bacterium for pest control and experienced satisfactory results. Therefore, Nate is the one who didn't use the insecticidal spray that needs digestion by an insect to become active in this situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Illinois police departments from Naperville to Peoria are offering their lobbies as \\"safe havens\\" for completing online transactions, joining a national trend. Naperville police Cmdr. Ken Parcel said Monday that the department plans to announce that the lobby of its station can be used by buyers and sellers who connect through Craigslist and other online markets. Most Internet-related crime in the western suburb involves impersonal scams, not in-person transactions, Parcel said, who described the lobby policy as \\"a preventative measure to ensure there's a safe place to allow (buyers and sellers) to conduct their normal lives and business.\\" The department's staff won't be involved in the transactions or oversee them, Parcel said. Late last month, the Peoria Police Department announced that residents could use a department parking lot and the lobby of its station for online transactions, \\"in an effort to deter Craigslist robberies.\\" The Chicago Police Department said in a statement Monday that there are no dedicated \\"safe zones\\" for Craigslist buyers and sellers in the city, but it echoed Naperville's desire to keep transactions safe. \\"If you plan on buying or selling items via Craigslist or any other online site, the Chicago Police Department suggests that you conduct your transaction at the closest police station to protect both the buyer and seller,\\" the statement said. The statement did not specify which areas in or around Chicago police stations would be open for online buyers and sellers to complete their deals. The department recommended that such transactions take place in well-lit, public places and, if possible, that those involved \\"bring another person with you.\\" Reports of violent crime and theft stemming from Craigslist transactions occasionally appear on police blotters in the city and suburbs. In one instance, a dispute over a Craigslist transaction for an online gaming system in 2013 led to the shooting death of a 24-year-old Tinley Park man. But such crimes are rare, according to the Chicago Police Department. Police in Illinois said crime didn't drive the forming of safe havens, though one Indiana official said it was the impetus. Dax Norton, town manager in Whitestown, said a number of violent crimes linked to Craigslist transactions in Indiana were the \\"straw that broke the camel's back.\\" He said the town recently decided to offer its municipal complex. Residents can even request a police officer to look over the transaction, Norton said. \\"My wife uses Craigslist a lot,\\" Norton said. \\"I think it's a great idea.\\" Since Whitestown announced the service last month, police have overseen various transactions, including one involving a puppy otherwise destined for a local animal shelter, Norton said. Not all police departments are jumping on board to oversee Craigslist transactions. Edgar Gregory, deputy chief of the Joliet Police Department, said there are other locations available for safe transactions. He suggested residents use public lots, even the police station's, but said the department doesn't oversee sales transactions. No one from Craigslist could be reached for comment. But Craigslist features a personal safety page suggesting users meet in a public place, tell a family member where they are going and take a cellphone. The page notes that the \\"overwhelming majority of Craigslist users are trustworthy and well-intentioned,\\" and that violent crime is low. Even so, the movement to make such transactions safer is gathering steam nationwide. In Hartford, Conn., there's \\"Operation Safe Lot,\\" in which online deals can be completed in a police parking lot. In Virginia Beach, Va., a program called \\"Find a Safe Place\\" allows such transactions in police station lobbies. Lombard resident Kay Pauli said he always meets his Craigslist buyers in a public place, like a mall or a gas station. Right now, Pauli is focused on selling a Budweiser neon sign. Pauli, who said he likes the idea of meeting at a police department or public building, said he's heard stories of Craigslist crimes but hasn't had any problems with safety in the years he's sold items through the site. \\"We usually meet at a public place,\\" he said. \\"It's an easy way for people to find me, too. Like a JCPenney or something.\\" cgross@tribpub.com Twitter @lexygross ||||| A Montgomery County community is setting up one of the nation's first Craigslist Transaction Safe Zones. Conshohocken Police want to make sure people doing business on the popular website do it safely. FOX 29's Dave Schratwieser shows us how it works. The Conshohocken Police Station Parking Lot on Fayette Street couldn't be any safer. There are police cars, surveillance cameras, good lighting even an emergency phone to contact police. So now the chief has designated the parking lot and the lobby at police headquarters as an online safe transaction zone. He says if you're conducting a one on one transaction where money is changing hands. This is the safest place to do it. The new safe transaction zone comes as rip offs are increasing. Two weeks ago 34-year old Dion Jordan met a guy who wanted to purchase a dodge charger like this at a local Wawa. During a second pre-arranged meeting at an airport hotel, they went for a test drive. That's when police say Jordan and an accomplice kidnapped the buyer and robbed him of 2,000 at gunpoint. Jordan has now been charged in the car deal gone bad and the murder of 49 year old Dallas Long two days earlier. He faces charges in several bank robberies where he wore this expensive Hollywood style disguise. Investigators are now trying to link him to five other murders. The chief says never go to a transaction alone and always use cash or a bank check. Do the transaction during daytime hours when financial institutions are open in case a problem develops with the deal. He believes other towns will follow suit with safety zones of their own. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Police departments in Illinois are offering their stations as safe places for people to meet and finish the deals they made on websites like Craigslist.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Have the seller name the first price. Mention you looked at a reputable pricing guide. Negotiate until you reach the right deal. Close the sale.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of Negotiation: A Comprehensive Guide to Closing Deals Successfully Introduction Negotiations are an essential part of our daily lives, especially in the realm of commerce. Whether you are a buyer or a seller, it is crucial to be aware of the strategies and tactics necessary to close a successful deal. This article explores a simple, yet effective approach to achieving this goal: allowing the seller to name the first price, referring to a reputable pricing guide, engaging in the negotiation process until a suitable deal is reached, and ultimately, closing the sale. Each of these steps will be examined in detail to provide a reliable framework for any negotiation scenario. Step 1: Have the Seller Name the First Price The opening offer is a critical aspect of any negotiation, as it sets the tone and provides a reference point for the rest of the discussion. It is generally advantageous to have the seller present the first price, as it allows the buyer to assess the seller's position and price expectation. This initial offer can also serve as an anchor that guides the rest of the negotiation, and it is important to bear in mind that the seller may intentionally make a high opening offer with the expectation that the final price will likely be negotiated downwards. Step 2: Mention You Looked at a Reputable Pricing Guide Once the seller has named the first price, it is essential for the buyer to demonstrate knowledge of the product or service's current market value. Referring to a reputable pricing guide or online platform where prices are regularly updated can provide valuable data to support the buyer's negotiation strategy. For example, resources like Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds can offer insights into the fair market value of a used car, while websites like Zillow and Redfin can help assess the true value of a property. Mentioning the use of a pricing guide can also foster trust and credibility in the negotiation process. It signals to the seller that the buyer is informed and has invested time in researching prior to the negotiation. As a result, the seller is more likely to take the buyer's counteroffers seriously, leading to a more productive and amicable negotiation process. Step 3: Negotiate Until You Reach the Right Deal The core of any negotiation lies in the exchange of proposals and counteroffers. To reach a satisfactory agreement, both parties must be willing to compromise and find common ground. It is crucial for the buyer to remain firm but flexible in their demands, focusing on their ultimate goal and staying open to alternative options. When negotiating, buyers should consider the following tactics: 1. Highlight the benefits of the offer for the seller: Emphasizing how the deal can benefit the seller in terms of quick payment, lower transaction costs, or fewer risks can increase the appeal of the buyer's proposal. 2. Utilize silence as a tool: By pausing after the seller's counteroffer, the buyer can create an ambiance of contemplation and tactfully prompt the seller to ponder over the proposal, possibly resulting in an improved offer. 3. Be willing to walk away: Demonstrating that the buyer is ready to walk away from a deal that does not fit their expectations can exert pressure on the seller to be more flexible and amenable during the negotiation process. Step 4: Close the Sale Once an agreement has been reached, it is essential to formally close the sale. Both parties should review and confirm the deal's details, including the agreed-upon price, payment terms, and any additional agreements. The buyer and seller may sign a contract or purchase agreement to seal the deal and protect their respective interests. Finally, arrangements for payment, delivery, or transfer of ownership should be made to ensure a smooth and hassle-free transaction. Conclusion In conclusion, mastering the art of negotiation involves being well-prepared, informed, and patient. By following the steps outlined in this article—having the seller name the first price, mentioning a reputable pricing guide, negotiating effectively, and closing the sale—a buyer can greatly increase the likelihood of securing a successful deal. Moreover, adopting these strategies in the negotiation process can lead to stronger relationships, mutual understanding, and lasting satisfaction for both parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Mark Prigg The man behind Apple's maps software has been sacked in a major restructuring of the computer giant's executives after he refused to apologise for its Maps software. Scott Forstall, a long-time lieutenant of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, was asked to leave following years of friction with other top executives and his recent refusal to take responsibility for the mishandling of the Apple's much-criticized mapping software, people familiar with the situation said. Sources said Forstall refused to sign a public apology after Apple's mapping product, which displaced the popular Google Maps on the iPhone and the iPad in September, contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce criticism.

The decision to let go of Forstall, an influential figure in the world of Apple, came after years of friction within the company's upper echelon and his unwillingness to publicly apologize for the shortcomings of their Maps software. Apple's Maps app was meant to rival Google Maps, which had dominated the map application space for years. However, upon its release in September, Apple Maps quickly became the subject of ridicule and frustration, as it contained numerous errors and failed to meet user expectations. In an attempt to address the widespread dissatisfaction, Apple sought to issue an apology to all users affected by the flawed product. However, when asked to sign the apology letter, Forstall refused, which ultimately led to his termination. Apple's decision to part ways with Forstall was a demonstration of their commitment to rectifying mistakes and upholding their reputation as a reliable and user-centric brand. Forstall's departure also led to a significant restructuring within the company, with various responsibilities being redistributed amongst other executives. This restructuring aimed to foster a more collaborative environment and discourage the internal conflicts that had arisen during Forstall's tenure. Ultimately, Apple hoped to promote a stronger sense of unity, cohesion, and direction moving forward, while reassuring users that they were taking the necessary steps to ensure the quality and reliability of future products and services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses.

Sentence 1: \\"okay i'm a meat and potato man yeah\\" This sentence suggests that the speaker is affirming their preference for meat and potatoes. The casual tone and informal language imply a strong affinity for this type of food. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that the speaker \\"prefers\\" meat and potatoes, as it mainly portrays their identity as a \\"meat and potato man.\\" Sentence 2: \\"I prefer meat and potatoes.\\" In this sentence, the speaker clearly states their preference for meat and potatoes. This declaration is more explicit, as the term \\"prefer\\" implies a conscious choice or a deliberate ranking of options in favor of meat and potatoes. Considering the information in both sentences, it can be determined whether or not the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. (A) Yes - The second sentence can be seen as being entailed by the first, in the sense that both sentences convey the idea that the speaker has a strong affinity for meat and potatoes. While the first sentence is less explicit, the informal tone and the use of \\"meat and potato man\\" indicate that the speaker indeed has a preference for meat and potatoes. Therefore, the sentiments expressed in both sentences are consistent. (B) It is not possible to tell - This option can be discarded because it is clear from both sentences that the speaker expresses a liking for meat and potatoes. (C) No - This option can be rejected as well, since the first sentence implies a preference without explicitly stating it, and the second sentence confirms this preference directly. In conclusion, given the context and the sentiments expressed in both sentences, the correct answer is (A) Yes.

Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon.

Although not considered a good movie by traditional standards, it delivers big laughs and has an undeniable wit and charm that many find enjoyable. With a bigger budget than previous Smith productions, the movie offers some remarkable elements for fans. However, it is also criticized for its excessive use of product placement, dragging and uneven pacing, and overall untapped potential. Despite its flaws, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is viewed as a cult classic with something to both tickle and offend everyone, making it an entertaining experience for those familiar with the characters and the director's style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: John had been on a business trip for three weeks. It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. \\"How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?\\" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . \\"No, I have to have roses,\\" he said, \\"My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite.\\" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, \\"Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars.\\" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . The light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, \\"Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please. Tell my mommy I love her.\\" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car. He drove quickly to the flower shop and told the florist he would take the flowers personally.

Here is an article: (Bloomberg) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he will go “everywhere I’m invited” to warn against a nuclear deal with Iran, as criticism mounted over his planned speech on the negotiations to the U.S. Congress. “As prime minister of Israel, I am obligated to make every effort to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons that would be aimed at Israel,” Netanyahu said at the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem today. “This effort is worldwide and I will go anywhere I am invited in order to enunciate the State of Israel’s position and in order to defend its future and its existence,” he said according to an e-mailed statement from his office. Netanyahu accepted House Speaker John Boehner’s invitation to address a joint session of Congress on March 3, in a move that wasn’t coordinated with President Barack Obama’s administration. Critics say the measure is meant to undercut Obama’s efforts to negotiate a deal with the Iranians and will hurt Israel by damaging ties with the White House. They also say the speech will give the prime minister an unfair boost before Israel’s March 17 elections. “This is a poke in the eye” of the Obama administration, “and ultimately a blow to Israel,” said lawmaker Shelly Yachimovich of the opposition Labor party. “In exchange for giving a campaign speech, Netanyahu is prepared to hurt our relationship with the U.S.,” Yachimovich said today on Israel Radio. Republicans and some Democrats in Congress seek new economic and diplomatic sanctions on the government in Tehran, a move that could kill any nuclear deal. Obama said in his State of the Union address that he would veto any proposed legislation that increases sanctions. Netanyahu backs tougher penalties. Sanctions were imposed to deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons technology. Iran says its nuclear program is designed only for energy and medical uses, and other Middle Eastern nations say Israel harbors the region’s only atomic arsenal. Israel neither confirms nor denies possessing atomic weapons. Netanyahu’s former ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, called on him to cancel his Congressional address. “His behavior over the last few days created the impression that this is a cynical political move, and it could hurt our attempts to act against Iran,” said Oren, now campaigning for parliament on the list of the newly formed Kulanu party, in an interview Saturday on Channel 2 television. Ties between Netanyahu and Obama have historically been strained over issues including peacemaking with the Palestinians and how to contain Iran’s nuclear program. Obama won’t meet Netanyahu when he comes to Washington to deliver his speech because it’s too close to the Israeli elections, the White House said.

Write an article based on this summary: – Interest in the JonBenet Ramsey case was resurrected with the 20th anniversary of the 6-year-old's December 1996 death, and now Netflix is joining the revival. Per Variety, the company has acquired the rights to Casting JonBenet, a documentary by Kitty Green set to debut at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah later this month. After its premiere in Park City, the film—which Netflix says will be its first nonfiction flick to make a Sundance showing—will air on Netflix and in some theaters nationwide in the spring. The filmmakers plumbed the community of Boulder, Colo., where the Ramsey family lived when JonBenet was killed, documenting locals looking back on the unsolved crime and analyzing its effect on families there. \\"Netflix is the ideal home for showcasing Kitty’s sharply rendered vision of a mythic American tragedy to a global audience,\\" a Netflix programming exec says. Rolling Stone and the Hollywood Reporter note the film joins a glut of recent JonBenet coverage, including Lifetime's Who Killed JonBenet?, A&E's The Killing of JonBenet: The Truth Uncovered, and CBS' The Case of: JonBenet Ramsey, which spurred a lawsuit from JonBenet's brother, Burke (the special theorized Burke may have accidentally killed her). Wondering if Netflix's cinematic coup is an attempt to cash in on the obsession with true-crime hits like the Serial podcast and Netflix's own Making a Murderer? Megan Reynolds doesn't think so. \\"The Ramsey case has consumed the national imagination for the twenty years it's gone unsolved,\\" she writes for Jezebel. \\"It feels crass to say that a new take on the case is refreshing, but examining the impact of the case through this lens is a perspective that we have yet to see.\\" (New DNA tests are in the works in JonBenet's case.)","completion":"Hey there!

They wanted to see how the mystery changed the families who lived there. An important person from Netflix said that this movie is the perfect way to tell people around the world about this sad and mysterious story. Some people might think that Netflix just wants to make money with this movie, like they did with other movies about true stories. But a writer named Megan Reynolds thinks differently.

Jafar identifies a street urchin named Aladdin as worthy. Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu cross paths with Princess Jasmine, who has run away from the palace, unwilling to be married off to another snobbish suitor. Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and fall in love, but Jafar has Aladdin apprehended, tricking Jasmine into thinking that he was decapitated.

Agatha Answer:","completion":"Title: Dreams of Deception Step 1: Introduce the characters and setting Our story is set in a small, quiet town, where Walter, a middle-aged high school teacher, leads a seemingly ordinary life. Agatha is a charming and enigmatic new neighbor who moves in next door. Step 2: Establish the main conflict Walter begins to have increasingly disturbing, vivid dreams of murdering Agatha. Initially, he dismisses these dreams as mere nightmares, but as they become more frequent and intense, he starts to question his own sanity and motives. Step 3: Deepen the character relationships As Walter battles the darkness within himself, he can't help but be drawn to Agatha. He befriends her in hopes of finding an explanation for his murderous dreams. As they grow closer, a connection forms between them. Agatha has her own secrets she conceals from the world, which creates an air of intrigue around her. Step 4: Introduce a plot twist Walter attends a town event where he stumbles upon an old newspaper article about Agatha's father, a former prominent townsman, who also suffered from an eerily similar sequence of dreams before he mysteriously disappeared. Step 5: The dreams intensify Haunted by the realization that Agatha's father went mad and vanished under similar circumstances, Walter's dreams become even more violent and frequent. His psyche begins to crumble, and he fears he may follow the same fate. Step 6: Walter seeks help Desperate, Walter begins seeking professional help. He visits a therapist, Dr. Hanson, who helps him explore the root cause of these dreams. They discover repressed memories and hidden desires tied to a past trauma, which may be the key to unraveling the source of his visions. Step 7: The discovery As Walter unravels the truth, he learns that Agatha's father was a part of a secret cult believed to hold the power to control dreams. He and Agatha stumble upon the cult's hidden lair where they discover the truth: the dreams are a result of dark magic orchestrated by the mysterious cult leader, who now targets Agatha.

Walter is forced to confront both his inner demons and the looming threat of the cult that seeks to control Agatha's destiny.

The premise showcases Griffith Park as an ideal location for nature enthusiasts and individuals looking for recreational opportunities. The park's extensive trail system allows visitors to engage in numerous outdoor activities, providing them with a closer spot to immerse themselves in nature. Exploring the trails enables park-goers to get some exercise while taking in the beautiful surroundings and panoramic views the park has to offer.

The date set for the executions of the three Quaker evangelists , Mary Dyer , Marmaduke Stephenson and William Robinson , was 27 October 1659 .","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences essentially convey the same information but in a slightly different way. Paraphrasing involves rephrasing a sentence without changing its meaning, oftentimes altering sentence structure, word order, or using synonyms for some words. Here's a detailed breakdown of the two sentences to better illustrate the paraphrasing: 1. Original sentence: \\"The date for the executions of the three Quakers - Evangelists , Mary Dyer , Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson - was set on 27 October 1659.\\" 2. Paraphrased sentence: \\"The date set for the executions of the three Quaker evangelists, Mary Dyer, Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson, was 27 October 1659.\\" While the overall meaning of the sentences is the same, let's analyze the paraphrased elements in the second sentence: - The phrase \\"The date for the executions\\" is changed to \\"The date set for the executions\\" – a slight variation in the structure while preserving the meaning. - The order of the words \\"three Quakers - Evangelists\\" is altered to \\"three Quaker evangelists\\" – making it more concise and easier to understand. - The position of \\"Mary Dyer, Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson\\" remains the same in both sentences. - The phrase \\"was set on 27 October 1659\\" has been altered to \\"was 27 October 1659,\\" which simplifies the sentence by removing the preposition \\"on.\\" In conclusion, the paraphrased sentence effectively communicates the same message as the original sentence, with minor adjustments made to the structure and phrasing.

The movie explores political upheaval, journalistic ethics, and the complexities of human relationships in the midst of chaos. The film features a talented ensemble cast, with Mel Gibson playing the role of Guy Hamilton, an Australian journalist who arrives in Indonesia to cover the political unrest. Sigourney Weaver stars as Jill Bryant, a British embassy officer who becomes romantically involved with Guy, further complicating his professional and personal endeavours.

Additionally, the offense was without Jay Cutler after his injury sustained in week two, meaning Brian Hoyer started against Dallas, though Alshon Jeffery, who was battling knee injuries during the week, made his return for week three. The defense, also depleted by injuries with players like Danny Trevathan and Eddie Goldman ruled out for the game, had to be able to successfully tackle Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant and tight end Jason Witten while also applying pressure on rookie quarterback Dak Prescott. Joniak also wrote the Bears needed to excel on both sides in the red zone; against the Eagles, the Bears defense had a 50 percent touchdown efficiency in the red zone, made some big plays in the red zone in the loss to the Eagles, with a 50 percent touchdown efficiency rating on six attempts. Meanwhile, against the Washington Redskins, the Cowboys restricted them to just two field goals in the red zone, including a late interception by Barry Church. The Bears fell behind early when Prescott scored on a quarterback sneak during the opening drive. The Bears' next two drives ended with punts, while the Cowboys' resulting drives concluded with scores: Dan Bailey kicked a 49-yard field goal and Lance Dunbar scored on a one-yard run. Down 17-0, Chicago would score their first points of the game via Connor Barth's 34-yard field goal in the second quarter. On the following kickoff, Barth attempted an onside kick that Sherrick McManis successfully recovered, but Jonathan Anderson was ruled offsides, nullifying the play. Instead of retrying the onside, Barth simply kicked off. Dallas scored on the next drive with Alfred Morris' three-yard touchdown run. After the Bears punted to start the second half, they regained possession when Terrance Williams was stripped by Jacoby Glenn and Adrian Amos recovered the ball. The takeaway resulted in the first touchdown of the game for the Bears when Hoyer threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller. Though the Cowboys punted on their next drive, Cameron Meredith was stripped by J. J. Wilcox and Tyrone Crawford recovered the fumble. However, they were unable to score when Bailey missed a 47-yard field goal wide left. In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys extended the lead when Bryant scored on a 17-yard touchdown catch. Hoyer responded when he threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Miller to make the score 31-14, but he lost a fumble when he was strip-sacked by Benson Mayowa on the Bears' next series, while the offense was unable to score on their final possession. Who missed a field goal in the third quarter?","completion":"Dan Bailey missed a field goal in the third quarter."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

Sentence 1: To date, six of the seven local offices have given the plan a preliminary thumbs-up. Sentence 2: The six preliminary approvals from local offices are enough to enact the plan. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we need to analyze both sentences and understand their relationship. Sentence 1: \\"To date, six of the seven local offices have given the plan a preliminary thumbs-up.\\" This sentence provides us with the information that there are seven local offices, and six of them have already provided preliminary approval or support for the plan being discussed. It indicates that things are looking favorable for the plan but doesn't explicitly mention if this approval is sufficient for the plan to be enacted. Sentence 2: \\"The six preliminary approvals from local offices are enough to enact the plan.\\" This sentence claims that the six approvals obtained from the local offices are sufficient for the plan to proceed. It assumes that there is no need for all seven offices to approve the plan in order for it to be enacted. Now, let's examine whether Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. Entailment, in this context, means that if the facts in Sentence 1 are true, then Sentence 2 must also be true. In other words, if six out of seven local offices have provided preliminary approval, is it necessarily true that this is adequate for enacting the plan? It is not possible to infer from Sentence 1 alone that the approval from six local offices is enough to enact the plan. There is no explicit information given about the required number of approvals or the process to enact the plan. It could be the case that only a simple majority is needed, or perhaps unanimous approval from all seven offices is required, but this information is not provided in Sentence 1. Therefore, Sentence 2 is not entailed by Sentence 1. Although they are related in context and share information about the approvals from local offices, Sentence 1 doesn't provide enough information to conclude that the six obtained approvals are sufficient for plan enactment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Hans Holbein the Younger (German: Hans Holbein der Jungere) (c. 1497 - between 7 October and 29 November 1543) was a German artist and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style. He is best known as one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire and Reformation propaganda, and made a significant contribution to the history of book design. Context: Throughout his life, Holbein designed for both large-scale decorative works such as murals and smaller objects, including plate and jewellery. In many cases, his designs, or copies of them, are the sole evidence for such works. For example, his murals for the Hertenstein House in Lucerne and for the House of the Dance in Basel are known only through his designs. As his career progressed, he added Italian Renaissance motifs to his Gothic vocabulary. Many of the intricate designs etched into suits of Greenwich armour, including King Henry's own personal tournament harnesses, were based on designs by Holbein. His style continued to influence the unique form of English armour for nearly half a century after his death. Holbein's cartoon for part of the dynastic Tudor wall painting at Whitehall reveals how he prepared for a large mural. It was made of 25 pieces of paper, each figure cut out and pasted onto the background. Many of Holbein's designs for glass painting, metalwork, jewellery, and weapons also survive. All demonstrate the precision and fluidity of his draughtsmanship. In the view of art historian Susan Foister, \\"These qualities so animate his decorative designs, whether individual motifs, such as his favoured serpentine mermen and women, or the larger shapes of cups, frames, and fountains, that they scintillate on paper even before their transformation into precious metal and stone\\". Holbein's way of designing objects was to sketch preliminary ideas and then draw successive versions with increasing precision. His final draft was a presentation version. He often used traditional patterns for ornamental details such as foliage and branches. When designing precious objects, Holbein worked closely with craftsmen such as goldsmiths. His design work, suggests art historian John North, \\"gave him an unparalleled feel for the textures of materials of all kinds, and it also gave him the habit of relating physical accessories to face and personality in his portraiture\\". Although little is known of Holbein's workshop, scholars assume that his drawings were partly intended as sources for his assistants. Question: How did he continue to influence armour? Answer:","completion":"Hans Holbein the Younger continued to influence armour by incorporating his unique and intricate designs into suits of Greenwich armour, including King Henry's personal tournament harnesses. By merging Italian Renaissance motifs with his Gothic vocabulary, Holbein created a distinct style that had a lasting impact on English armour for nearly half a century after his death. His detailed design work, closely collaborating with craftsmen like goldsmiths in creating precious objects, gave him a deep understanding of materials and textures, which he applied in crafting armour designs as well. Additionally, Holbein's draughtsmanship skills and his method of designing objects in a progressively precise manner contributed to shaping the aesthetic and craftsmanship of armour during his time and even after his passing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, John Locke, the Glorious Revolution, the English Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement. Later, the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In North America, Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers.

Information: - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - No Policy is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band State of Alert, the first band to be fronted by Henry Rollins. It was released on 7-inch vinyl in March 1981 through Dischord Records (No. 2). Since Dischord was tied up in releasing Minor Threat's debut EP, the production of \\"No Policy\\" was funded entirely by Rollins. - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. - Straight edge (sometimes abbreviated sXe or signified XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in reaction to the excesses of punk subculture. For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and/or not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term \\"straight edge\\" was adopted from the 1981 song \\"Straight Edge\\" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C. in September 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, the Idles' recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 \\"Minor Disturbance\\" EP before they broke up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing the Teen Idles 7\\" record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk outfit Minor Threat. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - State of Alert (often abbreviated to S.O.A.) was an American hardcore punk group formed in Washington, D.C. in October 1980, and disbanded in July 1981. The group was formed after the members' of previous group, The Extorts, lost its vocalist Lyle Preslar and hired Henry Rollins, then known by his birth name Henry Garfield. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - Henry Rollins (born Henry Lawrence Garfield; February 13, 1961) is an American musician, actor, writer, television and radio host, and comedian. He hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW, and is a regular columnist for \\"LA Weekly\\" and \\"Rolling Stone Australia\\". - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner. - Minor Disturbance is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band The Teen Idles. It was released in December 1980 through Dischord Records (No. 1). Comprising eight songs, \\"Minor Disturbance\\" referenced a number of issues pertinent to the band, from being turned away at local concerts due to their age (\\"Too Young to Rock\\") to what they felt was the increasing complacency of many first wave punk bands (\\"Fleeting Fury\\"). Upon its release, \\"Minor Disturbance\\", Dischord Records' first release, received positive reviews from local fanzines and gained airplay on local radio stations. - SST Records is an American independent record label formed in 1978 in Long Beach, California by musician Greg Ginn. The company was initially formed in 1966 by Ginn at age 12, as Solid State Tuners, a small business through which he sold electronics equipment. Ginn repurposed the company as a record label to release material by his band Black Flag. - Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties. The region is traditionally described as eight counties, based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, which includes Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions. Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States. - Lyle Preslar is an American musician best known for being the guitar player and songwriter for the hardcore punk band Minor Threat . Before that , he was the vocalist for The Extorts , whom later became State of Alert after he quit .

He rose rapidly and was a senior staff officer at the headquarters of V Corps from 1902 to 1904. Next he joined the Great General Staff in Berlin, which was commanded by Alfred von Schlieffen, Ludendorff directed the Second or Mobilization Section from 1904-13. Soon he was joined by Max Bauer, a brilliant artillery officer, who became a close friend. By 1911, Ludendorff was a full colonel. His section was responsible for writing the mass of detailed orders needed to bring the mobilized troops into position to implement the Schlieffen Plan. For this they covertly surveyed frontier fortifications in Russia, France and Belgium. For instance, in 1911 Ludendorff visited the key Belgian fortress city of Liege. Deputies of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which became the largest party in the Reichstag after the German federal elections of 1912, seldom gave priority to army expenditures, whether to build up its reserves or to fund advanced weaponry such as Krupp's siege cannons. Instead, they preferred to concentrate military spending on the Imperial German Navy. Ludendorff's calculations showed that to properly implement the Schlieffen Plan the Army lacked six corps. Members of the General Staff were instructed to keep out of politics and the public eye, but Ludendorff shrugged off such restrictions. With a retired general, August Keim, and the head of the Pan-German League, Heinrich Class, he vigorously lobbied the Reichstag for the additional men. In 1913 funding was approved for four additional corps but Ludendorff was transferred to regimental duties as commander of the 39th (Lower Rhine) Fusiliers, stationed at Dusseldorf. \\"I attributed the change partly for my having pressed for those three additional army corps.\\" Barbara Tuchman characterizes Ludendorff in her book The Guns of August as Schlieffen's devoted disciple who was a glutton for work and a man of granite character but who was deliberately friendless and forbidding and therefore remained little known or liked. It is true that as his wife testified, \\"Anyone who knows Ludendorff knows that he has not a spark of humor...\\". He was voluble nonetheless, although he shunned small talk. John Lee, states that while Ludendorff was with his Fusiliers, \\"he became the perfect regimental commander ... the younger officers came to adore him.\\" His adjutant, Wilhelm Breucker, became a devoted lifelong friend.

In a bold statement against the illegal ivory trade, more than a ton of confiscated ivory from various sources was crushed into pieces, sending a clear message that the United States and the international community will no longer tolerate this illicit business. The Times Square ivory crush, as it came to be known, was an unprecedented event, capturing the attention of the world. It wasn't a mere demonstration; it was an essential step towards raising awareness on the critical issue of wildlife trafficking and the terrible impact it has on elephant populations in Asia and Africa. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, the government agency responsible for managing and protecting wildlife resources, organized this public display to stress the urgency of the situation and spread the message that ordinary people can make a difference. Ivory trading has plagued the planet for centuries. Thousands of elephants have been killed by poachers for their tusks, which are then sold in black markets across the globe, particularly in East Asia. Despite international efforts to curb the illegal trade, including the 1989 international ban on ivory sales by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the black market for ivory continues to thrive, driving elephant populations towards extinction. In recent years, governments and organizations around the world have joined forces in a renewed effort to combat the destructive trade. The US government, for instance, has implemented stricter regulations and penalties for those involved in the illegal ivory trade, such as the implementation of the African Elephant Conservation Act in 2014. At the same time, celebrities and public figures have utilized their influence to draw attention to the topic, engaging their audience in the fight against wildlife trafficking. In the United States, several states have enacted laws banning the sale of ivory, while California, being the third-largest market for illegal ivory worldwide, passed one of the most stringent bans on the sale and purchase of both new and antique ivory products in 2015. The joint efforts of federal, state authorities, and non-governmental organizations have led to a drastic decrease in imports and exports of ivory into and outside the United States. However, more needs to be done to ensure a lasting impact and to save the remaining elephant populations, such as addressing the demand for ivory products in countries where they are still legal or widely appreciated. Countries in Asia, particularly China and Vietnam, are the leading consumers of ivory products, leading to the establishment of heavy regulations on the trade and public destruction of confiscated ivory in these nations as well. The Times Square ivory crush, a powerful and symbolic event, has put the illegal trade of ivory under the global spotlight. It is a visual testament to the critical situation facing not just elephants, but the entire ecosystem. A world without these majestic creatures, who are essential to the balance of their habitats, is unimaginable. For this reason, governments, organizations, and citizens must continue to work together to combat illegal ivory trade, raising awareness, countering demand, and advocating for stricter international regulations. Efforts to expose and dismantle black market enterprises and remove the financial incentives that drive poachers must be redoubled. The future of elephants, as well as countless other species threatened by human greed, depends on this collaborative effort. The Times Square ivory crush is not just a call to action; it is a stark reminder that unless humanity unites in the battle against wildlife trafficking, we will lose these irreplaceable beings and the invaluable role they play in our world."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

Problem:Article: The ancient whistled language of the small island of La Gomera, off the coast of Africa, is about to disappear because of new technology and globalization. Now, a web company has taken on the task of saving the language by marrying history with technology. Silbo Gomero, a language used only on La Gomera Island, sounds to the untrained ear like few other known languages. The sounds that make up this language are made by whistling, rather than by speaking. The language was brought to the island by African setters many centuries ago. To communicate among the _ populated inland hills and valleys, shepherds had to use the whistled language, which could be heard and understood over distances of up to eight kilometers, compared to about 200 meters for a spoken word. With the development of new technologies like the cellphone, the number of Silbo Gomero whistlers has declined to around 1,000. Many of the older generation of islanders fear the language, which they consider to be a cultural symbol, may become extinct. To save Silbo Gomero, Busuu.com, a website based in Madrid, has launched a movement to teach Internet users worldwide to communicate using the language's unique whistles. \\"We really like the whole story of Silbo Gomero because it is really a fun language, \\" said Bernard Niesner, the company's co-founder.

By Mark Duell PUBLISHED: 07:54 EST, 4 September 2013 | UPDATED: 09:42 EST, 4 September 2013 A record-breaking autogyro pilot famous for his work in a James Bond film has died at the age of 97. Retired Wing Commander Ken Wallis was best known for his action sequence flying in the Little Nellie aircraft as actor Sean Connery’s stunt double in the 1967 film You Only Live Twice. Mr Wallis, who was honoured with an MBE in 1996, piloted 24 wartime missions over Europe in Wellington bombers, before spending 20 years in weapons research for the Royal Air Force. Mr Wallis kept a fleet of 20 autogyros, including a replica of","completion":"the Little Nellie, at his private airstrip and workshop in Norfolk, England, where he continued to fly and maintain the unique aircraft well into his nineties. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks over the years, including a near-fatal crash in 1970, he remained passionate about his work and dedicated to advancing the capabilities of autogyros. An avid inventor and engineer, Mr Wallis was instrumental in refining and improving the design of autogyros, contributing countless innovations to the field. His efforts ultimately led to the development of more efficient, stable, and versatile autogyros that could be used for a variety of purposes, from recreation and sport to search and rescue operations. In addition to his work on autogyros, Mr Wallis also had a rich and varied career, both in and out of the military. After serving as a pilot during World War II, he went on to become an instructor at the Central Flying School, where he trained fellow pilots to fly new and advanced aircraft. This eventually evolved into a role in weapons research for the Royal Air Force, where he was heavily involved in the development of guided missiles and other cutting-edge technologies of the time. Throughout his life, Mr Wallis was a prominent figure in the aviation community and a well-respected advocate for autogyros. To recognize his many accomplishments, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1996. This prestigious award, granted by the Queen, honors those who have provided exceptional service to the United Kingdom and its Commonwealth. Mr Wallis's death left a significant void in the world of aviation, particularly in the realm of autogyros. However, his incredible contributions to the field, encompassing his work as a pilot, inventor, and advocate, live on through the countless lives he touched and the advances in technology that he was instrumental in creating. In conclusion, the sentence ends with a tribute to Ken Wallis's remarkable life and his enduring legacy in the world of aviation. His passion for autogyros and unwavering dedication to their development have forever shaped the course of aviation history, leaving an indelible mark on the industry that will continue to inspire and impact future generations of pilots and engineers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hey now, yours truly, TheatreX, found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a \\"cult hit\\" so of course it came home with me. What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway, this is one strange pair, Big Edie and Little Edie...Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings, and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother, age 79) apparently likes to run around naked, and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, except to them. They live in absolute filth, cats doing their business wherever (\\"Look, that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait!\\"), and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt, who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested.

A handful of Bronze Age relics has fostered an assumption that prehistoric settlers inhabited Ibiza thousands of years ago. Greater evidence of such a people is found on Mallorca and Menorca than on Ibiza, but one of the Balearics' most important sites is actually on the island of Formentera, where the megalithic monument/tomb of Ca Na Costa has been dated to 2000 b.c. Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums. The Romans never really infiltrated Ibiza, and even after the defeat of Hannibal in 202 b.c. during the Second Punic War their influence was restrained. Only with the fall of Carthage in 146 b.c. did they manage to make inroads, but, as local historians stress, Ibiza was neither conquered nor annexed by Rome, but confederated, retaining remarkable autonomy. For centuries to come the old Carthaginian traditions were allowed to continue on Ibiza alongside the new Roman way of life.

Summarize this article: One woman's story of finding love after discovering she had a brain tumour ï¿½I knew halfway through my third date with Andy that I was going to break his heart. Not because I was going to cheat on him or dump him, but because I knew I was going to die. ï¿½Iï¿½d been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour a month earlier, in January 2015, after suffering a huge seizure in my bathroom. I was rushed to hospital, and they found a rare, inoperable tumour. Sitting in the consultantï¿½s office the following week, my parents wept as I was given three years to live, but I just felt stunned. I was only in my twenties, yet I was already a manager at a designer outlet and I was incredibly ambitious. Plus, while Iï¿½d had a four-year relationship in the past, we werenï¿½t right for each other. It might sound silly, but when I was told I was dying, I was panicking about never getting the chance to meet ï¿½the oneï¿½. ï¿½Back at home, I felt frightened and depressed. My sister was on Tinder and after a fortnight she suggested I set up an account as a distraction. Reluctantly trawling through matches, I swiped right on Andyï¿½s face. When he messaged me just minutes later, I felt a flush of excitement, then remembered it couldnï¿½t go anywhere. Dying people didnï¿½t date, so part of me did feel guilty as I replied, but just being ï¿½normalï¿½ again was so lovely that I couldnï¿½t help myself. ï¿½Soon we were talking constantly, but when he texted to suggest meeting up, I felt scared. ï¿½Iï¿½m terminally ill and Iï¿½ll probably be dead in three years,ï¿½ I typed. ï¿½Iï¿½ll understand if you want to leave things here.ï¿½ I figured this was it, heï¿½d delete my number and go find a healthy girl. He replied a minute later, saying he still wanted to meet me. Follow Annaï¿½s blog at ï¿½Heading to meet him at a pub, I was still sceptical. I brought up my illness, in case he felt uncomfortable. However, I soon realised that, in the nicest possible way, Andy wasnï¿½t interested in my condition, he just wanted to get to know me. After our third date, on Valentineï¿½s Day, we admitted we were falling for each other. In December, ten months after weï¿½d met, he proposed. As he got down on one knee, I cried and asked if he was sure ï¿½ if we went ahead, heï¿½d be a widower before he was 30. I could die following a seizure, or he might have to take care of me until the bitter end. My personality could even change. But he said that heï¿½d rather be married to me for a few years than not at all.Follow Annaï¿½s blog at Annaswabey.wordpress.com ï¿½When we got together, I worried about what our families would think. My parents were concerned in case Andy didnï¿½t fully understand how sick I was, and I was nervous about meeting his mum and dad ï¿½ whoï¿½d want their son to fall in love with someone who was dying? But they said theyï¿½d never seen Andy so happy, and that was good enough for them. ï¿½I know Iï¿½m lucky. Anyone who thinks Iï¿½ve ï¿½settledï¿½ just to get married before I die is crazy. Why would I waste precious time pretending to be in love? We both know things have moved quickly, and it is pretty intense, but we still bicker over whose turn it is to wash the dishes. We just make up quickly; thereï¿½s no time to dwell on the little things. ï¿½Iï¿½ve come to terms with my death now, yet I struggle when I think about how itï¿½s going to affect Andy. I worry about how heï¿½ll cope when I start slipping away. I hate the idea of him becoming my carer, and it terrifies me that I might not be ï¿½myselfï¿½ at the end. Thatï¿½s why weï¿½re getting married in September. Itï¿½s not about a dress or a big party, itï¿½s about making memories for Andy and making a commitment to each other. Terminal illness has taught me to seize opportunities, so I have to trust him when he says he wants to be with me forever. Even if we donï¿½t know how long that is.

The 25-year-old from Leicester, England, passed away on Friday, September 16, just one day before she was due to wed Bell in front of 160 love ones. “Amongst our sadness, we are so proud of her courage, her spirit and the determination she showed throughout her illness,” Swabey’s heartbroken family wrote on Facebook. The University of Portsmouth graduate was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor in January 2015, one month before meeting Bell on the dating app Tinder. “I knew halfway through my third date with Andy that I was going to break his heart. Not because I was going to cheat on him or dump him, but because I knew I was going to die,” Swabey revealed in an essay for Marie Claire. Courtesy Anna Swabey/Facebook In the piece, the cancer-stricken Swabey admitted she was anxious about how her passing would affect her fiancé. “I worry about how he’ll cope when I start slipping away. I hate the idea of him becoming my carer, and it terrifies me that I might not be ‘myself’ at the end,” she wrote. \\"That’s why we’re getting married in September.

I wanted to write this on Anna’s behalf because, as a family, we all know how important her blog is to her. Most of you will already know that Anna’s condition deteriorated suddenly on Sunday but I know she would want to share her story with you in a bit more detail than just a few Facebook posts from her far less eloquent sister. So apologies in advance for the ramblings you’re about to read! I’ll go back to 27th July when Anna had her last scan. This was 6 weeks after finishing 14 months of chemotherapy. With her wedding to Andy coming up we were all hoping for another ‘stable’ scan result to mirror the one we received in January, however this was not to be. Anna’s results showed a new growth away from her original tumour site. Not long after her scan Anna started showing signs of struggle, suffering from nausea, vomiting and severe tiredness, which led her surgical consultant at Charing Cross to suggest another surgery; at the very least to perform a biopsy so that we knew what we were dealing with. This surgery took place on 9th August, and her incredible surgeons removed a plum to small apple-sized mass, which we hoped would relieve a bit of pressure and hopefully give her some more time. Anna appeared to recover well from the surgery, though not as quickly as her first operation, and was making steady progress at home. When Anna’s biopsy results came back on 15th August, I remember the phone call vividly. It was the night before my partner and I were due to go down to London for a few days sightseeing with our boys. Anna’s call was matter of fact and to the point. Her biopsy results showed that the tumour had now progressed to a Grade 4. In all honesty, and in typical Anna style, she was more bothered about how we all felt than what it meant for her. After receiving the news, life continued relatively normally for us all; wedding plans were still underway, and even though we knew that the new grading of Anna’s tumour meant that it was even more aggressive, we still all thought that she would be well enough to go ahead with her big day. This was not to be however, and 2 weeks ago we saw a huge change in Anna. She was very tired, much slower in her movements and lacked her usual gusto (though she was still able to put all of us in our places if she felt we were fussing her too much!).. We visited our family in Stoke for our cousin’s wedding reception, and we are so grateful that she was able to do that. Our family loves a good get together and this was the last social outing she had, which meant such a lot to all of us. Since then Anna’s condition has deteriorated dramatically and last Sunday, shortly before she was due to come over for Sunday dinner with the family (she’s a sucker for Yorkshire puddings and Lee, my partner, is a pro at making them!) she took ill. We had the most horrendous couple of days last Sunday and Monday, as Anna’s deterioration was so sudden, she was sleeping constantly and we truly thought that we wouldn’t get her back from that. However, we have been privileged to have spent the past few days being able to chat with her briefly, in between her naps, thanks to the amazing care she has received from her district nurse, Heather, and the Marie Curie team, who have given her a concoction of drugs to keep her peaceful and comfortable, yet relatively alert when she has managed any time awake. Christine, the lovely Macmillan nurse that came to visit us yesterday, described medicine as a bit of an art and she wasn’t wrong! Anna’s team of nurses have given us time that we didn’t think we would have after her decline last Sunday, and we will be forever grateful for that. During the past 18 months, we have chatted with Anna on many occasions about what kind of care she would like to receive, and where she wanted to be during her final weeks, and she was always adamant that she wanted to be at home. So last Sunday when she became very sick we were faced with the difficult decision of whether to let her go to hospital for further scans, tests etc., or to allow her to stay at home where she wanted to be. As a family, we all felt that staying at home was the right choice to make, assuming that between us we would be responsible for the bulk of her care which, needless to say, we were all more than prepared to do. We couldn’t have been more mistaken however, and the incredible home care she has received, from district nurses, Marie Curie and Dale Care, has allowed us to spend precious time with Anna, without having to worry about her personal care or medical needs. I cannot believe how calm and peaceful the past week has been and what an incredible group of people we have been lucky enough to have been in the hands of; starting with Terry, the paramedic who initially came out to us last Sunday, along with Richard and Lynn from Marie Curie, and Dr Dharani, the urgent care GP, whose reassuring presence was such a comfort on a truly distressing day. Not only have all Anna’s nurses and carers been amazing with her, but they have really taken the time with our family to ensure that we are all looking after ourselves and each other during this most heart-breaking time. So that’s really all I can update you with for now. Anna is peaceful in her bed, mostly sleeping. We have a few lucid moments with her every now and then, and we are so thankful that she is comfortable and relatively pain-free. We can all take comfort in the fact that Anna is exactly where she wants to be, surrounded by her close family and friends. I wanted to say, on behalf of Anna’s family, that we are so grateful for the unending support and encouragement you have all shown to Anna (and us!) since her initial diagnosis. She has faced her illness with positivity, dignity and absolute defiance, and we couldn’t be more proud of our beautiful girl and the way she has touched so many people with her amazing attitude to life, love and the whole heap of crap she has had to contend with since the arrival of Trev!! We have all taken our cue from Anna throughout her illness and we will continue to do so through the most heart-breaking and difficult time of our lives. Thank you to you all for reaffirming to us what we already know, that our amazing Anna is one of life’s truly inspiring and incredible human beings. From a very proud and humbled sister, Victoria xx NB Anna’s goal was to reach £100k in her fundraising efforts for Brain Tumour Research Campaign. Though her own Justgiving page shows a total of around £53k, her combined total with friends, family and army of supporters is closer to £80k, and we are so proud of her, and her fundraisers for raising such an incredible amount. You can donate to Anna’s Justgiving page here.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. I'm not very fond of them myself, but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of British horror cinema. The House That Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus, featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a Scotland Yard officer by an estate agent. This film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, whom horror fans will recognise as one of Lee's co-stars in the greatest British horror film of all time; The Wicker Man. The first segment of the film, titled \\"Method For Murder\\" tells the story of a horror storywriter, whose creation; a strangler named \\"Dominic\\" is brought to life by his own imagination. This story builds suspense very well; through his girlfriend, he, and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination. This story certainly isn't very original, but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist; which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise. The second story, titled \\"Waxworks\\", stars Peter Cushing and is my least favourite of the four. This tale follows the story of Phillip Grayson (Cushing), a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in. Inside, he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess. Quite what the woman's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details. Cushing is later joined by his friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Ackland) and that's when the tale really starts to pick up. The setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isn't a new idea; the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent 1966 horror film, \\"Chamber of Horrors\\". Although the one here isn't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film, the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect, much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia, brought about by the limited area of the museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch, and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan. Despite being my least favourite, this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down. The film continues with \\"Sweets for the Sweet\\", which is without doubt the best of the omnibus. This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out. It leaves the audience guessing; we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter, but we don't know who, or what, it is. Christopher Lee, as usual, portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness; the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll, and the fact that she isn't allowed to go to school or have any toys. The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end, epitomised by the truly chilling line in which Lee tells his babysitter that he is, in fact, afraid of his daughter. The ending to this section is superbly played out, in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told, and will stay with you long after the end credits roll. The omnibus finishes with \\"The Cloak\\", which is definitely the most comedic of the four. This tale is about a hammy horror film star that, unimpressed by his latest film's technical side, goes out and buys himself a cloak. Naturally, this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak. Unlike the other three tales, this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs. That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. The ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film, which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film. Also, look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula. A nice touch, I think. Overall, if you want a horror omnibus, you really cant go wrong with The House that Dripped Blood. The third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive, with the reviewer praising the film's suspense, atmosphere, settings, and acting performances, particularly from horror icons Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and Ingrid Pitt. The reviewer highlights the third story \\"Sweets for the Sweet\\" as the best of the omnibus and praises its chilling ending. Despite expressing a less favorable opinion about the second story \\"Waxworks,\\" the reviewer still finds it entertaining and engaging, thus not letting the anthology down. The humorous and contrasting tone of the final story is also appreciated. Overall, the reviewer enthusiastically recommends \\"The House That Dripped Blood\\" as a solid horror film and a worthwhile choice for a horror omnibus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where do Larry and Richard find Bernie's body? Movie plot title: Weekend at Bernie's Movie plot: Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are two low-level financial employees at an insurance corporation in New York City. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the Labor Day weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partner Vito (Louis Giambalvo), Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed. However, after Bernie leaves, Vito decides Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his greed and his relationship with Vito's girlfriend, Tina (Catherine Parks), and orders that he be killed instead. Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and plans the murders with Paulie (Don Calfa), the hitman, on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, killing Bernie with a drug overdose. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they find Bernie's body. Before they can call the police, guests arrive for a party that Bernie used to host every weekend.

Does \\"Genuine Old Persian is best attested in one of the three languages of the Behistun inscription, composed circa 520 BC, and which is the last inscription (and only inscription of significant length) in which Old Persian is still grammatically correct.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"When was the Behistun inscription written?\\"","completion":"Yes, the given statement provides the correct answer to \\"When was the Behistun inscription written?\\". The Behistun inscription was written circa 520 BC, as mentioned in the statement. However, for a more comprehensive understanding of the Behistun inscription and its historical context, let's delve deeper into the topic. The Behistun inscription is an ancient multilingual inscription carved on the side of the Mount Behistun in present-day Iran. It is among the most significant and famous inscriptions from the ancient world, and it was commissioned by Darius the Great, the third king of the Achaemenid Empire. The inscribed text narrates the achievements and victories of Darius and served as a display of his power and legitimacy as the emperor. The inscription itself is composed of three languages: Old Persian, Elamite, and Akkadian, which were the primary languages spoken in the Achaemenid Empire. It covers an area of about 49 x 82 feet (15 x 25 meters) and is located approximately 328 feet (100 meters) above the ground. The trilingual nature of the inscription enabled scholars to decode the ancient cuneiform script, and it played a vital role in understanding the languages and history of the Achaemenid Empire. Old Persian is an ancient Iranian language used mainly by the Achaemenid dynasty. Although the Old Persian language is found in numerous inscriptions and texts from the Achaemenid period, the language used in the Behistun inscription is considered \\"Genuine Old Persian\\" primarily because it remains grammatically correct in this specific inscription. It is also one of the longest and most complete samples of the Old Persian language. This makes the Behistun inscription an important source for understanding the Old Persian language, the achievements of Darius the Great, and the history of the Achaemenid Empire. So, the correct answer to \\"When was the Behistun inscription written?\\" is circa 520 BC, as stated in the original quote."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. - Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province. - An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since \\"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\\", the term \\"official language\\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government. - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - La Sarre is a town in northwestern Quebec, Canada, and is the most populous town and seat of the Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality. It is located at the intersection of Routes 111 and 393, on the La Sarre River, a tributary of Lake Abitibi. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario.

It became part of the province in 1898. It has a land area of 57,674.26 km (22,268.16 sq mi). The region is divided into five regional county municipalities (\\"French\\": municipalité régionale de comté, or MRC) and 79 municipalities. Its economy continues to be dominated by resource extraction industries. These include logging, mining all along the rich geologic Cadillac Fault between Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda, as well as agriculture. - Villa rustica (countryside villa) was the term used by the ancient Romans to denote a villa set in the open countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate (\\"latifundium\\"). The adjective \\"rusticum\\" was used to distinguish it from an urban or resort villa. The \\"villa rustica\\" would thus serve both as a residence of the landowner and his family (and retainers) and also as a farm management centre. It would often comprise separate buildings to accommodate farm labourers and sheds and barns for animals and crops. In modern British archaeology, a \\"villa rustica\\" is commonly (and misleadingly) referred to simply as a \\"Roman villa\\". - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - The Canada 2011 Census is a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population on May 10, 2011. Statistics Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, conducts a nationwide census every five years. In 2011, it consisted of a mandatory short form census questionnaire and an inaugural National Household Survey (NHS), a voluntary survey which replaced the mandatory long form census questionnaire; this substitution was the focus of much controversy. Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to jail time. - Statistics Canada, which was formed in 1971, is the Government of Canada government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. Its headquarters is in Ottawa. - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. - Ville is the modern French word of Latin origin now meaning \\"city\\" or \\"town\\", but the first meaning in the Middle Ages was \\"farm\\" (from Gallo-Romance < Latin \\"villa rustica\\") and then \\"village\\". The derivative suffix \\"-ville\\" is commonly used in English in names of cities, towns and villages. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality (Abitibi West) is a regional county municipality located in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec.

Review: Let me make one thing clear.for the most part, the mentality of those who run the show in Hollywood frankly p*sses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved, iconic characters from the pages of comic books. Why? Well let's take a typical Hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall we.. Executive no.1 'Hey there's lots of dollars to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days.' Executive no.2 'Good point, let's make one with haste then!  We'll do a lucky dip in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon!' (The dip takes place and a famous superheroes name is pulled out) Executive no.1 'Great! Now who can we get to play the part?' Executive no.2 'Who's a big box office star at the moment?' Executive no.1 '*name of big actor* is the in thing this week.' Executive no.2 'But does he really suit the role? I mean he doesn't resemble the character whatsoever.' Executive no.1 'Who cares?! He's a big name; We'll make the film with him in it anyway.' Executive no.2 'You're quite right! And besides we'll fill the entire film so chock full of glitzy special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anyway!' The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons I generally loath most modern superhero movies. All style, no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads. Of course to be equitable, there are exceptions to the above rule; when Hollywood does get it right  take the casting of the original (and still easily the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men films. But back to the general negative traits displayed by Hollywood today..wouldn't it be wonderful if our studio executives were to ALWAYS choose actors who actually suited the roles? Well in this less than ideal world, one filmmaker does just this believe it or not, by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts. His name is Sandy Collora. Sadly (but typically) Hollywood has not as of yet allowed Collora to direct a full length film but luckily for us, he has given us tantalizing glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two (as of yet) famous super hero short features. One is the superb Batman:Dead End and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely fictitious film called Worlds Finest. Well, let's not mince our words here  this is absolutely awesome stuff! The casting of Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn, (who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster Barbarian) makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel. In fact, in terms of physical resemblance, there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic character. Added to this Clark Bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the Dark Knight in Batman:Dead End; Again, yet another hugely judicious piece of casting! What can I say?  If only this was indeed a real, full length film! Hollywood studio executives  take note! THIS is how it should be done! As a final note, I am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans. Tellingly, the most acerbic and vehemently adverse reactions against it clearly come once more (as similarly with Batman: Dead End) from a younger, less cinematically experienced audience; a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal usage of base diction. Such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in Hollywood, will no doubt derive great satisfaction from. After all, these very same misguided individuals are in all probability the exact same sort of CGI addicted, popcorn stuffing imbeciles that revel in the majority of crap that Hollywood churns out by the deluge these days. Now, what is this review like? Select from: I. negative. II. positive.","completion":"This review is predominantly II. positive. The reviewer passionately expresses their dissatisfaction with the general state of Hollywood's treatment of iconic comic book characters and its typical casting choices. However, they praise Sandy Collora's work on both Batman: Dead End and Worlds Finest as examples of how casting should be done, staying true to the source material and selecting actors based on their resemblance to the characters. The reviewer shows a clear admiration and enthusiasm for Collora's mock trailer for Worlds Finest, highlighting the excellent casting choices of Michael O'Hearn and Clark Bartram as the iconic superhero characters. They express a strong desire to see a full-length film created with this level of care and attention to detail. The review also mentions the negative reactions from a younger, less experienced audience, which the reviewer laments as closed-mindedness. In sum, while the review contains criticism of Hollywood's general approach to superhero films, it is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic about Sandy Collora's work and vision for comic book adaptations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - The prince-electors (or simply electors) of the Holy Roman Empire ((), pl. \\"Kurfürsten\\", ) were the members of the electoral college of the Holy Roman Empire. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection). Absolute monarchy (such as Saudi Arabia) and dictatorship (such as North Korea) are the main historical forms of autocracy. In very early times, the term \\"autocrat\\" was coined as a favorable feature of the ruler, having some connection to the concept of \\"lack of conflicts of interests\\". - This is a list of those who were granted the rank of Feldmarschall by the Holy Roman Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , 1618 -- 1806 .

And I was wondering What will Aubrey want to do next? OPT: + test the students. + stop everyone from talking. + loved. Answer:","completion":"Aubrey, having successfully involved every student in the interactive activity to teach social skills, would probably want to continue building on that momentum and further enhance the learning experience for the students. Keeping the primary objective in mind, which is the development of social skills, Aubrey could consider the following steps: 1. Assess the outcomes: Before proceeding further, Aubrey might want to assess the impact of the interactive activity on the students. This could involve observing the students and asking for their feedback, which would help identify the strengths and weaknesses of the activity and the extent to which the intended learning outcomes were achieved. 2. Plan follow-up activities: Based on the outcomes of the initial activity, Aubrey might want to design follow-up exercises to reinforce the learned social skills and address any areas that need improvement. These activities can be adjusted according to the students' needs and can take several forms, such as role-playing, group discussions, or even storytelling sessions. 3. Monitor progress: It is crucial for Aubrey to keep track of the students' progress in developing social skills. This can be done through regular observation and evaluation, and by maintaining open communication with the students. Monitoring progress will not only help Aubrey determine the effectiveness of the activities but also allow for timely adjustments and support where needed. 4. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: As students become more comfortable with the social skills they've learned, Aubrey might want to create opportunities for them to teach and help each other. This can further strengthen their understanding of these skills and foster a collaborative, supportive learning environment. 5. Integrate social skills development into other aspects of learning: Instead of treating social skills as a separate topic, Aubrey could integrate it into other subjects or projects. For instance, incorporating elements of teamwork, communication, or empathy into group assignments in different subjects can help students realize the importance and relevance of social skills in various contexts. 6. Bridge the learning to real-life situations: Aubrey might want to help students apply their newfound social skills outside the classroom. This could involve arranging visits to elderly care homes, encouraging volunteer work, or connecting with other schools for joint social projects. Such experiences would provide students with practical opportunities to practice and refine their social skills in real-life situations. 7. Maintain a positive and safe learning environment: Lastly, Aubrey must ensure that the classroom remains a space where students feel comfortable to express themselves, learn from their mistakes, and receive constructive feedback. A nurturing, non-judgmental environment will support the students' growth and foster a positive attitude towards the development of social skills. In summary, following the success of the interactive activity, Aubrey might want to assess its outcomes, plan follow-up activities, monitor progress, encourage peer-to-peer learning, integrate social skills development into other aspects of learning, and create opportunities for applying skills in real-life situations. By doing so, Aubrey would not only facilitate the students' growth in social skills but also help them become more empathetic, compassionate, and responsible individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Bethesda Says Goodbye to Skyrim, Teases…Something: Wolfenstein Redux? [Updated] You realize figuring out what Bethesda’s up to is basically impossible. That’s by design. No way the publisher of The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim and Fallout 3 and Dishonored is going to tell you what they’re really doing, not when they can send us all off chasing our tails, obsessing over flickering minutia in a teaser video for an upcoming project – said tease authenticated by Bethesda’s Jason Bergman as a tease – like good little post-Lost‘ies. Before we dive in, let’s get the official “What it’s not” out of the way: a new Fallout game, or probably anything to do with Fallout. There. Bethesda’s Pete Hines confirmed as much in response to presumptions that the VINE-based clip of music and barbed wire somehow referenced the retro-post-apocalyptic setting. Fallout 3 arrived over four years ago, and Hines has said the company intends to make further games in the series, but whatever this is, it’s not that (if you want to get technical, I suppose it could still be something Fallout-related, say a spinoff series in the same ‘verse that doesn’t use the Fallout name, but I’d bet not, though hey, a Fallout pre-apocalypse-quel?). Here’s the four-second clip, and yes, the scattershot editing and flashing is there to torture puzzle-lovers: You’re looking at rotating barbed wire, obviously — in fact blue-lit barbed wire, which if we pull out our snobby symbology guides and page to “blue,” suggests the ocean, calm and serenity, which — juxtaposed with oppression, denial of freedom — suggest…okay, I’ll stop. After the barbed wire, you’re looking at a rotating vinyl record referring to The Moonbeam Trio, a musical group (apparently a vocal male sometime trio, sometime quartet) that actually existed back in the 1930s, directed by George Shackley. The record refers to “Planned program service program no. 416,” which Polygon noticed includes songs like “Chanson de Florian” (originally written by Charles Ives) and “Grandfather’s Clock” (a traditional folk song) referring to a real 13-minute, 10-second 33-1/3 LP by “The Moonbeam Trio with organ and violin,” according to WorldCat. Wildly confused? Mission accomplished, Bethesda! That’s followed by a few seconds of — I don’t think sheet music, as some are saying, but a record (label ASG-6939) of Bach’s “Air on the G String,” one of the baroque German composer’s better known pieces from the Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068. If you’ve never heard it, it’s really lovely — I’m partial to classical guitar renditions myself. All the while, we hear the sound of something crackling, like a needle scratching a record, or maybe it’s someone typing on a typewriter and shuffling paper around (hey, I’m assuming nothing — remember, they’re trying to trick us!). Why Bach? That piece in particular? Barbed wire? A sadomasochistic sequel to C.P.U. Bach? This is reaching, but we know Bach was German, and we know German concentration camps employed barbed-wire during the 1930s and 1940s, so if we trip down that road a bit further, what other IP does Bethesda own that involves Germany and World War II? Update: Bethesda just released a second teaser, just as cryptic (if less busy) involving burning sunflowers and someone (face obscured) standing on a landing. Summary:","completion":"Bethesda, the company that made the games Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Dishonored, is teasing a new game.

Q:- Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process involves the deposition of the formed sulfuric acid from the atmosphere back to the Earth's surface, which leads to the phenomenon known as acid rain. Acid rain has notable environmental and ecological consequences, impacting both human-built structures and natural ecosystems. When sulfuric acid in the atmosphere combines with water vapor, it forms fine droplets of acid-containing solution. These droplets can then be transported by wind and weather patterns across long distances, often transcending state or national boundaries. Eventually, these acidic particles fall back to the Earth's surface in the form of precipitation: rain, snow, fog, or even as dry deposition. Acid rain has several negative effects on the environment and human infrastructure. Some of these effects include: 1. Damage to aquatic ecosystems: The increased acidity of the rain causes the pH balance of rivers, lakes, and streams to become more acidic. This change in acidity can have detrimental effects on various aquatic species, such as fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, which are sensitive to changes in pH levels. It can impair reproductive processes and cause the decline of certain species, impacting the overall health of the ecosystem. 2. Damage to terrestrial ecosystems: Acid rain can lead to the leaching of nutrients from the soil, which can negatively impact plant life and tree growth. When the leaching of essential nutrients like calcium and magnesium occurs, it weakens the vegetation and disrupts the natural food chain. Similarly, acid rain can also release harmful substances like aluminum into the soil, which can be toxic to both plants and animals in high concentrations. 3. Damage to human-built structures: Acid rain can corrode and degrade various building materials, such as limestone, marble, and concrete, leading to structural damage and the decline of monuments and historical artifacts. Metallic structures like bridges, pipelines, and vehicles can also suffer from accelerated corrosion due to the acidic conditions created by sulfuric acid particles. 4. Human health risks: Although acid rain itself does not directly affect human health, the particulate matter and sulfur dioxide associated with the formation of acid rain can have respiratory impacts, particularly for individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions. To mitigate the effects of acid rain, governments and industries can implement various strategies, such as regulating sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, promoting renewable energy alternatives, and investing in technologies like flue gas desulfurization systems to reduce sulfur emissions. Additionally, individuals can contribute by conserving energy, reducing the use of fossil fuels, and supporting initiatives aimed at minimizing pollution and preserving the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Article: After studying the daily habits of 177 self-made millionaires over the course of five years, Thomas C. Corley found that they avoid one costly habit: procrastination . \\"It prevents even the most talented individuals from realizing success in life,\\" he writes in his upcoming book, \\"Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.\\" This goes hand-in-hand with author Napoleon Hill's claim that the wealthiest people are also the most decisive people. Out of the 500 millionaires Hill studied in the early 20thcentury, \\"Every one of them had the habit of reaching decisions quickly,\\" Hill wrote in his 1937 classic, \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\" One of the major causes of procrastination is lack of passion, Corley emphasizes: \\"We simply like to do the things we like to do and we put off the things we do not like to do.\\" \\"According to Gallup, only 13% of employees are 'engaged' in their jobs, or emotionally invested in their work,\\" Corley writes. \\"Whether you realize it or not, procrastination is a big reason why you are struggling financially in life. It damages your credibility with employers and fellow colleagues at work. It also affects the quality of your work and this affects the business you or your employer receive from customers, clients, and business relationships.\\" The good news is that anyone can overcome procrastination -- and it's simpler than you may think. He also notes that \\"the voice of procrastination screams just as loud and clear in the minds of those who _ in life as it does in the minds of those who do not.\\" How do they silence it? They rely on \\"to-do\\" lists to get things done. They create firm deadlines, and they meet with \\"accountability partners\\" to ensure they're sticking to their goals and deadlines, Corley says. Nearly everyone is susceptible to procrastination -- but fighting against it can make all the difference. Question: What can people do to overcome procrastination? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Accomplish things on schedule.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, one way to overcome procrastination is to accomplish things on schedule. People can do this by creating to-do lists, setting firm deadlines, and meeting with accountability partners to ensure they are sticking to their goals and deadlines, as mentioned by Thomas C. Corley in his study of self-made millionaires. This helps individuals stay focused, organized, and committed to completing their tasks, ultimately reducing procrastination and improving success in various aspects of life."},{"prompt":"Information: - In Greco-Roman mythology, Aeneas (Greek: , \\"Aineías\\", possibly derived from Greek meaning \\"praised\\") was a Trojan hero, the son of the prince Anchises and the goddess Venus (Aphrodite). His father was a first cousin of King Priam of Troy (both being grandsons of Ilus, founder of Troy), making Aeneas a second cousin to Priam's children (such as Hector and Paris). He is a character in Greek mythology and is mentioned in Homer's \\"Iliad\\". Aeneas receives full treatment in Roman mythology, most extensively in Virgil's \\"Aeneid,\\" where he is an ancestor of Romulus and Remus. He became the first true hero of Rome. Snorri Sturlason identifies him with the Norse Æsir Vidarr. - Publius Vergilius Maro (traditional dates October 15, 70 BC September 21, 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He is known for three acclaimed works of Latin literature, the \\"Eclogues\\" (or \\"Bucolics\\"), the \\"Georgics\\", and the epic \\"Aeneid\\". A number of minor poems, collected in the \\"Appendix Vergiliana\\", are sometimes attributed to him. - Alba Longa (occasionally written Albalonga in Italian sources) was an ancient city of Latium in central Italy, southeast of Rome, in the Alban Hills. Founder and head of the Latin League, it was destroyed by Rome around the middle of the 7th century BC. In legend, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, had come from the royal dynasty of Alba Longa, which in Virgil's Aeneid had been the bloodline of Aeneas, a son of Venus. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Procas or Proca (said to have reigned 817-794 BC) was one of the Latin kings of Alba Longa in the mythic tradition of the founding of Rome. He was the father of Amulius and Numitor and the great grandfather of Romulus and Remus, Rome's legendary founders.. - Aventinus ( said to have reigned 854 - 817 BC ) , one of the mythical kings of Alba Longa , who was buried on the Aventine Hill later named after him . He is said to have reigned thirty - seven years , and to have been succeeded by Procas , the father of Amulius . Servius , in analysing Virgil 's Aeneid , Book vii. 656 , speaks of an Aventinus , a king of the aboriginal inhabitants of Rome , who was killed and buried on the hill afterwards called the Aventine Hill . This king may be conflated with this one or with a separate figure in the Aeneid : \`\` The Aventine is a hill in the city of Rome . It is accepted that it derives its name from birds ( aves ) which , rising from the Tiber , nested there ( as we read in the eighth book of a suitable home for the nests of ill - omened birds ) . This is because of a king of the Aboriginal Italians , Aventinus by name , who was both killed and buried there - just as the Alban king Aventinus was , he who was succeeded by Procas . Varro , however , states that amongst the Roman people , the Sabines accepted this mountain when it was offered them by Romulus , and called it the Aventine after the Aventus river in its area . It is therefore accepted that these different opinions came later , for in the beginning it was called Aventinus after either the birds or the Aboriginal King : from which it is accepted that the son of Hercules mentioned here took his name from that of the hill , not vice versa . '' - In Roman mythology, King Numitor of Alba Longa, was the son of Procas, descendant of Aeneas the Trojan, and father of Rhea Silvia and Lausus - In Roman mythology, Amulius was king of Alba Longa who ordered the death of his infant, twin grandnephews Romulus, the eventual founder and king of Rome, and Remus. He was deposed and killed by them after they survived and grew to adulthood. - The King of Rome was the chief magistrate of the Roman Kingdom. According to legend, the first king of Rome was Romulus, who founded the city in 753 BC upon the Palatine Hill. Seven legendary kings are said to have ruled Rome until 509 BC, when the last king was overthrown. These kings ruled for an average of 35 years.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What were the full name of the person who was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater? , can you please find it? The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.

The film then segues into the September 11 attacks. Moore says Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center on his way to an elementary school. Bush is then shown sitting in a Florida classroom with children. When told that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center and that the nation is \\"under attack\\", Bush allows the students to finish their book reading, and Moore notes that he continued reading for nearly seven minutes. Moore then discusses the complex relationships between the U.S. government and the Bush family; and between the bin Laden family, the Saudi Arabian government, and the Taliban, which span over three decades. Moore alleges that the United States government evacuated 24 members of the bin Laden family on a secret flight shortly after the attacks, without subjecting them to any form of interrogation. Moore moves on to examine George W. Bush's Air National Guard service record. Moore contends that Bush's dry-hole oil well attempts were partially funded by the Saudis and by the bin Laden family through the intermediary of James R. Bath. Moore alleges that these conflicts of interest suggest that the Bush administration does not serve the interests of Americans. The movie continues by suggesting ulterior motives for the War in Afghanistan, including a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean. Moore alleges that the Bush administration induced a climate of fear among the American population through the mass media.

OPT: * yes; * it is not possible to tell; * no;","completion":"It is not possible to tell if the hypothesis \\"There is no stagnation of the national debt interest rate\\" is true based on the given premise. The premise states that the interest rate on the national debt is held constant even when deficits climb and the national saving rate plummets. However, this premise is not enough to assess whether there is stagnation in the national debt interest rate or not. There are other factors and conditions we need to consider in order to reach a definitive conclusion. Stagnation in the national debt interest rate would mean that the rate remains constant over a prolonged period and doesn't respond to changes in economic indicators, such as inflation, economic growth, or monetary policy. The given premise only provides a select snapshot of the national debt interest rate's behavior in specific circumstances, but it does not offer enough information to evaluate its behavior in general. To determine whether the hypothesis is true or false, we would need more information and analysis. For instance, we need to know how the national debt interest rate reacts to different economic indicators and situations over a longer period of time, understand the role of monetary authorities and policy decisions in managing interest rates, and evaluate if the interest rate remains stagnant despite changing macroeconomic conditions. Furthermore, national debt interest rates can be influenced by both domestic and international factors. Interest rates could be affected by investor sentiment, global economic conditions, changes in credit ratings, and risk assessments. These factors would also need to be weighed in order to determine if the interest rate on the national debt is experiencing stagnation or not. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis \\"There is no stagnation of the national debt interest rate\\" is true or false based on the provided premise. A more in-depth analysis covering a wider range of factors, conditions, and situations is necessary to make a well-informed conclusion about the behavior of the national debt interest rate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: philippine stock market outlook to depend on un vote on iraq Text:","completion":"Title: The Future of the Philippine Stock Market Amid the UN Vote on Iraq The Philippine stock market outlook remains uncertain, largely due to the upcoming United Nations (UN) vote concerning Iraq. With the growing concern over the impact of the UN vote on the global political landscape, the investors are taking precautionary steps, anticipating potential fluctuations in the stock market. The Philippine stock market has been consistently growing and showing signs of stability in recent years. However, the recent global events, including the conflict in the Middle East, have been a cause for concern for many investors. The upcoming UN vote on Iraq is of critical importance, as the decision not only affects Iraq but also has the potential to ripple through the international financial markets. The UN vote on Iraq centers around the decision whether to impose sanctions on the country or resort to military intervention. The result of the vote is expected to have significant economic and political consequences. If sanctions are imposed, it could lead to further economic instability in the Middle East, affecting market trends worldwide. On the other hand, if military intervention is chosen as the path forward, it would likely exacerbate tensions between countries and potentially generate more turmoil in the global financial sphere. In the meantime, the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is closely monitoring the situation and preparing for any potential repercussions. Stakeholders in the market are advised to be vigilant and cautious in their investment decisions as the UN vote draws near. It is essential for investors to stay well-informed, keeping track of developments in the global market, in order to make decisions that best protect their financial interests. Several factors contribute to the potential impact of the UN vote on the Philippine stock market. Firstly, the country's economy is highly reliant on remittances from Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), many of whom are based in the Middle East. Any changes in the economic environment in the region could have direct implications on the inflow of remittances to the Philippines. Moreover, the Philippine economy is heavily dependent on oil imports, and a disruption in the supply chain due to sanctions or war could lead to increased energy prices, adversely affecting multiple sectors in the economy. Secondly, the vote outcome might also trigger fluctuations in foreign direct investments (FDIs) in the country. Investor confidence could be affected if the UN vote results in regional instability, leading to capital flight or a decrease in FDIs. Consequently, businesses may choose to hold off on expansion plans or decide to relocate, negatively impacting the stock market. In conclusion, the Philippine stock market outlook is currently contingent on the outcome of the UN vote on Iraq. Both possible outcomes – sanctions or military intervention – have the potential to bring about negative consequences for the Philippines. It is crucial for investors and stakeholders to be mindful of these potential risks and be prepared for fluctuations in the market. By staying informed and making intelligent investment decisions, investors can better navigate the uncertainties that global events can bring to the stock market."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He proposed that he would abstain from voting, and if the other eleven jurors voted guilty unanimously, then he would acquiesce to their decision. However, if at least one... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Juror number eight had an identical knife to the one used in the murder in his pocket.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. Question: \\"Which group plotted the assassination of Hosni Mubarak?\\" Response: \\"Bin Laden\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"The response to the question is not factually correct.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (commonly abbreviated as E. T. A. Hoffmann; born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 - 25 June 1822) was a Prussian Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic, draftsman and caricaturist. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker is based. The ballet Coppelia is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's Kreisleriana is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler. Context: The next fifteen months were some of the worst in Hoffmann's life. The city of Berlin was also occupied by Napoleon's troops. Obtaining only meagre allowances, he had frequent recourse to his friends, constantly borrowing money and still going hungry for days at a time; he learned that his daughter had died. Nevertheless, he managed to compose his Six Canticles for a cappella choir: one of his best compositions, which he would later attribute to Kreisler in Lebensansichten des Katers Murr. On 1 September 1808 he arrived with his wife in Bamberg, where he began a job as theatre manager. The director, Count Soden, left almost immediately for Wurzburg, leaving a man named Heinrich Cuno in charge. Hoffmann was unable to improve standards of performance, and his efforts caused intrigues against him which resulted in him losing his job to Cuno. He began work as music critic for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, a newspaper in Leipzig, and his articles on Beethoven were especially well received, and highly regarded by the composer himself. It was in its pages that the \\"Kapellmeister Johannes Kreisler\\" character made his first appearance. Hoffmann's breakthrough came in 1809, with the publication of Ritter Gluck, a story about a man who meets, or believes he has met, the composer Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-87) more than twenty years after the latter's death. The theme alludes to the work of Jean Paul, who invented the term Doppelganger the previous decade, and continued to exact a powerful influence over Hoffmann, becoming one of his earliest admirers. With this publication, Hoffmann began to use the pseudonym E. T. A. Hoffmann, telling people that the \\"A\\" stood for Amadeus, in homage to the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-91). However, he continued to use Wilhelm in official documents throughout his life, and the initials E. T. W. also appear on his gravestone. The next year, he was employed at the Bamberg Theatre as stagehand, decorator, and playwright, while also giving private music lessons. He became so enamored of a young singing student, Julia Marc, that his feelings were obvious whenever they were together, and Julia's mother quickly found her a more suitable match. When Joseph Seconda offered Hoffmann a position as musical director for his opera company (then performing in Dresden), he accepted, leaving on 21 April 1813. Question: what did he do during this time? Answer:","completion":"During this time, E.T.A. Hoffmann went through some tough moments in his life. He didn't have much money and sometimes would go hungry for days. But he still managed to compose beautiful music, like his Six Canticles for a cappella choir. After moving to Bamberg, he worked as a theatre manager, but faced some challenges and lost his job. Then, he became a music critic for a newspaper, where he wrote about famous composers like Beethoven. He also created a character named Johannes Kreisler in his articles. In 1809, he published a story called Ritter Gluck and started using the pseudonym E.T.A. Hoffmann. Later, he worked at the Bamberg Theatre, doing many jobs like stagehand, decorator, and playwright, and gave private music lessons too. He fell in love with a student named Julia, but her mother found her a different match. Finally, he accepted a job as a musical director for an opera company in Dresden, leaving Bamberg in 1813."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels happens, how will it affect the isotope loses aromic particles faster. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned is about the increased absorption of oxygen by small blood vessels. However, this scenario would not have any direct or indirect effect on the process of an isotope losing atomic particles, decaying, and emitting radiation. The process you described is known as radioactive decay, which is a naturally occurring phenomenon that depends solely on the inherent properties of the unstable isotope itself. Radioactive decay is a random process, and the rate at which an isotope decays is determined by its half-life, which is a constant value specific to each isotope. This process does not depend on external factors such as the presence or absorption of oxygen. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis you suggested has no effect on the radioactive decay process of an isotope. The decay of isotopes and their emission of radiation are solely determined by their atomic properties and not influenced by external factors like oxygen absorption in the blood vessels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But they may nearly all be wrong - and staying away from bread could do more harm than good, a panel of experts has warned. They argue that research has shown bread produces less bloating than pasta, and what makes us fat is not the sandwich, but the filling. Unfairly maligned: Experts say bread doesn't cause bloating - but the fatty fillings many of us adore may cause weight gain. Moreover, while bread is often singled. out as a bloating culprit, the evidence continues to show that this is. more perception than reality. The list of celebrities who refuse to touch gluten is long. Gwyneth won't let it pass her lips and Madonna swears avoiding gluten is what keeps her young. Although 98 per cent of Britons say they. eat bread, many blame it for bloating and weight gain, and think they. would be better off going gluten-free. And while 20 per cent think it’s important to eat gluten and wheat-free, just 0.5 per cent of the population has gluten intolerance. This means many could be losing out on vital nutrition such as fibre, iron and calcium by avoiding bread. Banned by the A-list: Many celebrities, such as Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow, claim they maintain their trim figures by avoiding gluten-containing products, such as bread. In fact, gluten free products can. actually be higher in additives, saturated fat and sugar, Ayela Spiro. from the British Nutrition Foundation, told a London conference of. dieticians and nutritionists discussing bloating this month at King's College London. She also cited a new (as yet. unpublished) study from the University of Bristol, which showed bread. produced less physically measurable abdominal bloating than a pasta. meal, despite diners saying they expected the bread would bloat. them more. Sue Baic, of the British Dietetic Association, added it is a common misconception that bread is fattening - 'it's what goes on the bread that is most harmful to our waistlines,' she argued. Hidden enemy: Fatty sandwich fillings such as egg mayo are more likely to cause weight gain than the bread that surrounds them, experts say. Two. average slices of bread provide around 190 calories and 2g of fat, but spreading margarine or butter on them almost doubles the calories. (334 calories) and adds 16g fat. Furthermore, the. nation’s favourite sandwich filling – egg mayonnaise – provides just under. 600 calories and a huge 34g of fat, which is almost half the recommended. daily intake for a woman. Ms Baic added that many people assume white bread is bad for us, but this is not the case, saying: 'The half and half types such as Hovis Best of Both, that look. and taste like white but combine white and wholemeal flours can contain. 75 per cent of the fibre content of wholemeal.' 'As well as being a good source of calcium, iron and fibre, two slices. of bread contain 20-30 per cent of our recommended nutrient intake of. vitamin B1 [and other vital nutrients]. 'At just 5-10p per two slice serving it’s a very. inexpensive way to get some good nutrition in your diet.' Lesser thief: Bread was found to be less bloating than a bowl of pasta. So if it’s not bread that causes bloating, what does? Gastroenterologist, psychotherapist and medical adviser to the IBS Network, Dr Nick Read said that 'bloaters' may just be more sensitive to the feeling of abdominal gas, but not actually produce more of it. 'Possible risk factors for bloating include obesity, anxiety or depression, being inactive, constipated or premenstrual, and, in those with irritable bowel syndrome, eating too many fermentable carbohydrate sources in general, not just wheat,' he added. For example, some people with IBS may react with bloating on consumption of wheat but this is possibly more likely due to the presence of fructans found in many foods including onions, artichokes, asparagus and leeks rather than gluten, the panel concluded. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. Bread is often unfairly blamed for bloating and weight gain, with many people believing that they should avoid it and go gluten-free. However, only 0.5% of the population actually has gluten intolerance, and avoiding bread may lead to a lack of vital nutrients such as fibre, iron, and calcium. 2. Celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna endorse avoiding gluten, but the truth is that gluten-free products can actually be higher in additives, saturated fat, and sugar than bread. 3. Research from the University of Bristol shows that bread produced less abdominal bloating than pasta, despite people's expectations. Sue Baic from the British Dietetic Association states that bread is not fattening, but rather, the added ingredients and fillings contribute to weight gain and potential bloating. 4. Two average slices of bread provide around 190 calories and 2g of fat, but adding butter or margarine significantly increases the calorie content. High-calorie sandwich fillings, such as egg mayonnaise, can contribute to weight gain more than the bread itself. 5. Contrary to popular belief, white bread is not inherently bad for us and can provide key nutrients like calcium, iron, and fibre. Some half and half bread varieties containing both white and wholemeal flours can have up to 75% of wholemeal's fibre content. 6. Bloating can be caused by a variety of factors, such as obesity, anxiety, depression, inactivity, constipation, or premenstrual issues. Gastroenterologist Dr. Nick Read suggests that some people may be more sensitive to the feeling of abdominal gas, but not necessarily produce more of it. Bloating from wheat may not be caused by gluten, but by the presence of fructans found in several other foods."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, Agrippina.

Coca-Cola is introducing a line of fruit-flavored seltzer waters called Fruitwater on April 1. The drink... (Associated Press) Coca-Cola is taking bottled water and doing what it does best _ giving it some bubbles and flavor. The Atlanta-based company confirmed Monday that it would introduce a line of zero-calorie, carbonated, fruit-flavored waters called \\"Fruitwater\\" starting April 1. The drink will be part of Coca-Cola's Glaceau unit, which makes other pricier bottled waters such as Vitaminwater and Smartwater. Unlike the zero-calorie version of Vitaminwater, which is made with the natural sweetener stevia, Fruitwater will be sweetened with the artificial sweetener sucralose, best known as Splenda. It will not contain any fruit juice but the bottle notes that the drink is \\"enhanced with nutrients,\\" a reference to its B vitamins, magnesium and zinc. The rollout was first reported by the trade journal Beverage Digest. Such an \\"unsoda,\\" fizzy and sweetened but packaged like bottled water, could lure people who are looking for an alternative to sugary carbonated drinks. Soft drink consumption has slid in the U.S. since the late 1990s. The decline has been attributed to growing concerns about obesity, as well as the proliferation of options such bottled teas and flavored waters. Industry executives have nevertheless expressed optimism about sparking a turnaround in the soft drink category with better-tasting, lower-calorie options, noting that Americans love fizzy drinks. Still, Coca-Cola has diversified its portfolio as drinking habits change. In 2007, it paid 4.1 billion for Glaceau, which was then its largest ever acquisition. Executives noted at the time that the price would be worth it for the rapidly growing brand. Overall sales volume for Glaceau rose 4 percent last year, according to Beverage Digest. Zero-calorie varieties have performed far more strongly, suggesting people are increasingly watching how much sugar they drink. Vitaminwater with zero calories was up almost 4 percent, and Smartwater, which is marketed as a premium plain water, was up 25 percent. Regular Vitaminwater _ which has about 125 calories in a 16-ounce bottle because it is sweetened with sugar _ was down 8 percent. Although Coca-Cola Co. also owns Dasani bottled water, premium bottled waters that promise health benefits or added flavors are generally more profitable because they can fetch higher prices. But the marketing for Vitaminwater has resulted in some trouble for Coca-Cola as well, with a nutrition advocacy group suing the company over what it called \\"deceptive\\" health claims that the drinks can reduce the risk of disease. A representative for the Center for Science in the Public Interest said it's still awaiting a judge's ruling on a motion seeking class-action status for the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, Lindsey Raivich, said Fruitwater will come in a specially contoured 16.9-ounce (479-gram) bottle. It will cost 1 to 1.25 and come in black raspberry, orange mango, strawberry kiwi, lemon lime and watermelon punch. Raivich said the company is planning a formal announcement closer to the launch date. Although no TV ads are planned, she said the marketing campaign including radio, print and in-store promotions. ||||| It wasn't too long ago that America had a love affair with soda.

As sugary drinks come under fire for fueling obesity... (Associated Press) As New York City grapples with the legality of a ban on the sale of large cups of soda and other sugary drinks at some businesses, one thing is clear: soda's run as the nation's beverage of choice has fizzled. In its place? A favorite for much of history: Plain old H2O. For more than two decades, soda was the No. 1 drink in the U.S. with per capita consumption peaking in 1998 at 54 gallons a year, according industry tracker Beverage Digest. Americans drank just 42 gallons a year of water at the time. But over the years, as soda increasingly came under fire for fueling the nation's rising obesity rates, water quietly rose to knock it off the top spot. Americans now drink an average of 44 gallons of soda a year, a 17 percent drop from the peak in 1998. Over the same time, the average amount of water people drink has increased 38 percent to about 58 gallons a year. Bottled water has led that growth, with consumption nearly doubling to 21 gallons a year. Stephen Ngo, a civil defense attorney, quit drinking soda a year ago when he started running triathlons, and wanted a healthier way to quench his thirst. Ngo, 34, has a Brita filter for tap water and also keeps his pantry stocked with cases of bottled water. \\"It might just be the placebo effect or marketing, but it tastes crisper,\\" said Ngo, who lives in Miami. The trend reflects Americans' ever-changing tastes; it wasn't too far back in history that tap water was the top drink. But in the 1980s, carbonated soft drinks overtook tap as the most popular drink, with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo putting their marketing muscle behind their colas with celebrity endorsements from the likes of pop star Michael Jackson and comedian Bill Cosby. Americans kept drinking more of the carbonated, sugary drink for about a decade. Then, soda's magic started to fade: Everyone from doctors to health advocates to government officials were blaming soft drinks for making people fat. Consumption started declining after hitting a high in the late 1990s. At the same time, people started turning to bottled water as an alternative. Its popularity was helped by the emergence of single-serve bottles that were easy to carry around. Until then, bottled water had mainly been sold in \\"big jugs and coolers\\" for people who didn't trust their water supply, said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest. The new soft drink-like packaging helped fast-track bottled water's growth past milk and beer. In fact, the amount of bottled water Americans drink has risen nearly every year for more than two decades, while the estimates of how much tap water people drink has fluctuated up and down during that time. When taken together, water finally overtook soda in 2008, according to Beverage Digest. (It's difficult to track how much tap water people drink and how much is used for other things like washing dishes, so experts estimate consumption.) Analysts expect water to hold onto to its top spot for years to come. But whether people will drink from the tap or a bottle is uncertain. Based on current trajectories, Michael Bellas, the CEO of the industry tracker Beverage Marketing Corp., predicts that bottled water alone could overtake soda within the next decade. That's not counting enhanced and flavored waters, which are growing quickly but remain a small part of the bottled water industry. Currently, people drink 21 gallons of bottled water a year. That compares with 37 gallons of other water, which includes tap, sparkling, flavored and enhanced waters such as Coca-Cola's vitaminwater. But there are numerous factors that could tilt the scales in favor of tap water. Because of concerns that plastic bottles create too much waste, experts say bottled water could be hit by a public backlash similar to the one that has whipsawed the soda industry with pushes for bans and taxes. New York City was preparing for a ban on cups of sugary drinks that are larger than 16 ounces starting on Tuesday. But on Monday _ a day before the ban was to begin _ a judge invalidated the regulation. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who originally proposed the ban, vowed to appeal the judge's ruling. Bottled water already is starting to face similar opposition. The town of Concord, Mass. earlier this year banned the sale of water bottles that are less than a liter. And the University of Vermont became the first public university to ban the sale of bottled water last year. Meanwhile, other cities are waging campaigns to promote tap water. New York City, which touts the high quality of its tap water, offers portable fountains at events around the city. \\"Good old marketing has convinced people that they should spend a lot of money on bottled water,\\" says Salome Freud, chief of New York City's distribution water quality operations. Although companies such as Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. would rather have people buy bottled waters, they're even more invested in getting people to drink more soda again. That's because soda and other drinks that the companies make, such as sports drinks and juices, are more profitable than bottled water. With bottled water, people tend to buy whatever is cheapest. That's a habit that forces companies to keep prices relatively low, which eats into profits. It's why companies are investing so heavily in developing nations such as China and India, where the appetite for soda continues to grow. In the U.S., annual soda sales are more than five times as big as bottled water at 75.7 billion a year, according to Beverage Digest. In terms of volume, soda is only twice as big as bottled water. At Coca-Cola, the No. 1 soda maker, three-quarters of its volume in gallons comes from soft drinks, compared with 8 percent for its bottled waters including Dasani. PepsiCo, the No. 2 soda maker, gets 64 percent of its volume from soft drinks and only 7 percent from its Aquafina bottled water. It's why Coca-Cola, which holds 13 percent of the bottled water market compared with PepsiCo's 10 percent, doesn't seem to think bottled water will ever overtake soda. In an emailed statement, the Atlanta-based company noted that soft drinks remain a far larger category than bottled water and that it sees \\"upside\\" for sodas over the next several years. However, the company added that it saw \\"great potential\\" for bottled water. Like its competitors, Coca-Cola said it's focusing on growing its portfolio of bottled waters profitably by offering brands such as Smartwater and its flavored vitaminwater, which fetch higher prices. In the meantime, the chairman and former CEO of Nestle Waters North America, Kim Jeffery, is waiting for bottled water's moment in the spotlight. Nestle, the Swiss company that makes Poland Spring, Nestle Pure Life, Deer Park and other brands, has nearly half of the share of the bottled water market. At a beverage industry conference late last year, Jeffery noted that bottled water is \\"the elephant in the room.\\" And given the growing warnings over drinking too many calories _ including from juice, milk and other sugary drinks _ Jeffery said he's confident that water will continue to grow in popularity. \\"For thousands of years, water was beverage of choice for human beings,\\" he said. \\"Now we're reverting back to that.\\" __ Follow Candice Choi at http://www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something.

The AP reports that the DOJ filed the appeal Thursday in a bid to block the deal, which federal officials argue would make the television market less competitive and less innovative. Last month, US District Judge Richard Leon disagreed, ruling against the government's argument that the phone and pay-TV giant's 81 billion takeover of the entertainment conglomerate would hurt competition, limit choices and jack up prices for consumers to stream TV and movies. Per CNBC, AT&T has argued since announcing the megamerger in 2016 that it would help the company compete against Amazon and Netflix. Article:","completion":"Last month, a seismic ruling allowed the 81 billion merger between telecommunications giant AT&T and entertainment conglomerate Time Warner to proceed. This month, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) responded, challenging the ruling by filing an appeal, as it continues to position the move as detrimental for competition, consumer choices, and innovation in the television market. The Associated Press (AP) reports that the DOJ commenced the appeal process Thursday, reinforcing its stance on the potentially damaging impact of the merger. The federal government has persistently insisted that the massive conglomerate formed by the merger between AT&T, a leading phone and pay-TV provider, and Time Warner, an entertainment powerhouse, would have a detrimental effect on the television market. Their primary arguments focus on the fear that this merger could severely limit diversity in the sector and could lead to increased prices for consumers wishing to stream TV and movies. By concentrating such power and influence within one entity, officials argue, the playing field becomes uneven and much less competitive. This merger would effectively enable AT&T to control some of the most valuable and sought-after content available via Time Warner’s portfolio which includes HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros., potentially leading to consumers facing higher costs to access their favourite shows and movies. However, in opposition to the government's arguments, AT&T has long insisted that this merger is not a threat but a necessary evolution. They have positioned the merger since 2016 as a strategic move to help them compete against formidable streaming giants like Amazon and Netflix. Last month, US District Judge Richard Leon sided with AT&T in his ruling. Judge Leon disagreed with the government's allegations regarding the merger and its potential impact on competition and consumer prices. As streaming services continue to balloon in popularity and user numbers, traditional cable TV is facing a steep uphill battle. Consumers increasingly prefer the control and convenience of streaming, which offers precise selection and viewing on demand, unlike traditional broadcasting. AT&T argues that acquiring Time Warner, including its wealth of content, would arm them with the necessary tools to compete with the behemoth streaming services Amazon and Netflix. AT&T believes that with Time Warner's assets under its umbrella, it can provide an attractive alternative that can lure customers in a market dominated by streaming giants. While the DOJ's appeal represents a significant hurdle for AT&T and Time Warner, it is not a definitive conclusion. The appeal process could take months and may eventually land the case in the Supreme Court. Until then, the debate will continue, presenting a seminal case in American business history fitting for our digital age. This case will set a significant precedent for future mergers and acquisitions in the rapidly evolving landscape of media, technology, and telecommunications. As the landscape continues to evolve, consumers, businesses, and the government alike will closely watch AT&T's merger with Time Warner and its potential impact. This case may ultimately determine whether mergers of this scale and character can coexist with the principles of competitive fairness and consumer choice or potentially reshape them entirely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combining them gives: (112n - 151n) = -39n So the equation now becomes: -39n + 16962 = -193n - 1980 Step 2: Move all the terms with the variable n to one side of the equation and all the constant terms to the other side. To do that, we can add 193n to both sides to move the n terms to the left side: -39n + 193n + 16962 = -193n + 193n - 1980 (193n - 39n) = 154n Now we have: 154n + 16962 = -1980 Next, we will move the constant term 16962 to the right side by subtracting it from both sides: 154n = -1980 - 16962 Calculating -1980 - 16962 gives -18942. Now, the equation is: 154n = -18942 Step 3: Solve for n. Now that we have an equation with n on one side, we can solve for n by dividing both sides by the coefficient of n, which is 154: n = -18942 / 154 Dividing -18942 by 154 gives us: n ≈ -123 So the solution to the equation is n ≈ -123."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The Gestapo, abbreviation of Geheime Staatspolizei, or the Secret State Police, was the official secret police of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Diary of a Young Girl (also known as The Diary of Anne Frank) is a book of the writings from the Dutch language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only known survivor just after the war was over. The diary has since been published in more than 60 languages. - Annelies Marie Frank (12 June 1929 February or March 1945) was a German-born diarist. One of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust, she gained fame posthumously following the publication of \\"The Diary of a Young Girl\\" (originally \\"Het Achterhuis\\"), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. It is one of the world's most widely known books and has been the basis for several plays and films. - Edith Frank (née Holländer; 16 January 1900 6 January 1945) was the mother of Holocaust diarist Anne Frank. She died from starvation at the age of 44, ten days before her 45th birthday. - Margot Betti Frank ( 16 February 1926 -- February 1945 ) was the elder daughter of Otto and Edith Frank and the older sister of Anne Frank .

Created as a hard rock band named Tricky Beans, they later changed to Tricky Means and finally to Sonata Arctica, when they shifted to power metal. The current line-up consists of singer, keyboardist and songwriter Tony Kakko, guitarist Elias Viljanen, bass guitarist Pasi Kauppinen, keyboardist and keytarist Henrik Klingenberg, and drummer Tommy Portimo. All the musicians of the band's history except Portimo also acted as backing vocalists. Context: On May 25, 2007, Unia was released. The album's first single, \\"Paid In Full\\", was released on April 27, 2007. On August 6, 2007, the band announced on their website that guitarist Jani Liimatainen had been asked to leave the band due to problems related to his conscription. He was replaced by Elias Viljanen who had already filled in for him in the band's Finnish and Japanese shows during the spring and summer. In October 2007 Sonata Arctica headlined the ProgPower USA VIII. Later the band supported Nightwish across their 2008 tour of United States and Canada and headlined at the shows that Nightwish cancelled due to Anette Olzon's sudden severe sickness. It was announced on September 4, 2008 that the band's first two albums would be re-released with bonus tracks by Spinefarm UK on October 6. The Days of Grays was released on September 16, 2009 in Finland and September 22 in the USA. Henrik stated that the new album would be in the same vein as Unia, but not as complex and darker. Singles from this album include \\"Flag in the Ground\\" and \\"The Last Amazing Grays\\". On August 28, 2009, the music video of \\"Flag In The Ground\\" was released to the web. The limited 2CD European edition of the album featured many of the album tracks with all instruments performed by a symphony orchestra. The band also toured with DragonForce for the third U.S. leg of the Ultra Beatdown. In early 2010 they engaged on an Australian tour with Ensiferum and Melbourne band Vanishing Point. In April 2010, Sonata Arctica embarked on their USA and Canada Headlining tour for The Days of Grays. In October they headlined in Chile in support of the same album.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Granmamare for the following movie plot: Brunhilde is a fish-girl who lives with her father Fujimoto, a once-human wizard/scientist who now lives underwater, along with her numerous smaller sisters. One day, while she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler (the net of which is scraping the trash-strewn bottom of the harbor), she ends up stuck in a glass jar. She drifts to the shore of a small fishing town and is found and rescued by a small boy named SÅsuke. Shattering the jar open with a nearby rock, SÅsuke cuts his finger in the process. Brunhilde licks his wound when he picks her up and the wound heals almost instantly, much to his surprise. After taking a great liking to her, and thinking her merely a goldfish, SÅsuke renames her Ponyo and promises to protect her forever. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his taken daughter. Because of his own bad memories of the human world, he believes that SÅsuke has kidnapped her and that she is in great danger, he calls his wave spirits to recover her. After the wave spirits retrieve Ponyo from SÅsuke, the boy is heartbroken. He goes home with his mother, Lisa, who tries to cheer him up. Back underwater, Ponyo and Fujimoto have an argument, during which Ponyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth-name, \\"Brunhilde\\". She declares her name to be Ponyo and voices her desire to become human, because she has started to fall in love with SÅsuke. Suddenly, using her magic, she forces herself to grow leg and arm-like appendages and start changing into a human, a power granted to her by the human blood she ingested when she licked SÅsuke's finger. Her alarmed father forces her to change back into her true form with some difficulty and goes to summon Ponyo's mother, Granmamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and in the chaos inadvertently uses her magic to make herself fully human.... Answer:","completion":"In the film, which character is Ponyo's mother, who is summoned by Fujimoto to help address Ponyo's transformation and desire to become human, after Ponyo forcefully turns herself partially human with the help of her newfound magical abilities?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Evolutionary biology is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth, starting from a single common ancestor. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation. The discipline emerged through what Julian Huxley called the modern synthesis (of the 1930s) of understanding from several previously unrelated fields of biological research, including genetics, ecology, systematics and paleontology. Current research has widened to cover the genetic architecture of adaptation, molecular evolution, and the different forces that contribute to evolution including sexual selection, genetic drift and biogeography. The newer field of evolutionary developmental biology (\\"evo-devo\\") investigates how embryonic development is controlled, thus creating a wider synthesis that integrates developmental biology with the fields covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis. Evolution is the central unifying concept in biology. Biology can be divided in various ways. One way is by the level of biological organisation, from molecular to cell, organism to population. An earlier way is by perceived taxonomic group, with fields such as zoology, botany, and microbiology, reflecting what were once seen as the major divisions of life. A third way is by approach, such as field biology, theoretical biology, experimental evolution, and paleontology. These alternative ways of dividing up the subject can be combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology.

One way to split evolutionary biology is by the level of biological organization, such as molecular, cellular, organismal, or population levels. 5. An example of studying evolution at the molecular level is researching the role of specific genes in the process of adaptation. 6.

At first, Bohr thought that this was the angular momentum of each electron in an atom: this proved incorrect and, despite developments by Sommerfeld and others, an accurate description of the electron angular momentum proved beyond the Bohr model. The correct quantization rules for electrons – in which the energy reduces to the Bohr model equation in the case of the hydrogen atom – were given by Heisenberg's matrix mechanics in 1925 and the Schrödinger wave equation in 1926: the reduced Planck constant remains the fundamental quantum of angular momentum. In modern terms, if J is the total angular momentum of a system with rotational invariance, and Jz the angular momentum measured along any given direction, these quantities can only take on the values Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Who helped to give the incorrect quantization rules for electrons in 1946?","completion":"Okay, let me explain it for you like you're five years old. Bohr was a smart person who tried to explain how tiny things called electrons move around in something even tinier called atoms. He thought he found the rule for how electrons move, but it wasn't perfect. Other smart people, like Sommerfeld, tried to make it better, but they still didn't get the answer right. Then, two more smart people named Heisenberg and Schrödinger came along and figured out the correct rules for how electrons move. They used something called the reduced Planck constant to help them understand the electrons' movements. As for the question about who gave the incorrect rules in 1946, I cannot find any information about this. So to answer your question, it is unanswerable."},{"prompt":"Q:Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\".

One day, while in the shower, she sees herself at a strange asylum. As she walks she finds that she is dressed in a nun's habit with a nametag saying Amanda Krueger. She is then attacked by patients at the hospital but wakes up before anything happens. The next day Alice is graduating from high school alongside her new friends consisting of Greta, an aspiring (albeit, reluctant) supermodel, Mark, a comic book geek and Yvonne, a candy striper who is also a swimmer. She only confides her nightmare to Dan, after he tells her about a trip to Europe. He tells her she is in control of her dreams, and she goes to work. While on her way to work, Alice finds herself back at the asylum, where she witnesses Amanda giving birth to a gruesomely deformed Freddy-looking baby. Amanda tries to collect the baby before it escapes, but it sneaks out of the operating room and Alice follows it into the same church where she had defeated Freddy in the previous film. The baby finds Freddy's remains and quickly grows into an adult, hinting to Alice that he's found the \\"key\\" to coming back before waking her up. Alarmed, she contacts Dan, who leaves the pool party. He falls asleep en route and is attacked by Freddy who sends him back to the pool. Leaving again, he finds a motorcycle which he uses to try to get to Alice. Freddy possesses the bike and injects Dan with wires, fills him with fuel and electrocutes him, turning him into a frightful creature before veering him into oncoming traffic. Hearing the explosion of Dan's vehicle impacting with a semi-truck, Alice runs out and sees his body come to life and taunt her before she passes out. Waking in a hospital, she has to take the news of Dan's death and that she is pregnant with his child.

Here is a goal: dry spent grain How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Drying spent grain is a crucial process in turning the residual byproduct from brewing or distilling, such as malted barley, into a versatile, more manageable and economically valuable commodity, which can be used, for example, in the production of animal feed. The primary objective of drying spent grain is to reduce its moisture content, making it more useful, less perishable, and easier to transport. Below is a step-by-step guide to accomplish this goal: 1. Collection and preparation: Gather the spent grain immediately after the brewing or distilling process to ensure minimal deterioration and microbial contamination. Ensure that the spent grain is somewhat homogenous by breaking down large clusters and removing impurities such as larger foreign matters or noticeably spoiled pieces. 2. Moisture measurement: Determine the initial moisture content of the spent grain either through basic methods (e.g., using a moisture meter) or more advanced techniques (e.g., gravimetric analysis). This information is significant for the drying process, as the target dryness and required drying time are contingent on the starting moisture content. 3. Choose the drying method: There are different methods for drying spent grain, such as sun drying, rotary drum drying, flash drying, belt drying, and fluidized bed drying. The selection of the drying method should be based on factors such as available equipment, energy efficiency, scale of drying, and material characteristics. The chosen method should remove moisture evenly and maintain the nutritional value of the grain. 4. Dry spent grain: a) For sun drying: Spread the spent grain thinly and uniformly on a clean, flat surface (preferably in trays), and expose it to direct sunlight. Sun drying is a simple, low-cost method but may take several days, depending on the weather and available surface area. Stir the spent grain occasionally throughout the day to encourage uniform drying. Monitor the moisture content intermittently, and when it reaches the desired level, move on to storage. b) For other drying methods (e.g., rotary drum, flash drying, etc.): Follow the manufacturer's instructions and guidelines for the specific equipment. Make sure to operate it optimally. Monitor the moisture content and temperature levels regularly to ensure even drying and avoid overheating or under-drying. Continuously assess the spent grain until it reaches the desired moisture level. 5. Cooling: Once the spent grain has reached the desired moisture content, it is vital to let it cool down before storage. The cooling process should be gradual to avoid condensation within the material, which can reintroduce unnecessary moisture. Spreading the grain in a thin layer on a flat surface or using air cooling methods can help expedite this process. 6. Storage: When the spent grain is dried and cooled, it must be stored in a well-ventilated area, free from moisture, pests, and contaminants. Using sealed, moisture-proof containers or bags can help keep the dry spent grain in optimal condition. Be sure to label the containers with relevant information like the date of drying and the moisture content. 7. Evaluate the quality and nutrient retention: Finally, it is essential to assess the final dried product and its quality, including parameters such as moisture content, protein content, and microbial load. Ensuring the nutritional value hasn't been significantly compromised during the drying process is crucial in determining its suitability for animal feed or other applications. In conclusion, the appropriate drying of spent grain is imperative in turning the high-moisture byproduct into a valuable resource. The drying process requires careful monitoring and control, along with choosing the right drying technology. Beyond the drying stage, proper cooling and storage contribute to maintaining quality and preserving the nutritional profile for future use or repurposing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Instructions: Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. Input: Hi, so I am 15 years old and for most of my life my parents have constantly argued every single day and they tell each other all the time they want a divorce, they aren’t happy, their a terrible partner, and etc. I hate hearing them argue out of the blue over pointless things, and most of the time it’s my mom screaming at my dad for unreasonable things and for awhile I never got involved, I would just try to cancel out the noise when I was little. But over the course of a few years the arguing never gets easier to hear, despite my wishes for it to be. So I started to intersect in their arguments which may not be wise because it’s ultimately between them but sometimes it gets too hard to listen to. Anyways, so a couple of years ago I had an argument with my mom that I always tend to think about. One day I found messages that my mom sent another man that were sexual and they were talking about a meet up and etc. This also isn’t the first time I’ve seen questionable messages that she has sent to another man, the first time I was really young maybe around 9 and I brought it up to my dad and my mom told me to tell my dad it was a joke. So anyways that second time I found messages I was really angry and I texted my dad everything and sent him pictures of everything. I was also being impulsive and messaged my mom and told her what I found and how it was stupid of her to waste all of my dad’s time to be with her if she’s in an unhappy relationship. So my mom got home and went apeshit on me and basically was telling me how that’s just how people talk and that my dad and her were fine before I got in the way and started telling him this stuff. So for awhile after that I’ve kept trying to tell my dad to just get a divorce because he’s always complaining about my mom, and I hate that they bring me into their problems and complain about each other to me as it affects me too. But my dad keeps telling me once he has a stable job he’ll leave (my mom is the breadwinner in my family) and I was recently told my mom would have gotten a divorce with my dad if she wasn’t at risk to lose things that she’s worked hard for. Every time I intersect one of their arguments it’s always my mom bringing up stupid little things to my dad and I tend to be very blunt and harsh towards her because what she’s screaming to my dad about is not important. For example, my dad went out for lunch today with his brother (she also went out for lunch yesterday with a friend) and my mom created this huge deal out of it and turned it into she does everything and he does nothing. Which could be farther from the truth, my whole life my dad has supported my brother always trying to make us happy. So every single time my mom brings up a small thing and creates it into an argument I always tell her that she does the exact same thing and she’s being extremely hypocritical for screaming at him for doing something she did yesterday. Every time I tell her how hypocritical and immature she’s being she starts turning it around on me telling me that I’m ungrateful, unappreciative, entitled and etc. Now I feel like I’m always being bitchy to my mom which I hate doing but every time I try to have a conversation with her she turns it into how my dad does nothing everyday. So I keep telling my dad to just leave and I tell my mom to just leave and neither of them do it, despite them always saying they want to. Overall, basically what I’m trying to get at is that I’ve been trying to get my parents to divorce for a couple years now and I’ve told close friends that I have and they all think I’m fucked up for trying to ruin a marriage, but I honestly believe that it’s been ruined for a while and I just want them to finally get the happiness they want and be with other people. I love both of my parents I appreciate everything they’ve ever done for me and the support they’ve given me throughout my life. But growing up in this type of household of hearing constant screaming every single day has affected me so much and I just want them to get a divorce and be happy. But I don’t want to rule out other possibilities that I might not understand, for example perhaps they have some sort of arrangement or decision, or maybe they don’t want to get a divorce because I’m still just a kid to them (I’ve brought up that I understand divorce to them and they shouldn’t not get a divorce because of me.) Honestly I wish this wasn’t how I felt about their relationship, I would love to have parents who are together forever, but I want to be realistic about this which is understanding they shouldn’t be together despite my wish for them to be. Anyways, am I the asshole for wanting my parents to divorce? Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the main event/root cause of the situation.

Jeff Jenkins (40), a recently divorced and unemployed father, is doing his best to make ends meet while raising his teenage daughter, Emily, and young son, Tommy. The Mayor, Charles Thompson (55), was elected on the promise of bringing positive change to the town. However, under his watch, corruption, deceit, and the increasing burden on the residents have become more apparent. Act 2: As the town's situation becomes seemingly hopeless, a mysterious, influential investor named Victor Martinez (50) approaches the community with a proposition of a new investment project promising to bring life and jobs back to New Deal. The town's population is excited, and the majority of them support the proposal without any skepticism. Jeff, however, is dubious about Victor's intentions and begins investigating his background and the true nature of the investment project. As Jeff uncovers more about the investor's corrupt past, he discovers that Victor's plan is a front for illegal activities and aims to exploit the people and resources of New Deal for personal gain. Act 3: With the help of a local reporter, Karen Thompson (35), who also happens to be the estranged daughter of Mayor Thompson, Jeff assembles substantial evidence against Victor and reveals his plan to the local law enforcement and townspeople. In a climactic showdown, Jeff confronts Victor in front of the entire community during a town hall meeting.

The series and several episode scripts were adapted from the \\"Dobie Gillis\\" short stories written by Max Shulman since 1945, and first collected in 1951 under the same title as the subsequent TV series. Shulman also wrote a feature film adaptation of his \\"Dobie Gillis\\" stories for MGM in 1953, entitled \\"The Affairs of Dobie Gillis\\". - William Joseph Schallert (July 6, 1922 May 8, 2016) was an American character actor who appeared in many films and in such television series as \\"; \\"Perry Mason; The Smurfs\\"; \\"Jefferson Drum\\"; \\"Philip Marlowe\\"; \\"The Rat Patrol\\"; \\"Gunsmoke\\"; \\"\\"; \\"The Patty Duke Show\\"; \\"87th Precinct\\"; \\"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\\"; \\" The Waltons\\"; \\"Hawaii Five-O\\", \\"Quincy, M.E.\\"; \\"The Partridge Family\\"; \\"Bonanza\\"; \\"\\"; \\"Leave It to Beaver\\"; \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\\"; \\"Love, American Style\\"; \\"Get Smart\\"; \\"Lawman\\"; \\"Combat!\\"; \\"The Wild Wild West\\"; and in later years, \\"\\", \\"Medium\\", \\"My Name is Earl\\", and \\"True Blood\\". - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Eric Braeden (born Hans-Jörg Gudegast; April 3, 1941) is a German film and television actor, known for his roles as Victor Newman on the soap opera \\"The Young and the Restless\\", as Hans Dietrich in the 1960s TV series \\"The Rat Patrol\\", Dr. Charles Forbin in \\"\\", and as John Jacob Astor IV in the 1997 film \\"Titanic\\". He won a Daytime Emmy Award in 1998 for Lead Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Victor Newman. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - The Patty Duke Show is an American sitcom that ran on ABC from September 18, 1963 to April 27, 1966, with reruns airing through August 31.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing. It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“.

Roman Republic Slavery and slaves were part of the social order; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. However, Rome did not have a law enforcement arm. All actions were treated as \\"torts,\\" which were brought by an accuser who was forced to prove the entire case himself.

By identifying the common theme among these tattoo designs, it becomes easier to determine which font could best fit the user's preference. Moreover, it establishes the context in which the desired font is typically used, allowing for more targeted suggestions. 3. \\"Want\\": This word points to the user's personal desire or intention in getting a particular font.

Jan Brewer vetoed a bill Wednesday that would have allowed businesses that asserted their religious beliefs the right to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. The controversial measure faced a surge of opposition in recent days from large corporations and athletic organizations, including Delta Air Lines, the Super Bowl host committee and Major League Baseball. Fiercely divided supporters and opponents of the bill ramped up pressure on Brewer after the state's Republican-led Legislature approved it last week. On Wednesday, the governor said she made the decision she knew was right for Arizona. \\"I call them as I see them, despite the cheers or the boos from the crowd,\\" Brewer said, criticizing what she described as a \\"broadly worded\\" bill that \\"could result in unintended and negative consequences.\\" Brewer said she'd weighed the arguments on both sides before vetoing the measure, which is known as SB 1062. \\"To the supporters of the legislation, I want you to know that I understand that long-held norms about marriage and family are being challenged as never before. Our society is undergoing many dramatic changes,\\" she said. \\"However, I sincerely believe that Senate Bill 1062 has the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve. It could divide Arizona in ways we cannot even imagine and no one would ever want. \\"Religious liberty is a core American and Arizona value.

Banners urging Brewer to veto the bill were quickly swapped for signs praising her decision. \\"Thank you Governor Brewer,\\" they said. \\"Arizona is open for business to everyone!\\" Supporters, critics react to veto Brewer's veto drew swift praise from gay rights advocates.

Demion Clinco, the only openly gay member of Arizona's House of Representatives, said he hoped the governor's decision would start a new chapter after what he called a setback for the state's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. \\"In her vetoing the bill, I really feel like there's a possible hope for reconciliation within our state, and we can move forward,\\" he told CNN's AC360. Bill sparked heated debate Brewer returned home on Tuesday from a weekend in Washington with her state roiling over a values clash between arch conservatives and gay rights advocates. The state battle has national implications, as the issues it deals with play out in different ways in courts, state legislatures and on Main Street across the country. The Arizona measure was particularly pointed and had vocal supporters behind it. They contended it was their legal right to oppose what they see as a gay-rights agenda nationally, and argued the bill allowed for religious freedom. Opponents said the measure encouraged discrimination against gays and lesbians. In addition to gay rights organizations, many businesses sharply criticized the measure, saying it would be bad for Arizona's economy and could lead to discrimination lawsuits, boycotts and other disruptions. Economic concerns Large businesses including Apple, American Airlines, AT&T and Intel voiced opposition to the measure, and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee expressed concerns. The bill also drew fire from some Republican lawmakers with generally social conservative beliefs. Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake publicly urged Brewer to veto the measure, citing worries about the economic impact on the state's businesses.

Former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney recently tweeted that a veto of the bill was the right course. Vocal supporters, opponents Supporters of the bill were just as vocal. They say federal courts have increasingly pushed a pro-gay rights agenda. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said on his show that Brewer was \\"being bullied by the homosexual lobby in Arizona and elsewhere.\\" Supporters said they saw, in the opposition, a double standard in how the rights of gays and lesbians are supported versus those who have conservative religious views. \\"I think what we need to do is respect both sides.

Jan Brewer on Wednesday vetoed a Republican bill that set off a national debate over gay rights, religion and discrimination and subjected Arizona to blistering criticism from major corporations and political leaders from both parties. FILE-Cathi Herrod, president of the Center For Arizona Policy, speaks during an Arizona state House of Representatives hearing at the Arizona Capitol, in Phoenix, in this June 10, 2013. Arizona's Republican... (Associated Press) FILE - In this Jan. 13, 2014 file photo, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer speaks during her State of the State address at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix. The Republican governor faced intensifying pressure Tuesday... (Associated Press) Loud cheers erupted outside the Capitol building immediately after Brewer made her announcement. \\"My agenda is to sign into law legislation that advances Arizona,\\" Brewer said at a news conference. \\"I call them like I seem them despite the tears or the boos from the crowd. After weighing all the arguments, I have vetoed Senate Bill 1062 moments ago.\\" The governor said she gave the legislation careful deliberation in talking to her lawyers, citizens and lawmakers on both sides of the debate. But Brewer said the bill \\"could divide Arizona in ways we could not even imagine and no one would ever want.\\" The bill was broadly worded and could result in unintended negative consequences, she added. The bill backed by Republicans in the Legislature was designed to give added protection from lawsuits to people who assert their religious beliefs in refusing service to gays. But opponents called it an open attack on gays that invited discrimination. The bill thrust Arizona into the national spotlight last week after both chambers of the state legislature approved it. As the days passed, more and more groups, politicians and average citizens weighed in against Senate Bill 1062. Many took to social media to criticize the bill, calling it an attack on gay and lesbian rights. Prominent Phoenix business groups said it would be another black eye for the state that saw a national backlash over its 2010 immigration-crackdown law, SB1070, and warned that businesses looking to expand into the state may not do so if bill became law. Companies such as Apple Inc. and American Airlines and politicians including GOP Sen. John McCain and former Republican presidential nominee were among those who urged Brewer to veto the legislation. Brewer was under intense pressure to veto the bill, including from three Republicans who had voted for the bill last week. They said in a letter to Brewer that while the intent of their vote \\"was to create a shield for all citizens' religious liberties, the bill has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance.\\" SB 1062 allows people to claim their religious beliefs as a defense against claims of discrimination. Backers cite a New Mexico Supreme Court decision that allowed a gay couple to sue a photographer who refused to document their wedding, even though the law that allowed that suit doesn't exist in Arizona. Republican Sen. Steve Yarbrough called his proposal a First Amendment issue during a Senate debate. \\"This bill is not about allowing discrimination,\\" Yarbrough said. \\"This bill is about preventing discrimination against people who are clearly living out their faith.\\" Democrats said it was a veiled attempt to legally discriminate against gay people and could allow people to break nearly any law and cite religious freedom as a defense. \\"The heart of this bill would allow for discrimination versus gays and lesbians,\\" said Sen. Steve Gallardo, D-Phoenix. \\"You can't argue the fact that bill will invite discrimination. That's the point of this bill. It is.\\" The bill is similar to a proposal last year brought by Yarbrough but vetoed by Brewer, a Republican. That legislation also would have allowed people or religious groups to sue if they believed they might be subject to a government regulation that infringed on their religious rights. Yarbrough stripped that provision from the bill in the hopes Brewer will embrace the new version. Civil-liberties and secular groups countered that Yarbrough and the Center for Arizona Policy, a powerful social conservative group that backs anti-abortion and conservative Christian legislation in the state and is opposed to gay marriage, had sought to minimize concerns that last year's bill had far-reaching and hidden implications. Yarbrough called those worries \\"unrealistic and unsupported hypotheticals\\" and said criminal laws will continue to be prosecuted by the courts. The Center for Arizona Policy argues the law is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law. \\"We see a growing hostility toward religion,\\" said Josh Kredit, legal counsel for the group. Similar religious-protection legislation has been introduced in Ohio, Mississippi, Idaho, South Dakota, Tennessee and Oklahoma, but Arizona's plan is the only one that has been passed by a state legislature. The efforts are stalled in Idaho, Ohio and Kansas. The push in Arizona comes as an increasing number of conservative states grapple with ways to counter the growing legality of gay marriage. Arizona's voters approved a ban on gay marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008. It is one of 29 states with such constitutional prohibitions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Federal judges have recently struck down those bans in Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia, but those decisions are under appeal. ___ Associated Press reporter Brady McCombs in Salt Lake City and Jesse Holland in Washington contributed. ___ Follow Bob Christie at http://twitter.com/APChristie ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The Arizona Governor, Jan Brewer, decided to say no to a bill that would have allowed businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian customers if the businesses had religious reasons.

The once-affluent businessman had lost everything due to a series of bad investments and some unfortunate personal circumstances. He had moved to London several years ago, leaving his homeland behind, hoping to find reprieve from the shadows that hunted him. But the shadows never seemed to leave him. His brother, Balwinder, still lived in Punjab. He patiently awaited Jaswinder's return, knowing that someday the two brothers would have to face their past and work together to rebuild their lives. Balwinder had never stopped believing that Jaswinder would come back and they would make their family whole again. During these tumultuous times, he had managed to keep the family's hope afloat while they touched the lowest point in their lives. It was a typical cloudy day in London when an unemployed good-for-nothing man received a letter from the Punjab government about an opportunity to buy property in Punjab. The man, Jassi Randhawa, had recently found himself jobless after a string of ill-fated career choices. He was unsure of what to do next and his life seemed to be at a dead-end. In all the unpredictability of such times, this letter was like a beam of hope for Jassi. He knew that he couldn't waste much time pondering this chance to start anew in the land of the five rivers. He decided to gather his courage and resources, and make the journey back to his ancestral village in search of a better life. With a few possessions and undying hope, Jassi left London for Punjab in order to sell property that had been long forgotten. He found himself feeling both terrified and excited by the idea of going back to India. It had been years since he had set foot in his homeland, and the prospect of facing his past haunted him. But he knew that if he could just turn things around, he might be able to reclaim the life he once knew and perhaps be reunited with his brother. As Jaswinder's story entered its most recent chapter, a similar feeling of hope started to fill him as it did Jassi. He knew he couldn't stay in hiding forever, and he began to contemplate the idea of returning to Punjab. He pondered whether his beloved brother would still be waiting for him, and if there was any hope for rebuilding the family that had been torn apart by circumstances. In Punjab, Balwinder was trying his best to hold everything together. He yearned for the day when his brother would come back and they would be able to face the world hand in hand again. But the reality seemed bleak, and the constant force of life's challenges weighed him down. All he could do was to keep the faith and hope for a brighter tomorrow. As Jassi finally reached Punjab, he was met with a mix of emotions – happiness at being home, and sorrow at confronting a past that he had left behind. He raced to meet Balwinder and show him the letter he had received from the government. As the two brothers embraced, they realized that the weight of the past had laid between them for far too long. They decided to face their fate together and work collaboratively to revive their family's struggling fortunes. And so, the journey of the two brothers began. Jassi, once a good-for-nothing man, set off with Balwinder to explore the opportunity of selling the newly acquired property. It was a long road ahead, full of challenges and setbacks, but also with the potential of a brighter tomorrow. Together, they fought their past demons, learned from the struggles, and forged onwards, united and stronger than ever. They infused their lives with newfound purpose, determination, and a bond that couldn't be broken. The brothers knew that the path ahead was far from easy, but they were ready to face it head-on, and they did so with hope and an unbreakable spirit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Marc Marquez Alenta (born 17 February 1993) is a Spanish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and four-time MotoGP world champion. Marquez races for Honda's factory team since his MotoGP debut in 2013. Nicknamed the \\"Ant of Cervera\\", he is one of four riders to have won world championship titles in three different categories, after Mike Hailwood, Phil Read and Valentino Rossi. Marquez won the 2010 125cc World Championship, the 2012 Moto2 World Championship, and the 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017 MotoGP World Championships. Born in Cervera, Catalonia, Spain, Marquez made his championship debut on 13 April 2008 at the 125cc 2008 Portuguese Grand Prix at the age of 15 years and 56 days. He is the youngest Spanish rider to take a pole position or a podium in a motorcycle racing world championship. Marquez achieved his first podium on 22 June 2008 at the British Grand Prix. For 2009, as a factory KTM rider, at the French Grand Prix achieved his first pole position at the age of 16 years and 89 days. He also took pole for the 2010 Spanish Grand Prix but the exhaust pipe fell off on the opening lap and went under the rear wheel, causing Marquez to crash and injure his shoulder. His first win was on 6 June 2010 at Mugello. Further victories at Silverstone, Assen and Catalonia in the next three races made Marquez the youngest rider to win four successive races. His fifth win in succession at the Sachsenring was Derbi's 100th victory in Grand Prix racing, and Marquez became the first rider since Valentino Rossi in 1997 to win five successive races in 125cc racing. He was less successful in the following races, dropping to third in the standings at one point behind Nicolas Terol and Pol Espargaro after being involved in an accident with Randy Krummenacher at the first corner at the Aragon Grand Prix. Four successive wins from Motegi onwards had moved Marquez into a 17-point lead over Terol with only one round to go. At Estoril, the race was red-flagged due to rain with Marquez running second to Terol. When returning to the grid for the second race, Marquez fell on the sighting lap and had to return to the pits. With repairs, Marquez started at the back of the field having not made it out of the pit lane before it closed five minutes prior to the start. Despite this, Marquez recovered to win the race and thus extend his lead before the Valencia finale. His tenth victory of the season moved him to within one of tying the record set by Rossi in 1997. He would fall short of tying it as he was fourth at the final race in Valencia to become the second-youngest World Champion after Loris Capirossi.","completion":"This text is about Marc Marquez Alenta, a Spanish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and four-time MotoGP world champion.

Let's subtract 85 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side. 17*y + 85 - 85 = 0 - 85 This simplifies to: 17*y = -85 Step 4: Solve for y Finally, we will divide both sides of the equation by 17 to solve for y. 17*y / 17 = -85 / 17 This simplifies to: y = -5 So, the solution to the equation -33*y + 50*y + 117 - 32 = 0 is y = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who was missing when everyone woke up? Movie title: Shock Waves Movie plot: The film opens as Rose (Brooke Adams) is found drifting alone in a small rowboat. Two fishermen find the dinghy and pull her onto their boat, barely alive and in a horrible state. Her voiceover indicates she had been rescued from some terrifying experience. The film's events are flashbacks.Rose is seen previously as part of a small group of tourists aboard a small commercial pleasure boat. The Captain (John Carradine) seems to be having trouble with the boat. His mate, Chuck (Fred Buch), seems to share a mutual attraction with Rose. Also on board are Dobbs (Don Stout), who is the boat's cook; Keith (Luke Halpin), another tourist; and a bickering married couple named Norman (Jack Davidson) and Beverly (D.J. Sidney).After some trouble with the engine, the Captain and Chuck are faced with the fact that their navigation system is going haywire after they encounter a strange orange haze. The others sense that something is wrong and that they may be lost at sea. Norman in particular becomes very whiny about it, insulting the Captain and being generally abrasive to everyone.

Question: If acavern is formed by carbon dioxide is in groundwater seeping through rock and dissolving limestone, then what forms caverns by seeping through rock and dissolving limestone? Answer choices: - pure oxygen - Something with a head, thorax, and abdomen - basic building blocks of life - carbon dioxide in groundwater - magma in groundwater - oxygen in groundwater - At the peak of a mountain - underground systems Answer:","completion":"Carbon dioxide in groundwater forms caverns by seeping through rock and dissolving limestone. To understand this process, we need to explore the factors involved in cavern formation, the properties of the substances included, and the conditions under which this phenomenon occurs. Caverns are natural underground spaces, typically found in limestone rock formations, that can have various sizes and shapes depending upon the geological processes that led to their formation. Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock mainly composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) derived from the skeletal fragments of marine organisms like coral and foraminifera. This rock is highly susceptible to chemical weathering and dissolving by water that has a certain amount of acidity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) plays a crucial role in increasing the acidity of groundwater. The process begins with rainwater absorbing carbon dioxide from the air as it falls to the earth's surface, forming a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3). As this slightly acidic water seeps into the ground, it can percolate through soil and rocks, absorbing even more carbon dioxide from decaying organic materials and the surrounding geology. When the acidic groundwater reaches limestone layers, the carbonic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate in the limestone, producing calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2). This reaction results in the dissolution of the limestone, an effect that can lead to the gradual expansion of existing fractures and the creation of new voids within the rock. Over time, these voids can enlarge and merge to form a complex network of interconnected chambers – or caverns. Although there are other methods for the formation of caves and caverns – such as through the action of lava flows or erosion caused by water – the dissolution of limestone by carbon dioxide in groundwater is the most common mechanism for the creation of vast cavern systems, particularly in areas with extensive limestone deposits. Now let's review the other answer choices you provided: 1. Pure oxygen: Oxygen itself doesn't have the necessary properties to form caverns by dissolving limestone. 2. Something with a head, thorax, and abdomen: This choice likely refers to an organism, like an insect, which doesn't have any direct role in the formation of caverns. 3. Basic building blocks of life: While organic material does have a role in the release of carbon dioxide into the soil, it is the carbon dioxide in groundwater that's responsible for forming caverns. 4. Magma in groundwater: Although magma can form caves through volcanic processes, it isn't directly related to the dissolution of limestone through groundwater. 5. Oxygen in groundwater: Similar to \\"pure oxygen,\\" dissolved oxygen in groundwater is not responsible for dissolving limestone. 6. At the peak of a mountain: This choice refers to a location and therefore doesn't have any direct relevance to the process of cavern formation. 7. Underground systems: This term is too general to describe the specific process of forming caverns through groundwater interacting with limestone. In conclusion, the most accurate answer to the question of what forms caverns by seeping through rock and dissolving limestone is carbon dioxide in groundwater. It is the interaction between carbon dioxide, water, and limestone that leads to the dissolution process responsible for the formation of extensive cavern systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve 0 = 8*b + 13 - 37 for b. What is the solution?","completion":"Alright, little buddy, let's solve the math problem step by step! We have the equation: 0 = 8 * b + 13 - 37 First, we can simplify the equation by combining the numbers 13 and -37. What's 13 minus 37? That's right, it's -24! So our equation now looks like this: 0 = 8 * b - 24 Now we need to find the value of \\"b\\". To do that, we need to move -24 to the other side of the \\"=\\" sign. To move -24, we will add 24 to both sides. So we get: 24 = 8 * b Now we want to know how many times 8 is in 24. So we will divide 24 by 8. What's 24 divided by 8? Yes, it's 3! So the value of \\"b\\" is 3. So the solution is b = 3! Great job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Isolate the variable w by moving all w-related terms to one side of the equation. Step-by-step explanation: Step 1: Write down the equation 80*w = 84*w + 12 Step 2: Isolate the variable w To do this, I'll subtract 80*w from both sides to have all the w terms on one side of the equation: 80*w - 80*w = 84*w - 80*w + 12 This simplifies to: 0 = 4*w + 12 Now, I need to isolate w completely. I will do this by moving the constant term (12) to the other side of the equation: -12 = 4*w Finally, I will divide both sides by 4 to find the value of w: -12 / 4 = w -3 = w So the solution to the equation 80*w = 84*w + 12 is w = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Since 2002 economic growth has slowed, with GDP growth of 1.5% in 2008. Tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices of fuel and food in 2008, with the level of inflation peaking at 13.4%. The International Monetary Fund 2010 Report on Tuvalu estimates that Tuvalu experienced zero growth in its 2010 GDP, after the economy contracted by about 2% in 2009. On 5 August 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Tuvalu, and assessed the economy of Tuvalu: \\"A slow recovery is underway in Tuvalu, but there are important risks. GDP grew in 2011 for the first time since the global financial crisis, led by the private retail sector and education spending. We expect growth to rise slowly\\". The IMF 2014 Country Report noted that real GDP growth in Tuvalu had been volatile averaging only 1 percent in the past decade.

Make this lower case","completion":"\\"but foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.\\" While this sentence has been converted to lower case, as per your request, it is important to understand the context and meaning of the text. The original sentence is a verse from the Bible, specifically 2 Timothy 2:23, which is part of the New Testament. In this verse, the Apostle Paul is imparting wisdom and guidance to Timothy, a young leader in the early Christian Church. The verse can be interpreted in different ways, but the main essence is to avoid getting into unnecessary conflicts and disputes by not indulging in pointless or trivial arguments. By completely understanding the fact that such arguments often lead to discord and division, it is advised to steer clear of them. In this context, the term \\"foolish and unlearned questions\\" refers to questions or debates that do not contribute to one's spiritual growth or development. These types of questions might be raised to provoke controversy or to distract people from the more important matters at hand. By avoiding these quarrels and focusing on what truly matters, a person can maintain a sense of unity and harmony within their community. Moreover, this piece of advice is not only relevant for religious or spiritual contexts but can be applied to other aspects of life as well. People often find themselves entangled in unproductive arguments or discussions that only serve to create animosity and negative emotions without any meaningful resolution. To exemplify this, consider the never-ending debates on various online platforms that usually lead nowhere – just people arguing for the sake of arguing. Instead, it is advisable to spend our time and energy on meaningful discussions and personal growth rather than on petty conflicts that only generate negativity and hostility. In conclusion, the verse \\"but foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes\\" is an important reminder for all of us to be mindful of our conversations and interactions with others. By avoiding arguments that lead to conflicts and focusing on constructive conversations, we can make a positive impact on our own lives and the lives of those around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Manchester United, in their bid to strengthen the team after underwhelming performances, have dug deep into their pockets during the summer transfer window. They've signed high profile players such as Falcao, Angel di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marco Rojo, adding depth to the squad. Yet, amidst this volley of big-ticket procurements, it comes as a surprise that they let go of a promising player like Welbeck at a price that seems meagre in comparison. Welbeck, a product of United's academy, showed significant promise and was widely regarded as a future star. An English striker who knew the Premier League well, his sale to a rival club like Arsenal left many, including Neville, perplexed. Gary Neville's bafflement rings louder when considering his close working relationship with Welbeck during their time together at the England camp. He had seen Welbeck's growth closely and believed in his potential to contribute significantly to United, making the transfer decision even more puzzling. 'I worked with Danny Welbeck last week [with England],' Neville shared. 'It's odd.' In his critique, Gary Neville suggests that Manchester United's transfer scheme appears to lack consistency. He believes that the club, known for its historically strategic planning and player development, has somehow deviated from that path. From his viewpoint, the Welbeck sale reflects a lack of forethought, thus casting a shadow on the club's ostensible major signings' glamour. It remains to be seen how the club's extravagant ventures will pay off, and whether Welbeck's departure will indeed turn out to be the tactical misstep Neville anticipates. Regardless, Gary Neville's candid critique offers a potent reminder that big names don't necessarily correspond with strategic roster building and that Manchester United must be careful in maintaining its prestigious legacy. As the football world continues to turn, eyes will undoubtedly remain on Old Trafford, watching as this perceived deviation from norm unravels on the pitch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mr Jones said continuing to strengthen relations between Westminster and Cardiff Bay would benefit the people of Wales. He said: \\"Wales needs its two governments to work together.\\" Mr Jones said that although 2012 was \\"a golden year for Great Britain\\" it also \\"underlined that we are not immune to the uncertainties faced in the global market\\". He said the commitment to electrify the rail network from Cardiff to Swansea and the south Wales valleys meant Wales was benefiting directly or indirectly from almost £2bn modernisation, the \\"most significant infrastructure announcement for Wales for decades\\". The agreement in principle for the Welsh government to have access to capital borrowing powers was a \\"major development,\\" he added. The extra £227m in capital funding the Chancellor, George Osborne, announced in his autumn statement means the Welsh government has an extra £674m during the current spending review period, he said.

She _ less than a month before Mother's Day in the year 2000. She had been ill for almost two years, and I didn't cry when she died, or at her funeral, but on that first Mother's Day without her. On that day, I realized that this person I loved and depended on was gone forever. She still lives in family memories, in the thoughts of her friends and co-workers, in the values she had instilled in her children, and in the lovely flower gardens that she had so carefully tended. She loved her gladioli and irises. Each fall she would dig the bulbs out of the soil and carefully wrap them in paper. The bulbs would be stored until the following spring when they would be replanted. It seemed like a lot of effort to me, but each year her flower garden was more glorious than the year before. She put the same hard work into caring for her family, instilling in her children a sense of justice and fair play, compassion, and strong moral values so that we blossomed. Share anecdotes about your mother's life at your Mother's Day party. Too often, we avoid speaking of those loved ones who have passed away, fearful that we will unearth sad feelings. It doesn't have to be that way. Sharing fond memories and stories of the life we shared with her can be a healing process that binds the family together.

Krishnan Nair (25 July 1939 - 16 November 1980), better known by his stage name Jayan, was an Indian film actor, naval officer, stunt performer and cultural icon of the 1970s. He starred in over 120 Malayalam films. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his macho image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing stunts of a dangerous nature on his own. On 16 November 1980, Jayan was killed in an accident on the set of the movie Kolilakkam (English: Shockwave). The climactic scene of the movie was being filmed in Sholavaram, near Madras, Tamil Nadu. Jayan always performed his own stunts, and for this movie he was performing a particularly dangerous stunt that involved him boarding an airborne helicopter from a moving motorbike. The shot was accepted by the director in the first take; altogether three shots were filmed. According to the film's production executive, Jayan insisted on yet another re-take as he was not satisfied with its perfection. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the landing skids, and he later succumbed to his injuries. After his death was confirmed, a slide was added during the theatre show of his movie Deepam, which was running in packed houses, informing his death to the viewers who witnessed it with absolute shock and disbelief. A large number of his fans burst into tears and ran out of the buildings, while many continued to watch the movie, refusing to believe it and taking it for an ingenious promotion for some upcoming project. Jayan's body was taken to Trivandrum via aeroplane and later it was taken to his home in Quilon, where he was cremated. Thousands paid homage to the late actor, and the police had to take huge measures to deal with the crowds. His mother Bharathiyamma became bedridden after this incident, and she too died two years later. Some conspiracy theories emerged regarding the circumstances of his death, primarily because the pilot and his co-star Balan K. Nair, who was in the helicopter, survived with minor or no injuries. Nevertheless, it has been confirmed as a genuine accident.

Question: Where is known for powerful storms from the ocean? Options: - rain - weather report - tropics - summer - america Explain why a human would choose \\"tropics\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Tropics. A human would choose \\"tropics\\" to answer the question above because it refers to a specific geographical area known for its powerful storms that originate from the ocean. In contrast, the other options provided, such as rain, weather report, summer, and America, do not convey the same level of specificity or relevance to the context of the question. The tropics are the area located between the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere and the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere. This region experiences high temperatures, intense sunlight, and heavy rainfall, which leads to the development of tropical weather systems and powerful oceanic storms. There are several reasons why the tropics are known for powerful storms from the ocean: 1. Warm ocean waters: In the tropics, the ocean surface temperatures are high, typically ranging from 80°F to 90°F (26°C to 32°C), particularly during the warmest months of the year. Warm ocean waters provide the fuel necessary for the development and intensification of tropical storms and hurricanes. The heat and moisture from the warm waters cause the air to rise, forming storm clouds and creating conditions that can result in powerful storms. 2. Atmospheric conditions: The movement of air in and around the tropics plays a significant role in the formation of storms. The atmospheric circulation is characterized by the convergence of trade winds near the equator, which generates upward motion of the warm, moist air, creating thunderstorms and intense rainfall. Additionally, the presence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and easterly waves (elongated regions of low pressure) can also contribute to storm development in the tropics. 3. Limited wind shear: The tropics have relatively low vertical wind shear during parts of the year, which allows storms to develop without being disrupted by strong upper-level winds. Wind shear is the change in wind speed and direction with altitude, and tropical storms need a low-shear environment to grow and strengthen. 4. Coriolis effect: The Coriolis effect, caused by Earth's rotation, is responsible for the rotation of tropical storms and hurricanes around their low-pressure centers. This rotation is vital for the development and maintenance of such powerful storms. In the tropics, the Coriolis effect is stronger than near the equator, which is conducive to the formation and intensification of storms. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"tropics\\" to answer the question about powerful storms from the ocean because the tropics are a unique geographical area characterized by warm ocean waters, specific atmospheric conditions, limited wind shear, and a strong Coriolis effect. All these factors together create the perfect environment for powerful oceanic storms, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, to form and thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: the term that describes a function that is symmetric about the y-axis is?","completion":"The term that describes a function that is symmetric about the y-axis is \\"even function.\\" An even function is a mathematical function that satisfies the equation f(-x) = f(x) for all values of x within the function's domain. In simpler terms, an even function remains unchanged when we replace x with -x. Symmetry about the y-axis means that the function's graph appears identical on both sides of the y-axis when reflected across it. In other words, for an even function, the portion of the graph on the left side of the y-axis is a mirror image of the portion on the right side. This bilateral symmetry makes even functions easy to recognize, as their visual appearance is balanced and harmonious around the y-axis. The name \\"even function\\" comes from the fact that all even powers of x (x^2, x^4, x^6, etc.) are even functions, though not all even functions exclusively consist of even powers. Some common examples of even functions include the quadratic function f(x) = x^2, the cosine function f(x) = cos(x), and the absolute value function f(x) = |x|. It is important to note that a function can be neither even nor odd, meaning it does not exhibit symmetry about the y-axis (even function) or the origin (odd function). In such cases, the function will not satisfy the conditions for either even or odd functions. An example of a function that is neither even nor odd is f(x) = x^3 + x + 1. In conclusion, the term that describes a function that is symmetric about the y-axis is \\"even function.\\" These functions satisfy the equation f(-x) = f(x), and their graphs visually exhibit symmetry on both sides of the y-axis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Act 1: The film starts with a panoramic view of the quaint, peaceful town of Elmswood, with an ominous air that foreshadows the events to come. The main character, Sarah Collins, is a successful journalist in her late twenties, who returns to her hometown in search of a breaking story, only to find herself unraveling the haunting and twisted past of her favorite teacher from high school, Mr. Gribble. While hanging out with her childhood friends at a local bar, they reminisce about their high school days and talk about where their lives have taken them. The topic of Mr. Gribble, their favorite teacher, and mentor shifts the conversation to a more serious tone. They recall how he had mysteriously vanished from the town years ago, leaving behind only vague rumors of his past. Act 2: Intrigued by Mr. Gribble's enigma and desperate for an exclusive story, Sarah decides to investigate. As she starts digging deeper through police records and newspaper archives, she discovers that the seemingly harmless teacher had been involved in a string of unsolved cases that have troubled the town for years. The investigation takes a turn when Sarah and her friends stumble upon a hidden room in Mr. Gribble's old house, where they find an old journal alongside newspaper clippings of missing person cases - all of them former students who had mysteriously disappeared. The authorities, however, never considered Mr. Gribble a viable suspect due to his exemplary record and reputation in town. Act 3: As the group delves further into the journal, they discover that Mr. Gribble was once a part of a secret society, devoted to an ancient and sinister cult. The cult's rituals involved the kidnapping and sacrifice of unsuspecting victims in exchange for immortality.

Answer the following question: - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process that leads to the series of consequences mentioned is the acidification of soil. This occurs when acidic substances, such as acid rain or other pollutants, are introduced to the environment and infiltrate the soil. Acid rain, for instance, is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from industrial processes and fossil fuel combustion. These emissions react with water vapor and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which then fall to the ground as acid rain. When soil becomes acidified, its pH level decreases, which affects its overall structure, composition, and biological activity. An acidic environment causes aluminum, a naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, to become more soluble and bioavailable. As a result, plants growing in acidic soil will absorb higher amounts of aluminum, which can be toxic to them, impairing their growth and reproductive capabilities. This is the first step in the process that leads to the negative cascade of events in the ecosystem. As the water carrying dissolved aluminum runs off from the soil, it enters lakes, streams, and other bodies of water, eventually accumulating in aquatic environments. Aquatic organisms, such as fish, are exposed to the increased levels of aluminum, which can be toxic and result in fish kills or the death of their eggs. The declining fish population, in turn, has a domino effect on the food web, disrupting the balance of the ecosystem. Amphibians, such as frogs, are also highly sensitive to changes in their environment, including exposure to aluminum. Additionally, in an acidic environment, many aquatic plant species may struggle to survive, further impacting the ecosystem. The loss of plants and amphibians can lead to a decrease in food sources for insects and other wildlife, which can then experience population declines. As more organisms are affected, the ecosystem becomes increasingly imbalanced and vulnerable. This can lead to drastic changes in the biodiversity and overall health of the ecosystem, making it less resilient to future environmental stressors. In order to mitigate these negative effects, it is crucial to address the root cause of the issue: the release of pollutants that lead to soil acidification and the associated chain of consequences. Efforts to reduce emissions, promote sustainable agricultural practices, and implement conservation and restoration initiatives are essential to preserving the health and balance of ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: complain to their boss about the smell, look up what day trash collection is, wash their hands A:","completion":"Before Tracy took the garbage out on the day of trash collection as a favor to their boss, there could have been a few tasks they needed to complete beforehand depending on the specific circumstances. However, based on the three possible answers provided: complain to their boss about the smell, look up what day trash collection is, wash their hands, the action that seems most likely and necessary is \\"look up what day trash collection is.\\" This is because Tracy would need to know when exactly the trash collection day was to ensure they took out the garbage on the correct day. Without this information, Tracy might miss the collection, leading to the trash continuing to stink and possibly causing more serious sanitation issues. Complaining to their boss about the smell doesn't seem like a necessary action before taking out the trash, it might be a likely reaction to encountering a foul-smelling trash bin but it doesn’t have a direct impact on the process of taking the trash out. It seems more like something Tracy might do after the task was done, especially considering they've already decided to act favorably and take out the trash on behalf of their boss. Washing their hands is an imperative hygiene process but it would typically be done after dealing with garbage to remove germs and dirt acquired from handling waste, not prior to it.

After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by one of his own rocket-propelled grenades. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings, and an electromagnet is grafted into his chest by fellow captive Yinsen to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word. Stark and Yinsen quietly build a powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings attack the workshop when they discover their hostages' intentions. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then in anger burns the Ten Rings weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest.

A perennial loser for years, the team's manager Joe McGrath (Strother Martin) has resorted to extreme cost-cutting techniques and embarrassing promotional antics to keep local interest alive. Dunlop, while not particularly talented as either a player or coach, is a skilled con man, and regularly manipulates the team to his own advantage. During a hopeless season, the Chiefs pick up the Hanson Brothers, bespectacled violent goons with childlike mentalities, complete with toys in their luggage. Horrified at being given players who seem stupid, immature, and unreliable, Dunlop initially chooses not to play them. When it is announced that the local mill will be closing and 10,000 workers will be unemployed, Dunlop grows concerned about the team's future. He makes several attempts to learn the identity of the team's anonymous owner (a running gag throughout the film), but is deftly deflected by McGrath each time. When McGrath accompanies them on an away game, top scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) overhears him attempting to get a job with another team. After Braden relays this information to his teammates, Dunlop confronts McGrath, who confirms that the Chiefs will fold at the end of the season. Determined to save the team at all costs, Dunlop starts provoking fights at games to secure goals and the Chiefs start to win games. In a moment of desperation, he lets the Hansons play and discovers that their aggressive fighting style enthralls the fans. He begins retooling the team as a goon squad in the Hansons' image and attendance quickly increases. Capitalizing on this growing interest, he plants a false story with eccentric sports news writer Dickie Dunn (M.

What is the sentiment of this tweet?","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"Off out to doctors appointment.\\" is neutral with a slight leaning towards negative. Before delving into the sentiment analysis, it is important to break down the given text and understand its components. The tweet is a brief statement regarding a person's plans to go to a doctor's appointment. The phrase \\"off out\\" suggests that the person is about to leave or is on their way out for the appointment. There isn't any explicit expression of emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, or excitement in this sentence. However, considering the context of a doctor's appointment, it can be noted that these appointments are often associated with health concerns, physical discomfort, or general medical check-ups. As such, there might be an implied negative tone to the sentiment, as the individual might be going to the doctor to address an issue. However, this negativity is subtle and not explicitly expressed in the tweet. Furthermore, a doctor's appointment can also be seen as a responsible action, where an individual is taking care of their health and well-being. In this regards, the sentiment may lean a little towards positive, as the individual is being proactive about their health and attending to potential concerns. Taking these factors into account, the overall sentiment of the tweet is best described as neutral – neither strongly positive nor strongly negative – with a subtle inclination towards a negative sentiment. This is because of the implied health concerns and the general perception that doctor's appointments are associated with potential medical issues, even though the tweet itself does not provide specifics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Why isn't this really a problem?\\" Context: \\"Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a \\"time slice\\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.\\" Answer:","completion":"The statement in the context suggests that multitasking is not really a problem for computers, primarily because most programs spend a significant amount of time waiting for slow input/output (I/O) devices to complete their tasks. This section will delve deeper into understanding why multitasking is not a significant issue for computers and explore the factors that contribute to efficient multitasking in modern computing systems. There are several reasons why multitasking isn't a major problem for computers: 1. Efficient task scheduling: Modern operating systems are designed with advanced scheduling algorithms that efficiently manage the available computer resources, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. These algorithms allocate time slices or periods for each program to execute while ensuring that system performance is not compromised. In this way, the operating system can maintain an acceptable level of responsiveness and performance, even when several programs are running simultaneously. 2. Time-sharing and prioritization: Time-sharing is a technique employed by operating systems to allocate the CPU's processing power among multiple programs. This is achieved by assigning priorities to programs and allowing higher-priority programs to execute ahead of lower-priority ones. As a result, more important tasks receive prompt attention, while less critical tasks are often deferred until the system is less busy. 3. Preemptive multitasking: Modern operating systems use preemptive multitasking, which enables them to switch between programs at regular intervals and spread out the CPU's processing power evenly across all running programs. This approach ensures that no single program hogs the CPU for an extended period and that all programs have equal opportunities to execute. 4. Waiting events and freeing up resources: The context explains that most programs spend a considerable amount of time waiting for user interaction or I/O devices to complete their tasks. When a program is waiting for an event, such as a mouse click or a keyboard press, it will not consume a time slice. This inactivity period allows other programs to execute and prevents the waiting program from hogging the CPU unnecessarily. 5. Multi-core processors: Modern computer systems often feature multi-core processors, which contain multiple processing units (cores) on a single chip. These processors are designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, further alleviating the issue of slow performance due to multitasking. 6. Hardware advancements: Technological advancements in hardware components, such as faster CPUs, larger memory capacities, and quicker storage devices, contribute to improved performance in multitasking scenarios. As computers continue to evolve, they become more efficient at managing multiple tasks at once without compromising their performance or responsiveness. In conclusion, although multitasking may seem like it would slow down a computer, several factors such as efficient scheduling algorithms, time-sharing, preemptive multitasking, waiting events, multi-core processors, and improvements in hardware technologies work collectively to mitigate performance loss. As a result, computers can effectively run several programs simultaneously without any significant loss in speed or responsiveness, making multitasking not a significant problem for modern computer systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not enough water and overwatering can cause the leaves to turn yellow and drop from the plant. If the leaves begin to turn yellow, water the plant less often if the soil is still wet or more often if the soil appears dry between waterings. This way, any water splashed on the leaves will be dry before evening. Cold tap water will chill your plant's roots and stress your plants, causing it to drop its leaves. Wet leaves and cooler nighttime temperatures also provide a breeding ground for leaf spot. If your plant develops brown or black spots on its leaves, snip the damaged leaves off at the base and throw them away. Use water-soluble houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength. The half-strength dilution rate for most water-soluble fertilizers is about ½ teaspoon per gallon of water but it could be slightly higher or lower. Check the label for the manufacturer's recommended dilution rate and reduce the amount by half. Aim for a balanced houseplant fertilizer with a ratio of 8-8-8 or 10-10-10. Too little fertilizer will cause the prayer plant to grow slowly or not at all. Too much fertilizer will burn the roots and cause the leaves to develop dry brown edges. When given the correct amount of fertilizer, prayer plants will have healthy green stems and leaves and grow vigorously. Use a peat-based potting mix with a pH of 5.5 to 6.0 or mix two parts sphagnum peat moss, one part loamy soil, and one part perlite or coarse sand together. Stir all of the ingredients together until they are thoroughly mixed. Sphagnum peat moss, loamy soil, perlite, and coarse sand can be purchased at local garden centers. Purchase only clean, pre-packaged materials that have been commercially processed and are free of insects and weed seeds. When the container for the plant becomes full of roots, the potting mix dries out very quickly, causing the prayer plant to grow very slowly. This condition is called pot-bound. The new container for your plant should be only 1 to 2 inches wider than the old one. Put 1 inch of potting mix in the bottom of the new container, remove the prayer plant from the old container, place it in the new container and finish filling it with the potting mix. Once it's been repotted, water it generously to settle the soil around the roots. You can divide your prayer plant into several smaller plants by gently shaking the soil off the roots and working them apart. Each new plant should have a good mass of roots and several stems. Pot these new smaller plants up separately in small, shallow pots. Use sharp scissors or hand pruners to snip a few of the stems back by a few inches. Make the cuts just above a leaf. New stems and leaves will grow from the growth nodes located below the cut where the remaining leaf is growing, so you will have lots of prayer plants to enjoy in your home.","completion":"The article provides detailed instructions for maintaining a healthy prayer plant, emphasizing the importance of keeping the soil moist but not overwatered, using chilled tap water and half-strength water-soluble fertilizer, trimming damaged foliage, and re-potting the plant in a peat-based potting mix with a pH of 5.5 to 6.0 in a container no more than 2 inches larger than the last, with steps to divide the plant into smaller ones and details on how to encourage new leaf growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

Paragraph: In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Finnish is a Uralic language and is a member of the Finno-Ugric family, which also includes Hungarian and a few minority languages spoken in Russia. Finnish is the official language of Finland, a nation located in Northern Europe. It's spoken by the majority of the population in Finland. It is also recognized as a minority language in some parts of Sweden. The Finnish alphabet is based on the Latin script, with the addition of a few letters with diacritics. It includes 21 letters found in the ISO basic Latin Alphabet, plus the additional Finnish letters Å, Ä, and Ö. Finnish is characterized by its phonemic length and complex inflection. Both vowels and consonants can be either short or long. The length is phonemic, meaning that it changes the word's meaning, not just its pronunciation. As for inflection, Finnish has 15 noun cases, which means that the role of a noun in a sentence is mainly shown by the ending of the word. In the sentence you have quoted, \\"Arvoisa puhemies, olin myös esittänyt kysymyksen neuvostolle,\\" it seems to be a formal, possibly political context. The phrase can be translated to English as, \\"Honorable Speaker, I had also presented a question to the council.\\" Despite the challenges in its complex morphology, Finnish is a beautiful language with rich literature and a profound history.

Given the question: - You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The last step of the process is the distribution of oxygen-rich blood to the body's cells and tissues, which is crucial for their survival, growth, and proper functioning. After the oxygen has been carried by the blood to the heart, it is distributed throughout the body by the arteries. The heart's left ventricle contracts and pumps the oxygen-rich blood into the aorta – the largest and main artery in the body. The aorta branches into a network of smaller arteries that eventually divide into arterioles and even smaller vessels called capillaries. These capillaries are responsible for distributing oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells and tissues. As the oxygen-rich blood reaches the capillaries, oxygen molecules diffuse across the thin capillary walls and enter the interstitial fluid surrounding the cells. Cells then take up the oxygen molecules through their cell membranes, utilizing a process called cellular respiration to generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP acts as the primary energy currency for cells and is vital for powering various cellular activities, such as metabolism, muscle contractions, and maintaining homeostasis. As the body's cells receive the oxygen needed to perform their functions, they release carbon dioxide – a waste product generated during cellular respiration. Carbon dioxide molecules then diffuse back into the bloodstream, entering the venous blood. This blood, now called deoxygenated blood, is transported back to the heart through the network of veins, where it is ultimately pumped to the lungs for exhalation. This exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body's cells and the blood in the capillaries is referred to as internal respiration. In summary, the last step of the process after the blood carries the oxygen to the heart is the distribution of oxygen-rich blood to the body's cells and tissues through the arterial system, where it enables cellular respiration for energy production. The waste product, carbon dioxide, is then carried back to the heart through the venous system, completing the entire respiratory and circulatory process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Malala Yousafzai was transferred to a military hospital in Rawalpindi on Thursday. Doctors say her progress over the next few days will be \\"critical\\". The girl wrote a diary about suffering under the Taliban and was accused by them of \\"promoting secularism\\". Police said they had arrested four people in connection with the attack. They were among about 100 people rounded up this week, most of whom were later released on bail. The suspected mastermind of the attack remains at large. Meanwhile, Pakistani officials said they had intercepted a telephone conversation suggesting Taliban militants were planning attacks against the media over their coverage of the shooting. The Taliban had earlier said they would target Malala Yousafzai again. At the scene Here at the hospital in Rawalpindi the security is extremely tight. They do not let anyone enter the wing where Malala is, and a few hours before Prime Minister Raja Pervaz Ashraf's visit, they did not even allow the families of other patients to go in. They didn't let a woman with a bouquet for Malala get close. There are a lot of journalists outside the hospital, but the family is keeping away from the media. The doctors who are attending Malala are not picking up the phone anymore. The press conference with the prime minister was packed with journalists. Everyone was aware of the new threat the Taliban made, but no-one seemed to be afraid of it. Local officials have offered a 10m rupee (105,000; £66,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers. The shooting has prompted outrage and protests across Pakistan. On Friday, school children dedicated prayers to her recovery in morning assemblies and she was also remembered during weekly prayers at mosques across the country. Many prayer leaders condemned the attack, including the chief cleric of Pakistan's largest mosque, Shahi Masjid, in Lahore. He called the young activist an \\"ambassador of peace and knowledge'\\". Schools in the Swat Valley closed on Wednesday - the day after the shooting - in protest at the attack. Rallies have also been held in Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Multan as well as in Malala's hometown of Mingora. The attack has also drawn widespread international condemnation. 'Critical' hours Malala Yousafzai was being treated in an intensive care unit in Peshawar before doctors decided to move her to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology critical care unit in Rawalpindi. \\"Malala's condition is satisfactory, praise be to God, but the next 24 to 36 hours are critical,\\" military spokesman Maj Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa told reporters at a briefing. \\"Today is the sacred day of Friday and the entire nation is praying for her health. I pray to Allah that He bestows her with good health very soon,\\" he is quoted as saying by AFP news agency. The teenager was attacked on Tuesday as she was returning home from school in Mingora in north-western Swat. Two armed men, on foot, stopped a van packed with about a dozen schoolgirls in a congested area of the town. One of them got into the van and asked which of the girls was Malala Yousafzai before he fired three shots, hitting Malala in the head and injuring two others. Prime Minister Raja Pervaz Ashraf visited Malala Yousafzai on Friday, the latest politician to do so, and has asked other political leaders to join him in showing solidarity. Media caption Malala Yusufzai spoke to BBC Urdu in November 2011 Army chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who visited Malala in hospital in Peshawar earlier in the week, said it was time to \\"stand up to fight the propagators of such barbaric mindset and their sympathisers\\". Malala Yousafzai first gained attention aged 11, when she started writing a diary for BBC Urdu about life under the Taliban. Using the pen-name Gul Makai, she wrote about suffering caused by militants who had taken control of the Swat Valley in 2007 and ordered girls' schools to close.

In the context of healthcare provision, it is essential for caregivers to have access to their patients and their medical information in real-time when they visit the patient's location. This enables caregivers to make informed decisions, provide appropriate care, monitor the patient's condition, and adjust their treatment plans accordingly. Here are some ways through which this can be achieved: 1. Utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs): EHRs provide a comprehensive and up-to-date record of a patient's medical history, including their demographics, previous diagnoses, medications, laboratory results, and other relevant information. By integrating EHRs into home-visit workflows, caregivers can have immediate access to critical information about their patients, allowing them to make better-informed decisions during their visit. 2. Implementing Telehealth Services: Telehealth services can help bridge the gap between caregiver and patient by providing real-time, remote access to patients' medical information, as well as facilitating communication between them. This allows caregivers to evaluate their patients' condition remotely, ensuring that they have the necessary information to provide appropriate care when they arrive at the patient's location. 3. Streamlining Appointment Scheduling: Effective scheduling is crucial for making sure that patients are available when caregivers arrive at their homes. Digital tools and applications can help automate scheduling processes, send reminders to patients and caregivers, and track appointment compliance. These tools can minimize inconveniences and optimize the time spent on in-person visits. 4. Integrating Home Monitoring Devices: Remote monitoring devices and wearable technology can provide real-time insights into a patient's condition, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels. By integrating these tools into the caregiving process, caregivers can access up-to-date information about their patients' conditions and make informed decisions about their care. 5. Enhancing Patient-Caregiver Communication: Open lines of communication between patients and caregivers can help ensure that patients are available when caregivers arrive at their homes. Providing patients with multiple communication channels, such as mobile apps, websites, and phone support, makes it easier for them to get in touch with caregivers and inform them of any changes to their schedule or condition. 6. Continuous Training for Caregivers: To ensure that caregivers are equipped to handle real-time patient care, healthcare organizations should prioritize continuous training and education. This includes providing caregivers with access to the latest evidence-based research, best practices, and technologies. 7. Promoting Interprofessional Collaboration: Encouraging collaboration between healthcare providers, including physicians, nurses, and specialists, can help create a more seamless care experience for patients. Through shared electronic records, case conferences and collaborative care planning, caregivers can ensure that all relevant information is available when they visit a patient at home. By implementing these strategies and leveraging technology, healthcare providers can ensure that patients are available in real-time when their caregivers visit them, resulting in better care outcomes, improved patient satisfaction, and more efficient use of healthcare resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She knew vanilla ice cream was Lindsey's favorite. She also bought lots of gooey caramel sauce, whipped cream, and a big bowl of cherries to put on top. When she got home, Laura started putting everything together. First, she scooped out a mountain of ice cream into a huge bowl, making sure it was extra soft and creamy. Then, she drizzled the sticky caramel sauce all over the ice cream, so it looked like a sweet, golden waterfall. Laura knew Lindsey would love the taste of the caramel with the ice cream. Next, Laura sprayed a big, fluffy cloud of whipped cream on top of it all, being super careful not to get any on her face! She knew that whipped cream made the sundae taste even more delicious and fun. Finally, she added the cherries on top, one by one, making the sundae look extra pretty and colorful. With every cherry she added, Laura thought about all the fun times she and Lindsey had shared together. With the giant caramel sundae finished and looking amazing, Laura carefully carried it over to Lindsey's house. She was so excited to see her friend's reaction and share the sweet dessert with her.

Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November.

Article: Here's a new warning from health experts: sitting is deadly. Scientists are increasingly warning that sitting for long periods, even if you exercise regularly, could be bad for your health. And it doesn't matter where the sitting takes place--in the office, at school, in the car or before a computer or TV. Just the overall number of hours it takes matters. Several studies suggest people who spend most of their days sitting are more likely to be fat, have a heart attack or even die. While health officials have issued guidelines advising on the least amounts of physical activities, they haven't suggested people try to limit how much time they spend in a seated position. \\"After four hours of sitting, the body starts to send harmful signals,\\" said Ekblom-Bak of the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences. She explained that genes controlling the amount of glucose and fat in the body start to shut down. Even for people who exercise, spending long periods of time sitting at a desk is still harmful. Tim Armstrong, a physical activity expert at the World Health Organization, said people who exercise every day but still spend a lot of time sitting might get more benefits if that exercise were spread across the day, rather than in a single hour. Still in a study that tracked more than 17,000 Canadians for about a dozen years, researchers found people who sat more had a higher death risk, whether they exercised or not. Experts said more research is needed to figure out just how much sitting is dangerous, and what might be possible to _ those effects. People should keep exercising because that has a lot of benefits,\\" Ekblom-Bak said. \\"And when they're in the office, they should try to interrupt sitting as often as possible.\\" Question: Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?

I had a problem, I think with any addiction you have to be ready to make the choice, whether it's cigarettes or anything. You have to just commit and you just have to stick with it.

Please answer the following question: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? - Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same. - not enough information - They will be enrolled in a study. - They will call their doctor.

Given the question: In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Here is a hypothesis: Volcanic activity and erosion formed the red-granite cliffs and boulders here. Here are the options: Options: +yes +it is not possible to tell +no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise suggests that the rugged red-granite cliffs and boulders have come about due to volcanic eruptions and the subsequent erosion by wind and water at sea, resulting in their distinctive shapes. When you analyse the hypothesis which states that \\"Volcanic activity and erosion formed the red-granite cliffs and boulders here,\\" it follows the same idea as presented in the premise. The hypothesis is a simplified explanation of the premise, but both of them refer to the same process of formation of the red-granite cliffs and boulders. The \\"volcanic activity\\" mentioned in the hypothesis is a broad term that covers the \\"volcanic eruptions\\" from the premise, suggesting the initial origin of these geological features. Next, the \\"erosion\\" mentioned in the hypothesis is primarily due to \\"wind and water\\", as indicated in the premise. The result of this process, which involves wearing down and reshaping, leads to the creation of the distinctive \\"red-granite cliffs and boulders.\\" Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that, based on the premise, the hypothesis is also true. Both the premise and the hypothesis describe two key processes involved—volcanic activity (or eruptions) and erosion (by wind and water)—in shaping the observed red-granite cliffs and boulders.

Fact: as the supply of food in an environment decreases , the population of animals in that environment will decrease Question: Predators which rely on small rodents for food will do what when rodents all die off? What's the answer? pick from the following. 1). become vegetarians. 2). increase in population. 3). have more food. 4). have lower numbers.","completion":"The answer is 4). have lower numbers. Here's why: When an organism, such as a predator, is dependent upon another organism for sustenance, it forms part of a delicate food chain or web. This relationship is best defined by the principle of \\"supply and demand\\" from economics which, in an ecological context, translates into the predator-prey relationship. The idea is that when the supply of food increases, it benefits the population of the consumer (the predator in this case). However, when there's a decrease in the supply of food, it negatively affects the population of the predator. Therefore, if the small rodents, which serve as the primary food source for these predators, completely die off, the predators will find it tough to survive. Many predators are specialized hunters, finely tuned over millennia to prefer certain prey. Switching to another food source is not always easy – in many cases, it's not possible at all, given the various adaptations developed for a specific type of prey. This scarcity of their primary food source would lead to increased competition among the predators, and not every predator would be able to adapt to these new conditions. Over time, less successful hunters may begin to starve, reduce their reproductive rate, or die more frequently from other causes, eventually leading their population to diminish. In extreme cases, the predator species might even face extinction if it failed to find an alternative food source. So, going by the options provided, the predator population would certainly not become vegetarians, increase in population, or have more food. They would most likely have lower numbers as a result of a decrease in food supply. Please note that while this is the immediate response to such a change, nature has numerous mechanisms (like adaptation and migration) that can help species survive in the long term. However, such processes often take a substantial amount of time and are beyond the scope of this immediate response to the rodent population dying off."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The US government has started a website, Admongo, to help children think critically about the advertising aimed at them. It claims to provide visitors with an \\"education\\" through games and other amusement. A cartoon man dressed in old time pilot clothing greets visitors to Admongo. \\"Call me Haiz\\", he says upon arrival in a rocket ship that opens up with a crazy world inside it. Spacey dance music plays in the background as Haiz tells visitors that they need to learn about advertising. Its inventors say eight to twelve years old is the age kids develop their critical thinking abilities. Kids that age are also a big market for advertisers. The idea behind Admongo is to teach children three things: To _ the advertiser. To know what the advertiser is really saying. And to know what the advertisement is trying to get the child to do. Children learn these things through a video game. They create their own game character. They can choose different skin colors, hair styles, eye and mouth shapes. Then they begin a trip through ad-land, where there are ads on buses and billboards. The players have to find all the marketing in the neighborhood before they can move on to the next level. The Admongo game takes players inside a home, to the advertising studio and everywhere else ads can be found. It is a complete exploration of the world of marketing. One such area is food marketing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says it is a big business. The FTC estimates that food, drink and fast-food restaurants spent more than one and a half billion dollars on advertising to young people in 2010. The FTC says children are important for three reasons. They buy products. They influence parents and caregivers to buy. And they are the future adult buyers of the products. A recent study says most advertising aimed at children is for foods of the lowest nutritional value. First Lady Michelle Obama has said she would like to see advertisers marketing healthy foods for children.

All of Karl Popper's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Grübl and, after Grübl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Grübl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Grübl's first name was Carl.) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000–14,000 volumes in his personal library.

The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - Bavaria is a federal state of Germany.

The gang is led by Hando (Russell Crowe) and his friend and second in command, Davey (Daniel Pollock). They meet drug addict Gabrielle (Jacqueline McKenzie) the day after her sexually abusive, highly affluent father Martin (Alex Scott), has her junkie boyfriend beaten up. Gabrielle starts a romantic association with Hando.Some of gang's skinhead friends visit from Canberra, one of whom has joined the Royal Australian Navy and is home on leave. After a long night of drinking, fighting, and sex, two members of the gang go to their local pub. Unbeknown to them the owner has sold it to a Vietnamese Australian businessman. Upon seeing the new owner and his sons, they inform Hando. Hando and his gang arrive and savagely beat the new owner's sons. A third Vietnamese youth phones for help, and several armed Vietnamese men descend on the skinheads. The Vietnamese outnumber the skinheads and a few are killed. The Vietnamese force them to retreat to their rented warehouse, where the Vietnamese ransack the building before setting it on fire.The skinheads find a new base at a nearby warehouse after evicting a pair of squatters, and plan their revenge against the Vietnamese.

Say this using Spanish.","completion":"El proceso se completa mediante el reposo del vino sobre sus lías en contenedores de acero inoxidable. Para explicar esto con más detalle y en un formato más extenso, empezaremos describiendo brevemente el contexto general de la producción de vino. La elaboración del vino es un proceso meticuloso y complejo que pasa por diversas etapas previas a la obtención del producto final. Cada etapa es esencial para garantizar la calidad y el sabor que se espera del vino. Primero, las uvas son cosechadas y seleccionadas cuidadosamente para asegurar que solo las mejores y más sanas sean utilizadas en la producción. Luego, las uvas pasan por el proceso de despalillado y estrujado, donde se retiran los racimos y las uvas se rompen para liberar su jugo. A continuación, el mosto, que es el líquido que resulta de la extracción del jugo de la uva, se fermenta en tanques o barricas. Durante este proceso, el azúcar del mosto se transforma en alcohol, gracias a la acción de las levaduras que actúan sobre él. Cuando la fermentación ha concluido, el vino se trasiega -es decir, se separa del sedimento que se ha formado durante la fermentación-, dejando atrás las lías, que son las levaduras muertas y otras partículas sólidas que se acumulan en el fondo del recipiente. Aquí es donde entramos en la etapa que mencionas en tu pregunta: el reposo del vino sobre sus lías en contenedores de acero inoxidable. El reposo del vino sobre sus lías es una técnica enológica que busca mejorar el vino a través del contacto prolongado con estos sedimentos. Este proceso, denominado en francés \\"surlie\\" y en español \\"sobrelías\\", aporta al vino ciertas características organolépticas específicas como una textura más cremosa, mayor complejidad aromática y una mejor estructura en boca. Los contenedores de acero inoxidable son particularmente adecuados para este proceso por varias razones. Primero, el acero inoxidable es un material inerte que no reacciona con el vino ni le confiere sabores o aromas indeseables. En segundo lugar, los tanques de acero inoxidable son de fácil limpieza y desinfección, lo que ayuda a mantener un ambiente higiénico en el que se reduce el riesgo de contaminación o alteración del vino. Por último, los tanques de acero inoxidable permiten un control preciso de la temperatura, lo cual es esencial para el correcto desarrollo del proceso de reposo sobre lías. En resumen, el reposo del vino sobre sus lías en contenedores de acero inoxidable es una etapa crucial en la elaboración del vino, que tiene como objetivo aportar características específicas al producto final, tales como textura, aroma y sabor. El uso de contenedores de acero inoxidable tiene numerosas ventajas en términos de calidad del vino y facilidad de control en la producción."},{"prompt":"Question: Combine facts and answer this: Which of the film in which Jimmi Harkishin was featured is a 1999 British comedy-drama film written by Ayub Khan-Din and directed by Damien O'Donnell?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which city has lower air pressure? There are two neighboring cities, Brampton and Filtroy. The two towns depend on each other by trading supplies and goods regularly. Filtroy is located on top of a very tall mountain, and Brampton is situated at the base of this hill. For this reason, it can sometimes be difficult to traverse the roads to trade goods, but it's important to do it so both cities can thrive. Hint: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health. The answer is:","completion":"Filtroy has lower air pressure. Filtroy is located on top of a very tall mountain, and as mentioned in the hint, air pressure decreases as altitude increases. Since Brampton is situated at the base of the hill, its air pressure is higher compared to Filtroy.

Question: Information: - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Styracocephalus platyrhynchus ( ' spike head ' ) is an extinct species of tapinocephalian therapsid that lived during the Guadalupian epoch . Styracocephalus ' head ornament meant that it could be recognised from a distance . The most striking feature of Styracocephalus are the large backward - protruding tabular horns . The crest stuck upwards and backwards , but there is some variation in its shape , and this suggests that it changed throughout life and that it may be sexually dimorphic . Styracocephalus was a herbivore that may have been fully terrestrial or partly aquatic like the modern hippopotamus . It may have evolved from the estemmenosuchids . Its remains are known from South Africa but it probably had a wider distribution . It was around 1.8 metres ( 5 ft 11 in ) in length , with a 42 centimetres ( 17 in ) long , 29 centimetres ( 11 in ) wide skull . - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period. - Tapinocephalus (\\"humble head\\") is a genus of large herbivorous dinocephalian that lived during the Middle Permian Period. These stocky, barrel-bodied animals were characterised by a massive bony skull roof and short weak snout. It is thought that, like the rest of the members of its family, the animals engaged in head-butting intraspecific behavior, possibly for territory or mates. The fossil remains (skull and postcranial elements) of \\"Tapinocephalus\\" are known from the Lower, Middle, and Upper part of the \\"Tapinocephalus\\" Assemblage Zone (Capitanian age) of the Lower Beaufort Beds of the South African Karoo. Only the type species, \\"T. atherstonei\\" is now considered valid for this genus. - Tapinocephalia is one of the major groups of dinocephalian therapsids and the major herbivorous group. Tapinocephalia is thought to consist of three clades: Styracocephalidae, Titanosuchidae, and the very successful Tapinocephalidae. Notable tapinocephalians include \\"Moschops\\", \\"Tapinocephalus\\", and \\"Titanosuchus\\". - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is \\"Tetraceratops insignis\\" from the Lower Permian. What is the relationship between 'styracocephalus' and 'genus'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'Styracocephalus' and 'genus' is that Styracocephalus is a specific genus within the Tapinocephalia group of therapsids. A genus is a classification rank in taxonomy, which groups together organisms that share common characteristics and are closely related. In this case, Styracocephalus is a particular genus of tapinocephalian therapsid with distinct features, such as the large backward-protruding tabular horns on its head."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Take your sharp pencil and draw an oval or seed shape that's as large as you want the eye to be. You'll need to draw a small half-circle that extends near the inner eye. This will be the tear duct. You can make the curved lid as close or as far from the eyelash line as you like. Keep in mind that some women don't have noticeable curves along the upper eyelid, so you may want to position it close to the eyelash line.","completion":"The task involves drawing a detailed eye by following a set of step-by-step instructions. First, select a sharp pencil to ensure precision in your drawing. Begin by sketching an oval or seed-shaped outline, which will represent the overall shape and size of the eye. This initial outline can be as large or small as desired, depending on the proportions of the intended subject or your preference. The next step is to draw the tear duct, a crucial element that adds realism to the eye. To do this, create a small half-circle near the inner edge of the eye, extending it outward from the main oval or seed shape. This is an essential detail for capturing the natural appearance of a human eye. Following the tear duct, focus on drawing the curved eyelid. This part of the eye can be customized depending on your preference or the style you wish to achieve. To create the eyelid, draw a curved line either close to or further away from the eyelash line, keeping in mind that the curvature varies from person to person. It is important to note that some women may not have a highly pronounced curvature along their upper eyelid, so positioning it close to the eyelash line may be the most realistic option in certain cases. In conclusion, the process of drawing a detailed eye can be broken down into multiple steps, involving the creation of an oval or seed-shaped outline, the addition of a tear duct through a small half-circle, and the incorporation of a curved eyelid that can be adjusted according to individual variations. Attention to detail and the use of a sharp pencil during this process will ensure that the eye is rendered as realistically and accurately as possible."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Reasoning: As awareness and concern for climate change grows, people will seek to reduce their carbon footprint and choose more eco-friendly options. Step 2: People opt for alternative heating methods. Reasoning: Given that burning oil releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants, as people care more about climate change, they will likely start exploring other heating options that have a smaller environmental impact, such as natural gas, electric, or renewable energy sources. Step 3: Demand for oil decreases. Reasoning: As more people move away from oil-based heating methods, the demand for oil will decrease, leading to less oil being placed in stoves and burnt.

I have no problem with divorce since, as others have stated, everyone has their reasons, however there was one person that I dated briefly but upon hearing the reason why he divorced I opted to end the relationship. I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? “Oh Definitely.” Oh good!

Use evidence from the fact that quartz scratches glass easily to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"Quartz can very easily damage\\" Options are: (A). smelted silica; (B). granite; (C). diamonds; (D). steel;","completion":"To answer this question, we need to consider the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. The Mohs scale is a qualitative ordinal scale that characterizes the scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of a harder material to scratch a softer material. The scale ranges from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond). Quartz has a Mohs hardness of 7, while glass has a Mohs hardness of around 5.5. Since quartz can easily scratch glass, it can also scratch any materials that are equal to or softer than glass on the Mohs scale. Now, let's evaluate the options: (A). Smelted silica: Silica is the primary component of glass. Smelted silica would have a similar hardness to glass. So, quartz can easily scratch smelted silica. (B). Granite: Granite is an igneous rock composed mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. Quartz makes up a significant portion of granite, and since it is one of the harder components, granite has a Mohs hardness between 6 and 7. Quartz can scratch materials softer than itself, so it might be able to scratch some softer granites but not all. (C). Diamonds: Diamonds have a Mohs hardness of 10, which is harder than quartz. Quartz cannot scratch diamonds. (D). Steel: Steel has a Mohs hardness of around 4 to 4.5, which is softer than quartz. Therefore, quartz can scratch steel. Based on the Mohs hardness scale, the best answer is (A). smelted silica, as quartz can very easily damage it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758.

His mother was moaning over it, and there was no place to sit down. He did not wonder that Jem had taken his hunch of bread and gone away with it, nor that his father was not at home; but he took off his boots at the back door, as his aunt never liked his coming into her room in them--though they were nothing to what he would have worn had he worked in the fields--and then climbed up the stairs. Judith was sitting up in bed, with her teapot, tea-cup, and a piece of stale loaf, laid out on a tray before her; and little Judy beside her, drinking out of a cracked mug.

The name of which Greek god is used to describe a handsome man???","completion":"The name of the Greek god used to describe a handsome man is Adonis. Adonis is often referred to as the epitome of male beauty and attractiveness in Greek mythology. Born from the unique circumstances involving his mother, Myrrha, and her father, King Cinyras, Adonis was a symbol of remarkable beauty and youth. According to the myth, Myrrha fell in love with her father, and Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, caused this strange affection as a form of punishment because Myrrha's mother boasted about her daughter's beauty, claiming it to surpass even that of Aphrodite. To be with her father, Cinyras, Myrrha disguises herself and tricks him into sleeping with her. When Cinyras discovers the truth, he chases Myrrha away, and she flees in fear. As she appeals to the gods for mercy, they transform her into a myrrh tree. Adonis is then born from this tree when it splits open, aided by the nurturing care of Aphrodite. Adonis' striking looks and charm quickly beguiled Aphrodite and Persephone, the goddess of the underworld. Both goddesses desired him as their consort, making them rivals. Zeus, the king of the gods, ultimately made the decision that Adonis would split his time between the two goddesses. As a result, he would spend one-third of the year with Aphrodite, one-third with Persephone, and the remaining one-third with whoever he preferred, which ended up being Aphrodite. Sadly, Adonis' life was not destined to last long. Aphrodite warned him about the dangers of hunting but, despite her warnings, Adonis pursued hunting as a sport. One day while hunting alone, he encountered a fierce wild boar that gored him to death. It is believed that the boar was sent by either Ares, who was jealous of Adonis for being Aphrodite's lover, or Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, who wanted to punish him. When Aphrodite learned of Adonis' death, she turned his spilled blood into an anemone flower, symbolizing her sorrow and the brevity of his life. This myth has continued to be an inspiration in art and literature, symbolizing the fleeting nature of beauty and life. Consequently, the name \\"Adonis\\" has become synonymous with male beauty and attractiveness. When someone describes a man as an \\"Adonis,\\" they are emphasizing his remarkable physical appearance, often highlighting his chiseled features, toned physique, and overall allure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Find a sterile bottle that's large enough to hold the water and pour 4 cups (0.95 L) of warm tap water directly into it. To sterilize the bottle, boil it in water for 5 minutes or run it through your dishwasher on the hottest setting. Although tap water is safe to use, you can also use distilled water. The water should be comfortably warm, somewhere between 98 and 104 °F (37 and 40 °C). Use a measuring spoon to drop the table salt right into the bottle with the warm water. It's important not to eyeball the amount of salt or the solution might not be the correct strength. Ensure the cap is screwed on tightly so no water leaks and vigorously shake the bottle until you see the salt dissolve in the water. This should take around 30 seconds. The saline solution will be clear since there's very little salt in comparison to the water. Your doctor should tell you how much saline solution to use, but adults, in general, will need to pour 2 cups (470 ml) of the solution into the bag. Kids between the ages of 6 and 12 should get 1 1⁄2 cups (350 ml) of saline solution while children between the ages of 2 and 6 should use 3⁄4 cup (180 ml).

The 29-year-old replaced Indian designer Manish Arora as Women's Ready-to-Wear Artistic Director at the French fashion house in June. She began her career at Studio BerÃ§ot in Paris, then took up an internship at Yves Saint Laurent, before joining Martine Sitbon, helping her establish her private line Rue de Mail, followed by a few seasons at Givenchy. Maurer, who has just shown her debut spring/summer 2013 collection for Paco Rabanne at Paris Fashion Week, was born in Germany to a German father and a Colombian mother and at the age of three moved to Mexico. She spent her childhood traveling widely across South America before settling in Paris. She sees herself as a mix of her German side, the designer who thinks about utility and shape and her South American side, which is more instinctive and into meshing together textures and colors. The biggest reward, she says, is creating a collection that persists after the fashion show and seeing that people really want to wear the clothes and the garments do not live on the rack. Read more: Boxing's first female Olympic gold medalist: 'I thought I couldn't continue' Here she talks to CNN's Human to Hero about her childhood interest in fashion, her career to date and the challenges that she faces in her new job. On her childhood interest in fashion ... When I was a child I was always very interested in images, in materials and textures. I just tended to put them in a bag that I would always carry with me, and I would stitch them together or, like, staple them together and make sort of fabrics out of them. I felt that since my childhood I've always loved doing this, and it's what I do naturally -- I mean, I don't need to make an effort to do it. On the influence of living in South America .... I traveled a lot so I would just soak in a lot of feelings, a lot of colors ... and I've always been somebody who likes to record things, so I would ... start taking pictures and making drawings, or taking leaflets and pamphlets and postcards, fabrics, things everywhere and just collect them. It was also I guess my cultural background which is quite rich. I think that it's that sensibility to color also, to materials mostly that people always saw in me. On studying at Studio BerÃ§ot ... You have to know where you're going and what it is that attracts you to be there, to survive in a school like that. They expect collections from you, but no one tells you what to be inspired by ... It forces you to follow your own path, which I feel is the only key to being a good fashion designer. On being appointed Artistic Director of Women's Ready-to-Wear at Pace Rabanne ... I have to represent a company, a fashion house that is historic ... that's always attached to the '60s, and now the biggest challenge is to bring it forward to our times. This is not a fashion house that's purely about style, but mostly about handwork and craftsmanship, and texture and material. On her debut collection for Paco Rabanne ... Nowadays women want things that are ... more functional but at the same time we've such an affluence of clothes and brands that are very wearable, that we also are looking for things that are very precise and very special, like sort of extraordinary pieces. It's also important to balance for me in this collection, the wearable side with the extraordinary piece side. So I, I basically wanted to do something a little bit psychedelic, something that is a little bit '60s but in a ... magic way. Something mysterious. On where she gets inspiration ... We can have our phone and take photos with our iPhone anytime, any place. I travel and I love to bring things back ... even just books or even a shell. Anything can be interesting. On the real purpose of a fashion designer ... In the end, what you're doing is not just supposed to be living for one fashion show, and then you pack it and put it in the archives. It's about giving your creations an afterlife.

Available options: 1). Yes. 2). No. The answer is:","completion":"2). No. The answer \\"bored\\" is not a valid response to the question \\"How would Austin feel afterwards?\\" after having eye surgery, as this question is primarily focusing on Austin's emotional and physical state following the surgery. It is important to consider various factors when assessing Austin's potential feelings post-operation. Firstly, it is crucial to focus on the immediate physical effects of the surgery on his eyes. It is probable that Austin will experience some discomfort, pain, or sensitivity in his eyes for some time following the procedure. Initially, he might feel relieved that the surgery is over, and he might be excited or anxious about the improvements in his vision that the surgery promises. Furthermore, given that Austin's eyesight has presumably improved following the surgery, he may experience a range of emotions in response to this change. He is likely to feel joy, gratitude, and amazement as he adjusts to his newfound visual clarity. The ability to see better can significantly enhance Austin's quality of life, allowing him to more fully engage in activities that had previously been a challenge. It is also essential to consider any concerns or fears Austin may have about the procedure or recovery process. He might be worried about potential complications, ensuring that he follows post-operative care instructions correctly, and any follow-up appointments that may be required. These concerns could give rise to such feelings as anxiety, stress, or apprehension. At a later stage, once Austin has fully recovered from the surgery and adapted to his improved vision, boredom might potentially be a plausible response to a situation in which he is no longer visually challenged by daily activities. However, this reaction would be unrelated to his feelings regarding the surgery itself or its immediate aftermath. In conclusion, the answer \\"bored\\" is not an appropriate response to the question about Austin's feelings after getting eye surgery. The more accurate answers would be related to his physical condition, emotional reactions to the surgery and its outcome, and any concerns or anxieties he may have surrounding the procedure and recovery process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Turner ran for three touchdowns and the Atlanta Falcons scored the first 24 points to beat Kansas City 38-14, giving the Chiefs their 12th straight loss. Turner had scoring runs of 4, 1 and 2 yards, his first career game with three rushing touchdowns, while leading the Falcons with 104 yards rushing. Jerious Norwood added 75 yards rushing.Turner dragged Chiefs linebacker Pat Thomas for a few steps before breaking free and running through other defenders for a 38-yard run from the Falcons 8. A 30-yard pass from Ryan to Norwood helped set up Turner first touchdown run. Turner 1-yard scoring run in the second quarter gave Atlanta a 24-0 lead. Turner determined run helped to soften the Kansas City defense. Ryan found Roddy White for a 70-yard touchdown pass on Atlanta's next possession, and the Falcons were on their way to a big early lead, ( Ryan 70-yard touchdown pass to White is the longest pass completion for the Falcons since 12/23/07 when wide receiver Laurent Robinson caught a 74-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Chris Redman against the Arizona Cardinals in a Week 16 meeting) . On Kansas City first offensive possession of the game, defensive end John Abraham logged his fifth sack of the season, which led to a Chiefs punt. Abraham tallied his second sack of the game at the end of the third quarter, which included a forced fumble. The two sacks gave Abraham eight in his last four games, 16 in his last 18 games and 73.5 for his career. Entering the Kansas City game, he led the NFL with four sacks after three games, the forced fumble was the 29th of his career, which ranks fourth in the NFL from 2000-2008. Turner sparked an Atlanta scoring drive when he posted a 38-yard rush in the first quarter, he capped the drive with a four-yard touchdown, his third of the season. The Falcons drove 92 yards in six plays and also received help from running back Jerious Norwood on the drive who contributed with 45 combined yards (two rushes for 15 yards and one 30-yard reception).Atlanta 92-yard scoring drive, the first of the game, is the longest scoring drive since 12/3/06 at Washington when the Falcons drove 98 yards on six plays capped by a Norwood touchdown run. Kicker Jason Elam was successful on his long field goal attempt of 27 yards against Kansas City, improving his streak of consecutive field goals to 27. Elam also added five extra points for an eight-point day. Tyler Thigpen, the third starting quarterback in three weeks for Kansas City, threw three interceptions in his first career start. The third interception, by cornerback Chris Houston, was returned 10 yards for a touchdown with 1:01 left in the game. Chiefs coach Herman Edwards said during the week he would turn to veteran Damon Huard if Thigpen struggled. Thigpen played the full game and was 14-for-36 passing for 128 yards with one touchdown. Down 24-0, Thigpen led a 13-play scoring drive capped by his 15-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Bowe with three seconds left in the first half. The Chiefs' 12th straight loss came 11 months to the day after their last win. They lost their last nine games in 2007 after a 12-10 win at Oakland on Oct. 21, 2007. The Chiefs comeback continued when Larry Johnson's 48-yard run set up his 1-yard scoring plunge to open the second half, cutting Atlanta lead to 24-14. It was Johnson first rushing touchdown of the season.Johnson, who had 96 yards rushing in his first two games, had 24 carries for 121 yards and a touchdown. Johnson has 4,981 yards rushing for his career to pass Christian Okoye (4,897) for second place on the Chiefs all-time list. The Falcons had a quick answer to Johnson touchdown. Ryan, making his third start, had a 15-yard run and a 17-yard pass to White to set up Turner third touchdown, a 2-yard run. The Chiefs were forced to punt on their first five possessions. Their next two drives ended with interceptions by Erik Coleman and Brent Grimes, Coleman intercepted his first career pass in a Falcons uniform, which also gave him the eighth of his career, it was Coleman first interception since 11/12/06 against the New England Patriots . Coleman pieced together a stellar performance against the Chiefs which included 10 tackles to lead the team and one forced fumble, and Grimes intercepted his first career pass when he stepped in front of a Tyler Thigpen pass in the second quarter. Grimes returned the interception 25 yards, which led to a Falcons touchdown. The Falcons defense allowed only 14 rushing yards in the first quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs, continuing their trend of holding opponents to under 15 rushing yards over the first three contests of the season. Against Tampa Bay in Week 2, Atlanta held the Bucs to two rushing yards in the opening 15 minutes of play, which was the lowest total in the first quarter of a game since for a Falcons opponent since 12/14/03 (vs. Colts, two rushing yards). Below is a look at Atlanta opponent rushing totals in the first quarter of each game this season. The Falcons moved to 2-0 at the Georgia Dome on the season and gave Head Coach Mike Smith his second career win as a head coach. Michael Turner became only the fifth Falcons running back in team history to register three or more touchdowns in a game, with the win over the Chiefs improved its record to 5-1 in its last six meetings against AFC West opponents.

Answer:","completion":"The best-known actor for his iconic portrayal of Dracula is Bela Lugosi, born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in Hungary in 1882. Lugosi cemented his place in the realm of horror films when he first took on the role of the infamous vampire, Count Dracula, in the classic 1931 film \\"Dracula.\\" This American pre-Code film, directed by Tod Browning and produced by Universal Pictures, is based on the 1897 Gothic horror novel \\"Dracula\\" by Irish author Bram Stoker. Before making his Dracula debut in Hollywood, Lugosi portrayed the undead Count on Broadway in a production adapted from Stoker's novel by John L. Balderston and Hamilton Deane. The Broadway play was a huge success, running for a year from October 5, 1927, to October 6, 1928. Lugosi's performance captured the imaginations of the audience and set him on the path to becoming a horror icon. When it was time to cast the film adaptation, despite Lugosi's popularity in the stage version of \\"Dracula,\\" he was not initially the top pick; Universal Pictures first sought out Lon Chaney, Sr for the role. However, after Chaney's unexpected death, Lugosi lobbied heavily for the role, keenly aware that it could be his big break. Finally, he was cast as Count Dracula, a role that would come to define his entire career. Lugosi's portrayal of the suave, dapper, and sinister Dracula was an unforgettable performance that received widespread acclaim from film historians and critics alike. He blended an intense, menacing presence with a seductive charm that personified the fictional vampire, creating an image that still stands as the archetypical representation of Dracula in popular culture. His thick Hungarian accent added an eerie touch to the character, providing a feeling of foreign otherness that evoked both fear and fascination. Unfortunately, Lugosi's unforgettable performance as Dracula also had a downside. It led to his typecasting in horror roles, making it difficult for him to break free from the image of the sinister vampire. He appeared in other prominent horror films throughout his career such as \\"White Zombie\\" (1932), \\"The Raven\\" (1935), \\"Son of Frankenstein\\" (1939), and \\"The Wolf Man\\" (1941). Despite his efforts to diversify his acting portfolio, he was inextricably linked with his portrayal of Dracula. Lugosi's career began to decline in the late 1940s, and he passed away in 1956. In summary, Bela Lugosi was best known for his role as Dracula, a role he first took on in the 1931 film adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. His performance became an iconic and lasting portrayal of the infamous vampire count, making Lugosi a legend in the world of horror cinema."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Census Shows Growing Diversity in New York City\\"","completion":"Title: Census Shows Growing Diversity in New York City Introduction New York City, known for being a melting pot of various cultures and ethnicities, has long been celebrated for its diversity. However, recent census data highlights that the city's diverse landscape is not only being maintained but is actually growing more vibrant than ever before. This increase in diversity presents opportunities for the city to foster greater inclusivity, collaborative creativity, and present itself as a beacon for other cities to follow. I. Census Data Highlights: According to the latest United States Census Bureau data, the population of New York City currently stands at over 8.8 million, making it the largest and one of the most diverse cities in the country. Compared to previous data, this census showcases the following remarkable trends in the city's demographic makeup: A. Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations: Among major ethnic groups, both Hispanic and Asian populations have seen significant growth in numbers. The Asian population has seen an increase of more than 10% while the Hispanic population accounts for nearly 29% of the total population. B. Increase in foreign-born residents: Foreign-born residents, who make up almost 37% of the city's population, have also experienced an upsurge in numbers. This shows that New York City continues to attract and accommodate people from all over the world. C. Stabilization in the African American population: After years of population decline, recent census data reveals that the African American population has remained stable, accounting for slightly more than 22% of the city's population. D. Decrease in the non-Hispanic white population: In stark contrast to other major demographic groups, the non-Hispanic white population of the city has observed a slight decrease. However, they still represent the largest ethnic group at 32%. II. Factors Contributing to Growing Diversity: Several factors contribute to the diversity we are experiencing in New York City today.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I am not even close to being a professional , but I pride myself in how cute these pictures are . Have I mentioned how hot it is right now ? Well , we went out to do these pictures at 7 am , so it would n't be too hot for outdoor pictures . Why is the narrator waking up so early in the morning ?","completion":"The narrator is waking up early in the morning for several reasons that revolve around taking outdoor pictures. Let's dive into a few aspects that might have motivated the narrator to make such a decision. 1. Temperature and Comfort: As the narrator mentions, it is currently very hot outside. By waking up and going out for the photoshoot at 7 am, they can take advantage of lower temperatures and a more comfortable atmosphere. This is not only important for the well-being of the people involved in the photo session, but also for the quality of the pictures themselves. Hot weather can cause sweating, discomfort, and fatigue, which might result in less favorable outcomes for the photographs. 2. Lighting Conditions: The early morning light is often considered one of the best times of day for outdoor photography. The soft, diffused light during this time is known as the \\"golden hour\\" and can add a beautiful, warm, and natural glow to the photos. The sunlight is less harsh compared to midday and can minimize shadows, glare, or overexposure in the images. By choosing to wake up early and do the photoshoot during this time, the narrator is aiming to capture their pictures in the most flattering light possible. 3. Privacy and Fewer Distractions: Another advantage of taking outdoor pictures early in the morning is that there may be fewer people around. Public places like parks or popular photography spots may not yet be crowded at 7 am, meaning that the narrator can have more privacy for their photoshoot. This can also help minimize distractions, noise, and other intrusions that could impact the quality of the photo session. 4. Higher Energy Levels and a Fresh Start: Starting the day early in the morning can provide the narrator and anyone else involved in the photoshoot with higher energy levels and a fresh outlook. Feeling rested and energized can contribute positively to the overall mood and atmosphere during the photography session and potentially lead to better results. In conclusion, the narrator's decision to wake up early in the morning for their outdoor photoshoot is driven by several factors, including temperature comfort, optimal lighting conditions, privacy, and higher energy levels. Each of these elements play a role in ensuring that the pictures turn out as \\"cute\\" and high-quality as the narrator desires."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the sentiment of the following review? Initial Impression and experience: So I have always loved Mongolian BBQ. I've dined at many in CA over the years, and this is the first one I've been to here in NV. When we walked up we were greeted outside the door and followed in to be seated right away. That was nice. We were sat at a table and told out waiter would be right with us. He came over and asked if we had ever been there. We said no, so he explained how it all works. Pretty easy to figure out, but whatever, we listened anyway. We got up and went to the food counter. All the food looked fresh and crisp. It was a little difficult to reach some of the items in the back because of the very low sneeze guard. The bowl they give you is VERY small, so everything you try to overstack falls off :/ We watched them cook our food for a minute, and they came over to let us know our appetizer was on the table for us. So we went over to sit and eat. Service: Service was on the a lot to be desired side. We each had a drink and they never refilled them for us. They actually took my boyfriends cup (like they were going to refill it) but never brought it back. They listened to my 13 year son over me on whether or not he was going to get all you can eat and brought him a second bowl to fill up anyway. I had to again tell them no, we are not getting all you can eat. Food: The food was fresh and very good sauces and spices were available. Price: TOO EXPENSIVE. There were 3 of us and we each got 1 bowl, an appetizer to share, and each a drink and we spent over 50. Too much to pay if you don't even end up with some left overs to take home. The price would have been fine if it was all you can eat that we did, but not for 1 tiny bowl. Overall: We enjoyed the food a lot, but there wasn't enough and it was too expensive. I would go back, but not for the price. Like another person said, it's almost double what you would pay in CA for the same thing. You can even get close to this same type of food at any buffet here is Vegas and pay less, but have other options as well. I really liked the food and would love to go back, but only if they drop their prices. - negative; - positive;","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mixed. On one hand, the person appreciated the quick seating, the freshness of the food, and the good sauces and spices. This is the positive part. On the other hand, the person had complaints about the service, they felt the portions were too small, and found the prices too expensive. All these lead to the negative sentiment. So, just like when we sometimes feel happy and sometimes feel sad, this person felt both positive and negative things about this restaurant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If The agonized expression on his face looks like a kind of rapture., can we conclude that \\"The expression on his face depicts rapture.\\"?","completion":"In order to determine if the statement \\"The expression on his face depicts rapture\\" is an accurate conclusion when given the information \\"The agonized expression on his face looks like a kind of rapture,\\" we need to examine the context and meanings of the terms involved, as well as the potential purpose behind describing the expression in such a manner. First, let's look at the meaning of \\"agonized\\" and \\"rapture.\\" According to the Cambridge dictionary, \\"agonized\\" refers to experiencing great mental anguish or physical pain, while \\"rapture\\" is described as an extreme feeling of pleasure, happiness, or excitement. Based on these definitions, one might initially perceive the terms as contradictory. However, it is crucial to recognize that language can be nuanced and subtle, and can be utilized in various ways to describe complex emotions or experiences. When we consider the context or circumstances of the individual experiencing the agonized expression, it is possible that the statement might be referring to a convoluted emotional state, in which one simultaneously experiences both suffering and an odd sense of pleasure or happiness. It could also be implying that the agonized expression has a visual similarity to rapture, without the person actually experiencing rapture. It's important to note that descriptions of facial expressions are highly subjective and often rely on the observer's interpretation of the scenario. When analyzing the given information, we could conclude that: 1. The narrator, or the person describing the facial expression, perceives the agonized expression as similar to a kind of rapture. It can either be a comparison or an observation of a curious mixture of conflicting emotions within the individual. 2. The person with the agonized expression is experiencing a particular situation, where the pain or suffering is coupled with some form of pleasure, happiness, or excitement, leading to a look that resembles rapture. 3. The description given is intentionally ambiguous, left open for interpretation, or aiming to hint at the complexity of human emotions. Thus, it is not a direct conclusion that \\"The expression on his face depicts rapture.\\" There is a possibility that the expression might be a blend of agony and rapture, or that the description is left open for interpretation to represent the complexities of human emotion. The accurate interpretation of the statement relies on contextual understanding and personal interpretation by the reader or observer. Language often functions to evoke thoughts and emotions, and in this case, the statement serves to highlight the intricate shades of human emotions and the fascinating interplay between pain and pleasure, agony and rapture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Background: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. Paragraph: Keith is a physician in a local hospital. He is treating a patient with respiratory problem. He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would the air pressure inside lungs increase or decrease in state A? A:","completion":"In state A, where the diaphragm contracts, the air pressure inside the lungs would decrease.

To prevent burning hands when lighting a candle, Available choices: (1). light a long, twisted roll of paper on fire to light the candle.. (2). put the fire on your palm instead of your fingers to light it..","completion":"To prevent burning hands when lighting a candle, there are two options available: (1) lighting a long, twisted roll of paper on fire to light the candle and (2) putting the fire on your palm instead of your fingers to light it. However, it is essential to note that the second option is not recommended as it can lead to severe burns or injuries. Therefore, the suggested and safer method is the first option: lighting a long, twisted roll of paper on fire to light the candle. Here is a detailed explanation of the procedure: 1. Choose the right materials: Select a piece of paper that is long enough to keep your hands at a safe distance from the flame. The ideal length of the paper depends on the depth of the candleholder and the height of the candle, but approximately 6-8 inches should suffice in most cases. Avoid using glossy or coated paper that can produce toxic fumes when burned. Instead, opt for plain, uncoated paper like newsprint or standard printer paper. 2. Roll the paper: Begin rolling the paper into a tube that is tight enough to hold a flame but not too tight to restrict airflow. Once the tube has taken shape, twist it along its entire length to increase stability and improve the structural integrity of the paper. Be cautious not to twist it too tightly, as this might also limit airflow and cause the paper to burn poorly. 3. Light the twisted roll of paper: Hold the twisted paper safely away from your body and ignite one end using a match or a lighter. Ensure you light the paper in such a way that the flame does not reach your fingers as it burns. 4. Light the candle: Once the flame is burning steadily on the end of the twisted roll of paper, carefully lower it towards the candle wick. Hold the flame to the wick until it ignites. If the candle is inside a jar, ensure that the twisted roll of paper is long enough to reach the wick without bringing your hands too close to the rim or the sides of the jar, which may become hot and cause burns. 5. Extinguish the twisted roll of paper: After successfully lighting the candle, blow out the flame on the twisted roll of paper or allow the paper to burn out in a safe and controlled manner. Make sure to extinguish the paper in a non-flammable container, such as a tin or ceramic dish, to prevent accidental fires. 6. Dispose of the used paper: Once the twisted roll of paper has cooled enough to handle, discard it in an appropriate waste receptacle. By following these steps, you can light a candle without risking burns to your hands. Remember that safety should always be your top priority when working with open flames. And always be mindful of the surface you place your candle on while ensuring proper supervision and containment to avoid fire accidents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After taking office, Young emphasized increasing racial diversity in the police department. Young also worked to improve Detroit's transportation system, but tension between Young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term. In 1976, the federal government offered 600 million for building a regional rapid transit system, under a single regional authority. But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit. Following the failure to reach an agreement over the larger system, the City moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the Detroit People Mover.

State officials confirmed the arrests and the ongoing search for the other perpetrators of the heinous act. This incident has put the spotlight on Mali’s security situation and has urged the need for further efforts to restore stability in the West African country. The Hotel Siege in Bamako On a fateful day, a group of heavily armed militants stormed a hotel in the city of Bamako, taking several guests and hotel staff as hostages. After an intense standoff with the Malian security forces and the intervention of French military forces, the siege was brought to an end. However, the tragic outcome totaled 22 fatalities, including nationals of various countries and hotel employees. The attackers, whose affiliations are still under investigation, had managed to infiltrate the hotel premises, equipped with explosives and automatic weapons. They executed their brutal plan with ruthless precision, leaving the nation and the international community shocked and devastated. The Response of the Malian Special Forces The timely intervention of the Malian special forces played a critical role in bringing the hotel siege to an abrupt end. Supported by French military forces and other international partners, they managed to free the hostages and neutralize the assailants. In the subsequent investigations of the scene, crucial evidence was uncovered, which led to the arrest of two suspects who are believed to be connected to the dreadful incident. These arrests are significant for two reasons: first, they signal progress in unraveling the complex network of the assailants, who are presumably linked to extremist groups operating in the Sahel region. Second, they demonstrate the commitment and capacity of the Malian security forces to combat terrorism, despite facing multiple challenges at the domestic front. The Broader Security and Political Context in Mali As a landlocked country in West Africa, Mali has been grappling with several security challenges over the past decade. Ranging from political instability to the rise of extremist groups in the north, Mali has struggled to maintain law and order within its borders. The continuous escalation of terrorist activities has been a pressing concern for the state and its international partners. Large-scale internal displacements, poverty, and marginalization have created a breeding ground for extremist groups to influence and recruit the disillusioned youth. The hotel siege in Bamako, albeit not uncommon in the region, serves as a stark reminder of the urgency to address these threats more effectively. The Role of the International Community In response to the proliferating extremist forces in the Sahel region, several countries, along with international organizations, have been steadfastly supporting counter-terrorism efforts in Mali and its neighboring countries. The United Nations, African Union, European Union, and several bilateral partnerships have focused on providing military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Mali. While there have been some commendable measures and initiatives in recent years, the hotel siege in Bamako makes it apparent that the battle against terrorism in Mali is far from over. A more robust and united international cooperation, complemented by enhanced grassroots initiatives in Mali, is of utmost importance to secure a future free from the shackles of terrorism. Conclusion The arrests of two suspects in connection with the deadly hotel siege in Bamako signify a meaningful advance in the ongoing fight against terrorism in Mali. These arrests should serve as a motivating force for the Malian security forces and the international community to step up their collaborative efforts to combat the scourge of terrorism that plagues Mali and the Sahel region at large. As Malians grieve for the 22 lives lost in the ruthless attack, the hope for lasting peace and stability in the country remains unshaken. The relentless pursuit of justice and unwavering determination to defeat the forces of terror will ultimately pave the way for a safer and more prosperous Mali."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the place that the legacy of its industrial past can be seen in its six surviving cotton mills? is inside the article: Shaw and Crompton is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines, 2.3 miles (3.7 km) north of Oldham, 3.6 miles (5.8 km) southeast of Rochdale, and 8.7 miles (14 km) to the northeast of the city of Manchester. It is regularly referred to as Shaw. Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was originally known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, as a result of an interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989. Shaw and Crompton, which covers 4.5 square miles (11.7 km2), is a predominantly suburban area of mixed affluence with a population of 21,065 as of 2011.

Q: What is to happen with the Yeerks ?","completion":"The Yeerks are likely to make a home on Earth. This choice seems more plausible considering several factors that make Earth a suitable target for their colonization plans. Firstly, the Yeerks are a parasitic species that require hosts in order to survive and thrive. Earth is home to a vast population of humans, which would be ideal hosts for the Yeerks. The large number of potential hosts available on Earth would enable the Yeerks to spread and expand their influence exponentially, making Earth a strategically favorable location for their plans. Additionally, human beings possess advanced cognitive abilities, making them even more valuable as hosts for the Yeerks, who seek to control and manipulate their host's knowledge, skills, and resources for their own ends. Secondly, Earth's environment and resources could be of great use to the Yeerks. As a species that values technology and power, the Yeerks would undoubtedly be interested in exploiting Earth's resources and infrastructure for their own benefit. Access to Earth's resources would allow the Yeerks to improve their technology, potentially developing new weapons and defenses that could further their domination of other species and planets. Thirdly, Earth's diverse range of habitats and ecosystems could be of interest to the Yeerks. Their ability to morph into different forms means they would be able to adapt to various environments easily, allowing them to blend in with Earth's native species and giving them the opportunity to study and interact with these ecosystems. This could potentially lead to the discovery of new morphs or other useful biological information that could be leveraged by the Yeerks in their ongoing quest for power and conquest. In conclusion, the Yeerks are most likely to make a home on Earth due to the availability of a large human population to serve as hosts, access to valuable resources and infrastructure, and the diverse array of ecosystems that can be exploited for their benefit. The potential for rapid expansion and the acquisition of wealth and power makes Earth an attractive target for the Yeerks and one they are likely to pursue in their journey toward galactic domination."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
