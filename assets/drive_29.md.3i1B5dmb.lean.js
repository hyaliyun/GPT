Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Louise Eccles for Daily Mail. Millions of employees in a workplace pension scheme are to be freed from punitive curbs on savings imposed by Brussels. Earners were limited to £4,600 a year in contributions as part of the government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). They were also barred from transferring old company pensions into the scheme or taking it with them if they moved jobs. Pensions Minister Steve Webb (pictured) said: 'By convincing Europe to support us on this, we’ve achieved a victory for consumers' But after a year of negotiation, the European Commission has agreed to lift the restrictions in a ‘victory’ for employees, ministers will announce today. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: ‘This is a common sense decision which will help people to save and give certainty and confidence to employers choosing to use NEST. ‘By convincing Europe to support us on this, we’ve achieved a victory for consumers.’ However, savers will have to wait until April 1, 2017 for the changes to kick in. The low-cost, not-for-profit pension was designed for small businesses and low to moderate earners who could not afford to pay into more expensive company pensions. More than 1.5million workers have joined since 2012 – and the figure is expected to reach four million in the next three years. The European Commission imposed restrictions because of fears that a state-funded pension scheme could distort or threaten competition from private pension firms. Frances O’Grady, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ‘great news for savers’ Mr Webb said it had put many businesses off because it would have meant running two parallel pensions – one for higher earners and NEST for low-income staff. Relaxing the rules meant workers could avoid having ‘pensions scattered all over the place’, which risked people losing track of their savings, he said. The move comes after pressure from union and employer groups, the National Association of Pension Funds, NEST and criticism from MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee. Frances O’Grady, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ‘great news for savers’. ‘It was always ridiculous that people could not save as much as they wanted into NEST,’ she added. Mr Webb defended the 2017 deadline, saying Parliament was ‘littered’ with legislation that had been rushed through and blamed the delay on lengthy consultations with the pension industry and Eurocrats. NEST was introduced alongside automatic enrolment, which forces every boss to pay into a pension for workers who are over 22 and earn at least £10,000 by 2018. Highlights:","completion":"1. The European Commission has agreed to lift restrictions on the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) pension scheme. 2. This means employees will no longer be limited to £4,600 a year in contributions and can transfer old company pensions into the scheme. 3. The changes will take place on April 1, 2017. 4.

One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6] Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7] With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7] The hospital in Y city had a good disposal site in which they disposed of Biomedical wastes, but the hospital in the neighboring city X had big problems, because the biomedical waste contaminated the ground water and affected the population.

But UKIP's spokesman on migration Steven Woolfe MEP said there is no room in the party for xenophobic comments. UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said Mr Bennett's comments are not the views of the party. Mr Bennett was quoted in WalesOnline saying: \\"I think in Cardiff the starkest area which has changed completely is City Road. \\"That's probably where we have a multiplicity, a melting pot of different races all getting on each other's nerves, I think, and certainly causing lots of problems because of different cultural attitudes, very visible problems of rubbish which is being left on the street uncollected all the time.\\" Mr Bennett was asked on BBC's Daily Politics what evidence he had for his claim. He said: \\"I haven't got any firm evidence to give you now.\\" He said he had sent a draft legal letter to UKIP, saying \\"if they try to deselect me without due process they will face a legal action from me for lost earnings of Â£300,000\\". Mr Woolfe told BBC's Daily Politics: \\"It's not for me to actually make the deselection process. \\"That will be the NEC and I understand that they will do so.\\" The MEP added: \\"If he has also said that in terms of the language that you blame migrants or those who come to this country for all the ills of this country, if there is a tone of any form of racism in there whatsoever I will be demanding that the NEC takes the strongest terms possible to deal with this man. \\"I would ask those who have examined him and approved him that they too should be reprimanded by the NEC because there is no room in this party... for anyone who makes any racist, xenophobic or other types of comments\\". Nathan Gill, leader of UKIP Wales, said the NEC have ratified the candidate lists \\"subject to a final ongoing assessment which we are in the middle of and which takes place right up until the paperwork is presented to the electoral offices\\". \\"The comments that Mr Bennett made, [and] also his performance in the media, will play a major part in that assessment,\\" he said. Mr Gill said he didn't share \\"any of the views that Mr Bennett has expressed about immigration in Cardiff. We as a party are not anti-immigration, we are anti uncontrolled immigration and uncontrolled immigration only. We want an Australian-style points based system.\\" \\"Mr Bennett has expressed his own views and they are clearly not the views of the party,\\" he added. A UKIP Wales source called for his deselection. He said it was \\"absolutely crazy\\" to blame immigration for rubbish, and said a lot of candidates wanted the issue \\"dealt with properly\\", although he had a right to a \\"fair trial\\". The source also criticised the fact that Mr Bennett had spoken about immigration \\"when it isn't a devolved issue\\". UKIP's central office has told BBC Wales that it \\"will not make any comment about the matter until they have spoken with Mr Bennett\\".

The pesky fish, which the Michigan Department of Natural Resources describes as having the ability to cause \\"economic, ecological, and human health harm,\\" may be placing a 7 billion fishing industry at stake, as well as 38 billion from tourism and water recreation, per the DNR's \\"Invasive Carp Challenge\\" page. Eckert has a couple of proposals of his own, though based on the column's tone, it doesn't appear he expects either one to be scooped up. One option, he says: Fill the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects the Mississippi River Basin to the Great Lakes—and which basically serves as a conduit for the carp to infiltrate—with sand (an option others have suggested as well). But Eckert notes that those opposed to the plan cite the increased transportation costs for some local businesses that would result. His second plan, and probably more of a long shot: Convince Lansing to give up its annual revenue to pay anglers to take the carp out. \\"It worked for wolves,\\" he says. Meanwhile, the Lansing State Journal discusses a documentary by two filmmakers who grew up in the region on all of the different invasive species in the Great Lakes.

You are given a new situation: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. and a hint : Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Please answer this question : Which farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn? Answer:","completion":"Orange farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn because they did not grow cover crops on their parcels of land. Growing cover crops helps in promoting mycorrhizal growth throughout the autumn, winter, and spring, leading to a more extensive hyphal network and better crop yield."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Earlier, Wales' Jamie Jones beat David Gilbert 6-2, while Scot Higgins saw off Mark Allen 6-3 to earn a last-eight tie with world number one Mark Selby in York. Belgium's Luca Brecel beat world number 19 Stephen Maguire 6-3. Williams' progress means Wales have two quarter-finalists in the UK Championship for the first time since he and Matthew Stevens in 2001. Highfield showed impressive calmness and consistency against the 1999 and 2002 champion, but Williams kept in touch and held his nerve to close out victory in an error-strewn decider. \\"I am just happy to get over the line,\\" said 41-year-old Williams. \\"I was so nervous. I was twitching all over the place at the end and so was he. \\"I am looking forward to playing him [Ronnie]. It will be a great occasion. He is the best player to ever pick a cue up.\\" World number 39 Jones profited from some sloppy potting to go 3-0 up against Gilbert, but missed a simple red in frame four to give the world number 21 a boost prior to the interval. Jones responded with a break of 96 and got the snooker he required as he won frame six on the black, before closing out victory. The 28-year-old will play Hong Kong's Marco Fu in Friday's evening session. Higgins, 41, is one of the tour's form men, winning both the China Championship and Champion of Champions in November. But Northern Irishman Allen overturned a 2-0 deficit with breaks of 78, 105 and 65 to go ahead. Higgins, a 28-time ranking event winner, levelled with a brilliant 101 and, after clinching a tense seventh frame, he closed out victory over the world number 10 with breaks of 68 and 90. \\"I will need to play a lot better than I have this week to win the next match,\\" said world number four Higgins. \\"I felt good at 2-0. But for the next two or three frames my concentration went haywire. I left easy chances and he was feeding off that. \\"I needed some help from Mark and I got it and that changed the game again.\\" Higgins' fellow Scot Maguire scored successive tons to tie the scores at 2-2 against world number 31 Brecel.

The phone has failed to meet my expectations on several fronts, and I feel obliged to share my grievances in this review. 1. Performance: The biggest letdown about the XYZ Smartphone is its subpar performance. The device is painfully slow and unresponsive, often taking several seconds to load applications and switch between screens. I've even experienced multiple instances of applications crashing and the phone freezing, requiring me to restart it. 2. Battery Life: Battery life is another significant issue with this smartphone. On a full charge, it barely lasts me half a day with minimal usage, and if I attempt to run multiple apps or use GPS navigation, the battery drains at an alarming rate. This lack of battery life becomes a huge inconvenience as I constantly need to carry a power bank or charger with me wherever I go. 3. Camera Quality: For a smartphone that touts its camera as a standout feature, I was extremely disappointed with the picture quality. The images often appear washed out or overly grainy, especially in low-light conditions. Moreover, the autofocus is slow and frequently fails to produce sharp images, making it a frustrating experience when trying to capture spontaneous moments. 4. Build Quality & Design: The build quality of the XYZ Smartphone leaves a lot to be desired. The phone feels cheap in the hand due to its flimsy plastic body, and the buttons on the side offer little tactile feedback. Furthermore, the device is quite bulky and doesn't have an ergonomic design, making it uncomfortable to hold for extended periods. 5. Software & User Interface: Lastly, the software and user interface of the XYZ Smartphone are far from impressive. There are numerous bloatware apps pre-installed on the device, which are difficult to remove and only serve to slow down the phone. Additionally, the interface itself is cluttered and unintuitive, making it challenging to navigate for both new and experienced smartphone users. In conclusion, I would strongly advise against purchasing the XYZ Smartphone due to its lackluster performance, poor battery life, disappointing camera, and substandard build quality. There are far better options available in the market that offer a much more satisfying user experience at a similar price point."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His original name was Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, and he was a prominent French military general during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. His rise to the Swedish throne was an extraordinary turn of events in European history. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte initially pursued a career in the law before enlisting in the French army in 1780. He advanced through the ranks during the French Revolution, fighting in several key battles such as the Battle of Fleurus and the Battle of Hohenlinden. In 1794, he was promoted to general and, by 1804, he had become one of the eighteen Marshals of France under the Napoleonic Empire. Despite his affiliations with Napoleon, Marshal Bernadotte maintained a certain distance from his political ambitions. His relations with the Emperor often fluctuated between trust and tension. Nevertheless, he continued to serve in various military capacities, including the Peninsular War and the War of the Fifth Coalition. In 1810, a major turning point in Bernadotte's life occurred when the childless King Charles XIII of Sweden sought an heir. The influential Swedish baron Carl Otto Mörner proposed Bernadotte as a candidate for the Swedish throne, citing his military prowess and reputation as a humane and fair commander. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to the idea, despite Bernadotte's resistance. On August 21, 1810, the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates elected Bernadotte as Crown Prince. He adopted the name Charles John (Karl Johan in Swedish) and converted from Catholicism to Protestantism as part of the condition for his acceptance as heir to the throne. In 1813, he became regent of Sweden as King Charles XIII’s health declined. During the final years of the Napoleonic Wars, Charles John, as Crown Prince of Sweden, allied with Russia, Prussia, and the United Kingdom in the Sixth Coalition against France. His forces fought alongside those of the other coalition members, contributing to Napoleon’s eventual defeat in 1814. In 1818, following the death of King Charles XIII, Charles John ascended to the throne as Charles XIV John of Sweden and Charles III John of Norway. His reign lasted until his death on March 8, 1844, and was marked by a strong focus on domestic development, fostering economic growth, and maintaining peace in turbulent Europe. In conclusion, Charles XIV John, originally known as Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte of France, was born in Pau, France, and later became the King of Sweden and Norway. His transition from French military general to Scandinavian monarch showcases the extraordinary circumstances of his life and the interconnected nature of European politics during the early 19th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My experience has been somewhat unsatisfactory, which is why I'm giving it a 2-star rating. First off, the app seems to consume a significant amount of battery on my device. I don't recall facing such an issue with other similar apps. Moreover, the performance isn't as smooth as I'd like it to be, with occasional lagging and crashes. While the user interface is quite intuitive, the overall functionality is very limited. The app is missing many essential features, and the ones that are present don't operate as efficiently as they should. Another issue that needs attention is the frequency of updates. Although updates are supposed to improve the app, I haven't noticed any significant changes or improvements with each new version so far. This shows a lack of commitment to addressing user concerns and fixing bug-related issues. Lastly, the app's privacy settings are not as user-friendly as they should be, making it difficult to manage permissions and secure personal information. In summary, com.google.android.gms has ample room for improvement. I hope that the developers take user feedback seriously and invest in enhancing the app's performance, features, and overall stability.

News article: Email 1K Shares [WASHINGTON, DC] At approximately 10:22am EST an email address assigned to a Sparrow Project volunteer received a communique by a party identifying itself as the decentralized hacker collective, Anonymous. The communique details a planned effort by the groups’s affiliates online to disrupt the online streaming and syndication of the President’s State of the Union Address, scheduled for 9pm EST. The communique goes on to elaborate that this action is in response to a proposed executive order that would reinstate the most protested elements of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Information Act (CISPA). In 2012 a synergistic movement of progressives, legislative reformers, online activists, and autonomous hackers successfully defeated CISPA and another controversial bill, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). Many credit Aaron Schwartz and the group which he cofounded, Demand Progress, with coordinating the successful campaign to stop these bills. The following is the communique in its entirety, edit marked in red. BEGIN COMMUNIQUE Article II, Sector 3 of the US Constitution, says the President “shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” At 9PM Eastern Standard Time, February [12], 2013 President Obama has planned to address a joint session of Congress to deliver the State of the Union Address. The following day, President Obama will be introducing an executive order, purportedly aimed at bolstering U.S. cybersecurity, after repeated failed attempts to pass legislation through Congress. Anonymous has reached a verdict of NO CONFIDENCE in this executive order and the plans to reintroduce the CISPA bill to Congress on the same day. As such, President Obama and the State of the Union Address will be BANISHED from the Internet for the duration of live delivery. So as not to infringe upon the President’s free speech, subsequent broadcasts will be allowed to pass unhindered. This action is being taken to underline a fact that appears to be sorely unrecognized by the Obama Administration — that the Internet is a sovereign territory, and does not fall under the jurisdiction of any nation state. We are the natives of this space, and its guardians, and we will fight until death to protect it as a neutral grounds for the unhindered interaction of all members of the human race, so long as they themselves act in harmony with this inviolable principle. Our determination is that President Obama is acting in direct contravention of this principle, and his brief exclusion is an educational, rather than a punitive measure. We hope that its lesson will be learnt. Punitive measures have not been ruled out. — Anonymous END COMMUNIQUE ||||| Anonymous has made a grand claim ahead of Tuesday night's State of the Union address. In a communiqué posted on AnonRelations.net and spread through Anonymous' social media channels, the hacker collective announced it \\"will form a virtual blockade between Capitol Hill and the Internet\\" such that \\"there will be no State of the Union Address on the web tonight.\\" What exactly Anonymous has in store for this evening is not detailed in the communiqué, nor is it clear whether hackers could indeed disrupt the feeds screening President Obama's speech online. However, the communiqué took the opportunity to decry the president for some of the worst civil liberties and privacy abuses perpetuated by his administration and to renew the hackers' tribute to the late Aaron Swartz. The message reads: Tonight, the President of the United States will appear before a joint session of Congress to deliver the State of the Union Address and tomorrow he plans to sign an executive order for cyber-security as the House Intelligence committee reintroduces the defeated CISPA act which turns private companies into government informants. He will not be covering the NDAA, an act of outright tyrannical legislation allowing for indefinite detention of citizens completely outside due process and the rule of law. In fact, lawyers for the government have point-blank refused to state whether or not journalists who cover stories or groups the Government disfavors would be subject to this detention. He will not be covering the extra-judicial and unregulated justifications for targeted killings of citizens by military drones within the borders of America, or the fact that Orwellian newspeak had to be used to make words like “imminent” mean their opposite. He will not be covering Bradley Manning, 1000 days in detention with no trial for revealing military murders, told that his motive for leaking cannot be taken into consideration, that the Government does not have room for conscience. He will not be covering the secret interpretations of law that allow for warrant-less wiretapping and surveillance of any US citizen without probably cause of criminal acts, or the use of Catch-22 logic where no-one can complain about being snooped on because the state won’t tell you who they’re snooping on, and if you don’t know you’re being snooped on, you don’t have a right to complain. We reject the State of the Union. In a separate communiqué emailed out and picked up by activist publicity group the Sparrow Project, Anonymous again announced plans to disrupt SOTU online. In this email, however, Anonymous note that they plan to allow \\"subsequent [SOTU] broadcasts will be allowed to pass unhindered\\" after the live speech has concluded, \\"So as not to infringe upon the President’s free speech.\\" The statement adds: \\"This action is being taken to underline a fact that appears to be sorely unrecognized by the Obama Administration — that the Internet is a sovereign territory, and does not fall under the jurisdiction of any nation state.\\" What precise interventions Anonymous can make during the address remains to be seen, but at this point #OpSOTU, as it is named, is a playful rallying cry to challenge abuses of executive power. The communiqué closes, \\"For freedom, for Aaron Swartz, for the Internet, and of course, for the lulz.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A group of hackers, called Anonymous, is planning to try and stop the President's State of the Union Address from being shown on the internet.

Since my son was home schooling, he went with me to the church every day. Most mornings, we'd stop at a local store, and get a chocolate drink for him and a cup of coffee for me. The clerk at the store made our lives more enjoyable each day, and so we returned again and again. She had found her own way of enjoying life and her job. I'm not even sure if she realized that her warmth and brightness put a smile upon the face of each customer . When a customer brought cakes to the counter, any other clerk could have asked: \\"Would you like some milk with those cakes?\\" Instead, she asked: \\"Would you like a lottery ticket with those cakes?\\" She might have asked me if I wanted sugar with my coffee. But instead, she asked: \\"Would you like some batteries with that coffee?\\" Yes, life is what you make of it. This clerk's method of dealing with what some think is a boring job, and with the customers she met daily, made the hours in her day more enjoyable. In doing that, she also refreshed the lives of others and made them laugh. Sometimes, if my day at the church had been very tiring, we'd stop at that store before going home. We'd giggle as we left the store, the clerk's words echoing behind us. \\"Would you like some shampoo with that orange juice?\\" The answer is:","completion":"Based on the given article, which of the following statements best describes the store clerk's approach to her job and interactions with customers?

C) The clerk would strictly follow the store's standard procedures and never deviate from them. D) The clerk would repeatedly ask customers about lotteries and other promotional offers.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the court that exiled people? , can you please find it? Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and child, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of a trusty slave was Themistocles's Persian slave Sicinnus (the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest (δίκη βλάβης / dikē blabēs). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen (γραφὴ ὕβρεως / graphē hybreōs); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess (ὕβρις / hubris).Isocrates claimed that \\"not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial\\"; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: \\"was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?\\" The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a δίκη φονική (dikē phonikē), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood. In the 4th century BC, the suspect was judged by the Palladion, a court... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The court that exiled people in ancient Athens was called the Palladion. This court dealt with various matters, including cases related to the murder or mistreatment of slaves, and it had the authority to exile individuals as a form of punishment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Aquino III’s hand in advancing his political agenda, according to early unofficial election returns on Tuesday that showed his political allies poised to take control of the Senate. Mr. Aquino was not up for re-election in the vote on Monday. He has three years remaining in his six-year term and is not permitted to run again. But the midterm election was seen as crucial for consolidating his power over the unwieldy Philippine legislature to advance his anticorruption and economic-growth program and to influence the choice of his successor. The Philippines is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, and international organizations and ratings agencies have credited Mr. Aquino’s policies for that success. “This victory in the Senate means he will not be a lame-duck president,” said Ramon C. Casiple, the executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform in Manila. “He can use his popularity and control of the government to pursue his agenda and affect the 2016 presidential election.” At stake in the election on Monday were 12 of the 24 Senate seats and all 229 seats in the House of Representatives. The election also covered 18,000 local political posts, including provincial governors. With 69 percent of the vote counted, nine pro-administration Senate candidates were ahead. Their victory would increase the number of Mr. Aquino’s allies in the chamber to 13 from 4 and give them the power to choose the next Senate president. Final Senate results were expected by late Wednesday. Mr. Aquino’s political opponents have noted that although the economy has expanded, job growth has been flat and poverty levels have not improved. His critics also say corruption remains endemic, particularly low-level graft that most directly affects the poor. In campaign rallies for his political allies, Mr. Aquino responded that in his remaining three years in office, his government would focus on extending the benefits of economic prosperity to the country’s poor and on continuing to crack down on corruption. The shift in power in the Senate would give Mr. Aquino extraordinary control over the government, Mr. Casiple said. His allies’ gains in the Senate would be complemented by the traditional control that the administration has over the House of Representatives. Though the results of many races were still unclear on Tuesday, party alliances are less significant in the House, Mr. Casiple said. House members rely on national government money to finance projects in their districts, giving the administration considerable leverage over the body. In addition to his expected control of both houses of Congress, Mr. Aquino is seen as having significant influence over the judiciary. Last year, he led a successful effort to remove the chief justice of the Supreme Court for his failure to disclose assets, which allowed the president to appoint the current leader of the court. Other notable election results included the fiercely contested mayor’s race in Manila, where former President Joseph Estrada ousted the incumbent, Alfredo S. Lim. Mr. Estrada, a former action movie star who was removed from the presidency after being accused of corruption, remains a popular political figure. Imelda R. Marcos, the former first lady, appeared headed for re-election to the House of Representatives. Her daughter Imee Marcos was re-elected governor of Ilocos Norte Province, the birthplace of her father, Ferdinand E. Marcos, the former president who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989. Former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, despite remaining in detention in a government hospital on corruption charges, appeared set for a landslide re-election as the Congressional representative in her home district of Pampanga. The election on Monday saw less violence and fewer delays than in years past. The police reported at least seven election-related deaths, all of which occurred in the country’s restive south.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What carried meaning for Victoria? Context: His birthday (14 December 1895) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Prince Albert, the Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \\"rather distressed\\". Two days later, he wrote again: \\"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\\". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \\"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\\". Consequently, he was baptised \\"Albert Frederick Arthur George\\" at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as \\"Bertie\\". His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name \\"may supplant the less favoured one\\".

Please answer the following question: Process: - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose during fermentation happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The human body requires a continuous supply of oxygen to maintain the health and function of our cells and tissues. When we breathe in, we inhale oxygen which then travels into our lungs and is transported by red blood cells to our tissues. However, perturbations such as the presence of fermentation might affect the amount of oxygen reaching the body. To assess the effect of this perturbation, it is essential to understand the relationship between the primary process (breathing) and the hypothesized perturbation (fermentation). Fermentation is a metabolic process that occurs in some microorganisms, such as yeast and bacteria, as well as in human cells under certain conditions. It involves the conversion of glucose and other sugars to generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) without the need for oxygen. There are two main types of fermentation: alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. In alcoholic fermentation, glucose is converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide, whereas, in lactic acid fermentation, glucose is converted to lactate. Now, let's evaluate the possible interactions between the respiratory process and the presence of fermentation in our initial scenario: 1. In the case of fermentation happening within human cells, it might occur under anaerobic conditions, which means the cells have an insufficient oxygen supply. It is important to note that anaerobic respiration or fermentation is considerably less efficient than aerobic respiration in generating ATP. This situation could arise due to decreased blood flow or impaired lung function, which prevents adequate oxygen transportation. As a result, the body would experience a reduced energy supply, potentially leading to fatigue and other symptoms. This example highlights an indirect effect of fermentation on the breathing process as it is caused by an underlying condition that affects oxygen supply rather than fermentation directly impacting oxygenation. 2. Fermentation involving microorganisms in the human body could potentially compete with human cells for oxygen, leading to limited oxygen availability. This situation might occur during severe infections when the microbial population grows rapidly and consumes significant amounts of oxygen, leaving less for human cells to utilize. In this case, the perturbation would have a direct effect on the breathing process by hampering the body's ability to efficiently use oxygen. Considering both scenarios mentioned above, it can be concluded that the presence of fermentation can indeed have an effect (both direct and indirect) on oxygen transportation and utilization in the human body. If fermentation reduces the availability or consumption of oxygen, it could lead to an overall decrease in the efficiency of the body's metabolic processes, impacting energy production and overall health. The degree of this effect would depend on the extent and duration of the perturbation caused by fermentation and the body's ability to compensate for any oxygen deficiencies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She was commissioned to the Royal Navy and took over as HMS \`\` Tattoo '' on 26 October 1943 .","completion":"Yes, the two sentences can be considered as paraphrasing each other. Paraphrasing means that the same information or message is conveyed using different words or structure, while maintaining the original meaning. In the first sentence, \\"She was commissioned to the Royal Navy and transferred as HMS 'Tattoo' on 26 October 1943,\\" the term \\"transferred\\" is used which indicates that the control or ownership of the entity being referred to as 'she' (probably a ship given the mention of Royal Navy and HMS Tattoo) was passed on or changed. In the second sentence, \\"She was commissioned to the Royal Navy and took over as HMS 'Tattoo' on 26 October 1943,\\" the term 'took over' is used to express a similar concept as 'transferred as', in this context, conveying the idea that 'she' (assuming it to be a ship), started to be known or operated as HMS Tattoo starting from that date. In both sentences, the entity being referred to as 'she' is commissioned to the Royal Navy and becomes HMS 'Tattoo' on the same date, i.e., 26 October 1943. Thus, the essence or core information of the two sentences remains the same, with slight variations in structure and choice of words, thereby making them paraphrases of each other. To paraphrase effectively, one usually changes the sentence structure, shifts the voice from active to passive or vice-versa, uses synonyms or explains terminology. The exchanged use of words \\"transferred\\" and \\"took over\\" can be seen as the application of using synonyms while paraphrasing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You are given a new situation: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't. and a hint : Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Please answer this question : Which country will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information and the concept of distance decay, it can be inferred that Niger will likely be more developed as a consequence of their political and economic agendas. Firstly, let's break down the agendas followed by each country: - Niger focused on developing its infrastructure and communications technology. Infrastructure generally includes transportation systems, public services, and utilities, while communications technology encompasses advancements such as telephones, broadcasting, and the internet. - Nigeria, in contrast, did not prioritize infrastructure and communications technology in their agenda. As a result, they may have fallen behind in terms of connectivity, resource distribution, and access to economic opportunities. Now, considering the concept of distance decay and its influence on the development of these countries, we can analyze some potential consequences of their respective agendas: 1. Connectivity: Niger's investment in infrastructure and communication technology enhances its ability to create and maintain cultural, social, and economic ties not only within the country but also beyond its borders. This accessibility to global markets can support its economy and improve the overall standard of living for its citizens. 2. Economic Growth: By prioritizing infrastructure and communication technology, Niger has created an environment that supports innovation and facilitates the flow of capital, labor, and resources, all of which contribute to economic growth. Improved infrastructure also attracts foreign direct investments, thus creating more job opportunities and boosting the country's economy. 3. Social Development: Improved communication technology fosters better access to information and knowledge, which can translate into benefits such as better healthcare, enhanced educational opportunities, and higher employment rates. These factors ultimately contribute to the social development of a nation. 4. Resilience to Distance Decay: Niger's focus on infrastructure and communication technology can mitigate the negative effects of distance decay. This is because faster travel and advancements in technology reduce the impact of distance on cultural, social, and economic interactions. In contrast, Nigeria's lack of investment in infrastructure and communication technology could hinder its development by limiting connections, impeding economic growth, slowing social development, and being more susceptible to the effects of distance decay. Therefore, as a consequence of their respective agendas, Niger would likely emerge as the more developed country. This is primarily due to its strategic focus on infrastructure and communications technology, which foster a stable economy, social development, and stronger resilience against the detrimental effects of distance decay."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Come with me, if you will, back to 2009: the ninth year of the third millennium and the year Owl City released its hit song “Fireflies.” “Fireflies” eventually reached the No. 1 slot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, in part because it presented the world with a new scientific conundrum: can fireflies hug? Here’s the lyric that started it: “Cause I'd get a thousand hugs / From ten thousand lightning bugs / As they tried to teach me how to dance.” Yesterday, Owl City’s Adam Young attempted to explain his lyrics, in response to a fan who asked on Twitter, “Does each firefly hug you 1,000 times or do only 1/10th of the bugs give you a hug?” Young gives us a lot to unpack here, so in the words of Lily Tomlin on the set of I Heart Huckabees, “Let’s just take it one fucking line at a time.” “I was the recipient of 1,000 hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs for a grand total of 10,000,000 hugs.” So what you’re saying is that each firefly hugged you 1,000 times. Got it. “As the lyrics of the song clearly state, the average layperson would not believe their eyes if 10,000,000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth, nor would the average person conclude by natural instinct that 10,000 lightning bugs, acting as a collective group, are capable of embracing a human being 1,000 times without difficulty.” First off, there are around 2,000 species of firefly, according to National Geographic, and some adult fireflies do not light up at all, according to Scientific American. The Photinus pyralis is the most common species in North America, and since West is from Minnesota, let’s assume we’re talking about that. In a 1928 study titled “The Brightness of the Light of the West Indian Elaterid Beetle, Pyrophorus,” researchers E. Newton Harvey and Kenneth P. Stevens conclude that although the brightness of these “headlight bugs” varied greatly among individuals, the average brightness of a single beetle was around 0.0006 lumens of light. From there, we can assume that 10 million fireflies, if producing a similar amount of light as the West Indian elaterid beetle, would produce around 6,000 lumens of light. According to the FTC, a standard 60-watt incandescent lightbulb produces around 800 lumens, which means that 10 million fireflies might produce the same amount of light as 7.5 lightbulbs. Adam my boy, we’ve already gone off the rails here, and YET, in the second half of this thought you move even deeper into nonsense territory when you say that the lightning bugs act as a “collective group.” This throws into dispute your earlier insistence that you received 10 million hugs. Instead, a collective hug suggests you were hugged 1,000 times by a single firefly group, and not individually by each firefly. “By the same token, a gathering of lightning bugs in such vast numbers form a sort of “swarm,” and a swarm can collectively surround a human and deliver a “hug” that a single firefly, acting according to the dictates of his own conscience, simply cannot.” Again, if the swarm is delivering the hug, and a single firefly cannot act alone, then Adam Young did not receive 10 million hugs, he received 1,000. Young probably wasn’t hugged at all, says Douglas Yanega, the senior museum scientist of the Entomology Research Museum at the University of California, Riverside. “You can be surrounded by fireflies if you are in a habitat that is full of snails, but they will not make physical contact with you in great numbers,” Yanega wrote in an email to The Verge. “Any ‘mass hugs’ are therefore purely metaphorical, like being hugged or kissed by a cloud of butterflies. It's a poetic metaphor, yes, but not a literal reality.” In this section Young also makes the interesting decision to enter a debate about the nature of consciousness. In 2016, two professors at Macquarie University in Australia theorized that insects have “midbrain-like structures,” where it is thought that human consciousness also exists. One of the professors, Colin Klein, said that insects “plan, but don’t imagine,” according to Smithsonian Magazine. What Young seems to be arguing is that a firefly is incapable of planning as an individual being, or perhaps experiences fear when confronted the possibility of performing a hug on its own. He does not back up his theories. “This may seem inconceivable due to the firefly’s soft-shelled body, which is common among all winged beetles within the Lampyridae insect family.” True. “Members of the scientific community may be tempted to cast doubt upon the possibility of this exchange due to the immobility of the prothorax and pterothorax, in addition to the elytra protruding outward while a firefly is engaged in mid-flight. However, I can testify to the accuracy of this exchange.” It seems strange to me that the man arguing in favor of firefly hugs would point out that their bodies may not be equipped for hugging. It serves no purpose in his overall argument, and instead appears to be an attempt to divert readers’ attention. “I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place, each firefly participated in the chemical reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly, in the presence of oxygen, magnesium ions, and ATP, emitted a chemically produced light or “glow” because they were happy to be hugging me.” “The only species of fireflies known to synchronize flashing usually do it while resting on vegetation,” says Yanega, our new entomologist friend. Only one species that he knows of does this in the US, in the Great Smoky Mountains, which are not in Minnesota. Even this species doesn’t synchronize very accurately — and they definitely don't do it while airborne. \\"Think of ‘The Wave’ being done in a sports arena, using cigarette lighters,\\" Yanega says. Even then, they still flash on and off, rather than remaining permanently on. Additionally, we seem to have once again found ourselves circling the issue of insect consciousness. Here, Young asks us to further suspend our disbelief and accept that not only can fireflies experience happiness, but they can experience happiness from hugging him. “Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions! Stream “Fireflies” on Apple Music and Spotify!” I’ve reached out to Owl City’s management company and will update if I hear back. And I did listen to “Fireflies” on Spotify, in preparation for this evaluation. The song still makes no sense. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| In a Facebook post that's gone viral, Young said that he was \\"the recipient of 1,000 hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs for a grand total of 10,000,000 hugs.\\" \\"As the lyrics of the song clearly state, the average layperson would not believe their eyes if 10,000,000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth, nor would the average person conclude by natural instinct that 10,000 lightning bugs, acting as a collective group, are capable of embracing a human being 1,000 times without difficulty,\\" he said. \\"By the same token, a gathering of lightning bugs in such vast numbers form a sort of 'swarm,'\\" the singer further clarified. \\"And a swarm can collectively surround a human and deliver a 'hug' that a single firefly, acting according to the dictates of his own conscience, simply cannot.\\" Young acknowledged that this \\"may seem inconceivable due to the firefly’s soft-shelled body, which is common among all winged beetles within the Lampyridae insect family,\\" but that he \\"can testify to the accuracy of this exchange.\\" \\"I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place, each firefly participated in the chemical reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly, in the presence of oxygen, magnesium ions and ATP, emitted a chemically produced light or 'glow' because they were happy to be hugging me,\\" Young concluded, along with a reminder to stream the song on Apple Music and Spotify. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Owl City's hit song \\"Fireflies\\" sparked a debate over whether fireflies can hug, based on the lyrics \\"Cause I'd get a thousand hugs / From ten thousand lightning bugs / As they tried to teach me how to dance.\\" Adam Young, the artist behind Owl City, attempted to explain his lyrics, suggesting that fireflies can collectively hug a person.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. once the content has been removed and google has noted the update, the information will no longer appear in google's search results. Make this proper case","completion":"Once the content has been removed and Google has noted the update, the information will no longer appear in Google's search results. When a piece of information or content is deleted from a website, it takes some time for Google to recognize the change and update its search results accordingly. This process involves Google's web crawlers re-indexing the updated web page, and removing the deleted information from Google's search index. The process generally unfolds as follows: 1. Content Removal: The first step is to remove the unwanted content from the source website. This can be done by the website owner or administrator. If the content is hosted on a third-party platform, such as a blog or forum, contacting the platform administrators to request removal may be necessary. 2. Cache Clearing: Websites typically have a cache where temporary copies of pages are stored. It's important to clear the cache to ensure that the deleted content does not reappear in search results. Most content management systems (CMS) have built-in cache clearing functions, while website owners using custom-built websites may need to manually clear the cache. 3. Request Indexing in Google Search Console: Once the content has been removed and the cache has been cleared, it's essential to submit a request to Google for re-indexing the updated web page. This can be done using the URL Inspection tool in Google Search Console. Input the updated URL, click the \\"Request indexing\\" button, and wait for Google to crawl and index the page. 4. Google's Web Crawlers: Google uses automated web crawlers (also known as \\"bots\\" or \\"spiders\\") to scan and index web pages. When a request for indexing is submitted, Google's web crawlers visit the updated web page and collect information about its content, structure, and links. This process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending on the complexity of the website and the number of pages to be indexed. 5. Updating the Search Index: After Google's web crawlers have completed their task, the search index is updated to reflect the changes made to the web page. The deleted content will no longer appear in search results. However, it's essential to note that variations in search rankings and appearance may occur during the transition period. 6. Monitoring the Results: Finally, closely monitor Google's search results to ensure that the deleted content remains absent. This entails regularly searching relevant keywords and phrases, and checking for the presence of the removed content. If the content reappears, it may be necessary to repeat the process or consult with a web professional to address more complex issues. By following these steps, you can ensure that once content has been removed and Google has noted the update, the information will no longer appear in Google's search results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The lulling sound of the creek, the quiet rustling of the leaves, and the gentle tug of fish nibbling at their bait was an escape for Christopher, Danny, Olivia, and Melissa. While they bonded over their shared love for the sport, Adam found himself drawn to other pursuits. Adam was always more fascinated by technology and learning about the rapid advancements that kept him busy reading various articles on the subject. The mechanical world and its marvels were what piqued his interest. From gadgets and gizmos to the intricacies of computer programming, he was a whiz when it came to anything with a chip. It wasn't that Christopher and his friends didn't appreciate Adam's different hobbies; they just couldn't share the same excitement over an updated phone model or the newest software. Christopher would often invite Adam on their fishing trips in a bid to include him in their camaraderie. However, Adam would politely decline, already knee-deep in a coding project or researching the next big thing in technology. At one point, Melissa suggested that they make their usual weekend trips more interactive and engaging so that Adam might be more inclined to join. So, using Adam's expertise, they attempted to merge his passions with their love for fishing. The group decided to incorporate more tech-focused activities during their fishing trips, such as using a drone to map out their favorite fishing spots or experimenting with underwater cameras to peek at the fish they hoped to catch. They even tried their hand at building a remote-controlled bait dispenser, which would allow them to release the bait more efficiently. During these technology-infused fishing trips, Adam started to discover the allure of nature and seeing the excitement his friends had during their fishing adventures. In turn, Christopher, Danny, Olivia, and Melissa started to appreciate the thrill of invention and the fascinating fun that mastering new technology brought to the table. As time passed, the group began to bond over a shared appreciation for one another's passions. Their fishing trips turned into an amalgamation of old-fashioned pastimes mixed with modern tech marvels. These adventures became a source of enjoyment, learning, and collaboration, as they always aimed to invent and create new ways to make their fishing excursions even more exciting. Adam soon found himself enjoying every element of his friends' hobby - from the competitive spirit of trying to catch the biggest fish to the meditative calm of spending time surrounded by nature. Christopher and his friends were likewise thrilled with the ways technology could enhance their experience, opening their eyes to new possibilities and opportunities for their favorite pastime. Ultimately, the group's friendships deepened as they continued to share and exchange their experiences in their respective interests.

Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a \\"must-play\\" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's \\"Weekend\\" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the \\"New York Underground\\" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound.

Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance.

It is a direct action implying the use of glue, tape, or pins. 2. \\"Stick some feathers in the turkey before you serve it.\\" In this sentence, \\"stick\\" is used to mean insert or push something (feathers) into something else (the turkey).

(AP) — An attorney for a woman who says Roy Moore assaulted her when she was a 16-year-old waitress says a handwriting expert has confirmed that his inscription in her 1977 yearbook is authentic. Moore's campaign says the accuser's admission that she added the time and place of Moore's yearbook inscription in her own handwriting undermines her entire story. Beverly Nelson's high school yearbook has become key evidence supporting her claim that the 34-year-old prosecutor was a regular at the Olde Hickory House restaurant where she worked as a teenager — and where she says he attacked her in his car after she accepted his offer of a ride home one cold winter night. Moore has denied knowing Nelson, or the restaurant in Gadsden, for that matter. With just days to go before Tuesday's voting in Moore's Senate race against Democrat Doug Jones, his campaign has been roiled by this and other accusations of sexual misconduct decades ago. Moore has aggressively sought to discredit his accusers, suggesting that both establishment Republicans and liberals are behind the claims. Moore has posted on Twitter frequently about the yearbook, calling his signature a forgery. The inscription reads, \\"To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, 'Merry Christmas.'\\" It is followed by the signature \\"Roy Moore D.A.\\" and the notation \\"12-22-77 Olde Hickory House.\\" Gloria Allred said Friday that a hired handwriting expert found the signature to be authentic. \\"We think it's important evidence that supports Beverly's statements that Roy Moore asked to sign her yearbook when she was just 16 years old. And it demonstrates that when Roy Moore stated, quote, 'I do not know any of these women,' end quote, that statement does not appear to be true,\\" Allred said. Allred acknowledged that Nelson added the date and restaurant name below the signature. Moore's attorney Phillip Jauregui said Friday that this admission undermines the credibility of Nelson's account and shows that they weren't telling the truth at an initial press conference. \\"What they said then was either a lie or what they said today was a lie. The voters are going to have to decide, were they lying then, or are they lying now?\\" Jauregui said. He asked Allred to release the yearbook so an independent expert can evaluate the signature and notation. \\"Until they release the yearbook, all we know is, they're not telling the truth and they've lied,\\" he said. At a rally Friday night in Pensacola, Florida, President Donald Trump taunted Nelson. \\"Did you see what happened today? You know, the yearbook? Did you see that? There was a little mistake made,\\" Trump said, shifting to a sing-songy voice. \\"She started writing things in the yearbook.\\" Trump had reinforced his support for Moore earlier Friday by tweeting a similar message. ||||| Beverly Nelson, who accuses Moore of assaulting her when she was 16, made annotations on the message Moore, then 32, allegedly wrote in her 1977 yearbook Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has branded one of his accusers a liar, after she admitted adding notes to a crucial piece of evidence. Steve Bannon champions Roy Moore and attacks Mitt Romney for not serving in military Read more Moore faces – and denies – multiple accusations of sexual misconduct towards teenage girls decades ago, including one involving a 14-year-old. Beverly Young Nelson was 16 when, she alleges, Moore groped her and tried to force her into a sex act in his car. Nelson has offered as evidence a 1977 high school yearbook that she says was signed by Moore. The inscription reads: “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, DA. 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House.” Olde Hickory House was the restaurant in Gadsden, Alabama, where Nelson worked when Moore, in his 30s at the time, allegedly assaulted her. The entire note was initially implied to have been written by Moore, which he denied. Nelson acknowledged on Friday that the date and location annotations were hers. “He did sign it,” she told ABC News. When interviewer Tom Llamasput put to her, “And you made some notes underneath,” Nelson replied: “Yes.” In a Friday afternoon press conference in Atlanta, the attorney Gloria Allred announced that the inscription and signature had been analysed by Arthur Anthony, a forensic document expert. In his report, which Allred presented to reporters, Anthony concluded that the note and signature belonged to Moore. “The expert’s opinion is important [and] we hope that the voters of Alabama will take into consideration when they vote next Tuesday,” Allred said. “We look forward to learning if Alabama voters will believe Roy Moore’s accusers or if they will ignore the evidence presented to them and instead elect a man who denies the allegations against him and who attacks those who dare to tell what they say is the truth about Roy Moore.” We look forward to learning if Alabama voters will believe Roy Moore’s accusers or if they will ignore the evidence Gloria Allred, Nelson's lawyer Allred brushed off claims from Moore supporters that Nelson’s admission undermined the authenticity of the yearbook entry. “It is also a defamatory statement to accuse her of a crime,” Allred said. “So I would say that anyone who accuses her of a crime or me should proceed at their own risk and their own peril. And I would say such risk and such peril are significant under the circumstances.” Nelson showed reporters the yearbook, turning to the page where she says Moore signed it. She also pointed to a photo of Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, who Nelson said was in her class in high school. “I am a Republican who supported Mr Trump for president,” Nelson said. “I did so because I thought that he cared about people like me. I am very disappointed that I was wrong. “President Trump has chosen to support a powerful politician like Mr Moore over women like me who accuse Roy Moore of preying on them when they were in their teens.” But the issue of the yearbook annotations was seized on by Moore. “Now she herself admits to lying,” read part of a tweet from his account. “Let’s count how many national outlets will ignore the fact that she admits to lying.” At a press conference in Montgomery, lawyer Phillip Jauregui said that in her first media appearance with Nelson, Allred had claimed “with her client … nodding in agreement, that everything written on that page was written by Judge Moore. Well, today it’s a different story, isn’t it? They’re not saying that any more. They’re saying that parts of it were not written by Judge Moore. “We suspected it back then and we demanded that they turn over the yearbook so that we could test the ink, test the writing and test everything. We renew that demand today: release the yearbook so that an independent expert – not your paid expert – an independent expert, a neutral third-party custodian can take it and look at the ink so we can find out: is the ink a month old or is it 40 years old?” Jauregui added: “The truth is out there and until she releases the yearbook all we know is they’re not telling the truth and they’ve lied.” He left the room with taking questions. Moore was endorsed by Trump last weekend and is running ahead of Democrat Doug Jones in the polls ahead of Tuesday’s election. Trump tweeted on Friday: “LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He’s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns & Military. VOTE ROY MOORE!” In her ABC interview, Nelson said: “Is the party more important really than what happened? I feel like my incident is being swept under the rug, literally, because he’s a Republican.” Nelson, who went public after the Washington Post reported on allegations made by four women, added: “It sickens me to wonder what may go on with him if he gets into office.” She said Moore offered her a ride home after work but instead parked the car and tried to assault her. He told her not tell anyone about the alleged incident, she said. “He could be doing this still,” Nelson added. “We don’t know. And, then again, I hope that he’s changed. I pray that he’s changed. I really do.” Moore has been embroiled in fresh controversy over comments he made at a rally in September. Asked by an African American member of the audience when he thought America was great, the former judge reportedly answered: “I think it was great at the time when families were united – even though we had slavery – they cared for one another. Our families were strong, our country had a direction.” The president was set to hold a Friday night rally in Pensacola, Florida, near the Alabama border. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A lady named Beverly Young Nelson said that a man named Roy Moore, who wants to be a senator, was not nice to her when she was 16 years old.

Washington (CNN) -- The United States has lifted its ban on U.S. carriers flying to and from Tel Aviv, Israel. The Federal Aviation Administration's move came Wednesday night, a day and a half after it imposed the prohibition over security concerns amid renewed Mideast violence. Airlines moved quickly to restore service. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways said Thursday they are resuming flights to Israel's busiest airport, Ben Gurion International. The European Aviation Safety Agency also has reversed its recommendation that airlines avoid flying to Ben Gurion.

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania.

Movie plot title: Shutter Island Movie plot: In 1954, two U.S. Marshals â Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule â travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \\"The law of 4; who is 67?\\" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days. Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist. In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case. During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns Daniels that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized.

Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Question: Who is killed by Armstrong and the farmer's wife? Movie plot title: Torn Curtain Movie plot: Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman), an esteemed American physicist and rocket scientist, is to attend a scientific conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. He takes a cruise ship to Copenhagen along with his assistant and fiancée, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews). Armstrong tells Sherman that he did not want her to come along, and en route to Copenhagen, he receives a radiogram to pick up a book once in Copenhagen. The book, allegedly a first-edition of one of Armstrong's book, actually contains a message that says, \\"Contact in case (of emergency.)\\" He tells Sherman he is going to Stockholm, but she discovers he is flying to East Berlin, and she follows him there. When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government, and Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected to the other side. Sherman, however, is extremely uncomfortable with this move, realizing if the apparent defection is in fact real, given the circumstances of the Cold War of the period, she would likely never see her home or family again. They are constantly accompanied by Professor Karl Manfred (Günter Strack), who took part in arranging Armstrong's defection to the East.Armstrong visits a contact, a 'farmer' (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment in order to learn just how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. While Armstrong does not inform the U.S. government of his plan, he has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as (Pi).However, Armstrong is followed to this farm by his official body man, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer assigned to him. Gromek realizes what is and that Armstrong is a double agent, and as Gromek is calling the police to report his suspicions, a tortuous and violent fight scene commences that ends with Gromek being killed. So as to not arouse the suspicion of...","completion":"The question seems to refer to a character's death in the movie titled 'Torn Curtain'. According to the plot detailed here, the character who is killed by Armstrong and the farmer's wife is Hermann Gromek. Hermann Gromek (portrayed by Wolfgang Kieling) is an East German security officer assigned to the protagonist, Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman). Armstrong, functioning as a double agent, is followed to a farm by Gromek. There, Gromek correctly deduces that Armstrong is a double agent and attempts to report this information to the police. However, before he is able to fully reveal Armstrong's true allegiance, a violent fight ensures that results in Gromek's death. Thus, it can be confirmed that Hermann Gromek is the character who was killed by Michael Armstrong and the 'farmer’s wife', whose real identity isn't explicitly provided in the plot, in the movie 'Torn Curtain'. Armstrong's motives for this murder would have been to protect his secret mission of gaining intelligence regarding the progress made by the East German scientific establishment—and more broadly, the Soviet Union—on anti-missile systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Turkish is a prominent language spoken mainly in Turkey and Cyprus, as well as by diaspora communities in various countries. It belongs to the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family and, like other Turkic languages, has agglutinative grammar, which means words are formed by adding various suffixes to word stems. The Turkish language, also known as Türkçe, adopts the Latin alphabet with a few modifications due to specific letters representing distinctive phonemes (speech sounds). Turkey made this shift from Arabic to the Latin alphabet in 1928 during the language reform that occurred after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. The phrase \\"Harekete geç\\" can be translated as \\"Get moving\\" or \\"Take action\\" in English. It is a phrase often used to encourage someone to start something, whether it's initiating a project or beginning a journey. Turkish language history dates back to the Old Turkic or Gokturk script from the 8th century. Over time, it evolved through classic, middle, and new periods. The language's development was heavily influenced by interactions with various civilizations that ruled Anatolia, which is modern-day Turkey. Influences from different languages such as Arabic, Persian, and French contributed to Turkish vocabulary and its grammatical structure. As the Ottoman Empire expanded, the Ottoman Turkish language became a blend of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic features. Later on, the language reform led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk promoted the use of Turkish while replacing many loanwords with more native equivalents. Turkish is a phonetic language, which means each letter in the alphabet represents a specific sound. This feature provides consistency to pronunciation rules, and consequently, it's relatively straightforward for learners to read and pronounce Turkish words correctly. However, the grammar and complex sentence structures could pose challenges to non-native speakers. In terms of linguistic relations, Turkish is closely related to Turkmen, Azerbaijani, and Uzbek, but it is also distantly related to other Turkic languages like Kazakh and Kyrgyz. While most native Turkish speakers reside in Turkey, there's a growing diaspora population in countries like Germany, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. In conclusion, \\"Harekete geç\\" is in Turkish, which is a Turkic language predominantly spoken in Turkey and Cyprus. The language has a rich history, influenced by various cultures and linguistic developments, and is closely related to several other Turkic languages. With Turkey's progressing role in regional and global affairs, Turkish has become an important language with increasing influence in Europe, Asia, and North Africa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a more detailed and long answer: Hair color among Greeks has been a subject of interest for many researchers and is influenced by various genetic factors, including the interplay between multiple genes and gene-environment interactions. The distribution of hair color in Greece is not homogeneous across the country, with regional differences observed due to historical population movements and local environmental factors. Traditionally, Greeks have been categorized under the broader Mediterranean or Southern European group, sharing many phenotype traits with their neighbors, including Italians, Spaniards, and Portuguese. The predominant hair color among Greeks and Mediterranean people, in general, is dark brown to black, with an estimated prevalence of around 60-70%. Furthermore, light brown hair color has been observed in approximately 20-30% of the population, with the remaining population exhibiting light hair colors such as blonde or light ash brown. Notably, a noticeable proportion of Greeks, especially those from certain regions, exhibit lighter hair shades. For instance, the population of the Epirus region in Northwestern Greece and those residing in certain Aegean Islands demonstrate a higher prevalence of light hair colors, likely due to historical mixing with populations from Northern Europe and the Balkans. In line with these observations, a study published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology aimed to analyze the pigmentation phenotype of contemporary Greeks using objective measurements and found that light hair shades were not uncommon among Greeks, particularly among the younger generation. The study also revealed a gradient of hair color distribution with lighter hair more prevalent in participants from Northwestern Greece. In conclusion, the dominant hair color believed to be prevalent among Greeks is dark brown to black. However, regional differences and a significant percentage of individuals with lighter hair colors cannot be disregarded. To gain a more complete understanding of hair color prevalence in Greece, broader studies covering different geographic locations and diverse age groups are necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Between 1987 and 2015, with a gap in 2010-12, he represented four constituencies as a Member of Parliament, elected as a candidate for the Labour Party and later the Respect Party. After becoming the youngest ever Chairman of the Scottish Labour Party in 1981, he became General Secretary of the London-based charity War on Want in 1983, remaining in the post until elected as MP for Glasgow Hillhead (later Glasgow Kelvin) at the 1987 general election. In 2003, Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party, having been found guilty by the party's national constitutional committee of four of the five charges of bringing the party into disrepute, including having called on Arabs to fight British troops. Context: In 1998, Galloway founded the Mariam Appeal which was intended, according to its website's welcome page in 1999, \\"to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq\\". The campaign was named after Mariam Hamza, a child flown by the fund from Iraq to Britain to receive treatment for leukaemia. The intention was to raise awareness of the suffering and death of hundreds of thousands of other Iraqi children, due to poor health conditions and lack of suitable medicines and facilities, and to campaign for the lifting of the Iraq sanctions that many maintained were responsible for that situation. In 1999, Galloway was criticised for spending Christmas in Iraq with Tariq Aziz, who was Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister at the time. In a 17 May 2005 hearing of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Galloway stated that he had many meetings with Aziz, and characterised their relationship as friendly. In all, he has admitted to more than ten meetings with Aziz. The fund received scrutiny during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, after a complaint that Galloway used some donated money to pay for his travel expenses. He responded by stating that the expenses were incurred in his capacity as the Appeal's chairman. Although the Mariam Appeal was never a registered charity and never intended to be such, it was investigated by the Charity Commission. The report of this year-long inquiry, published in June 2004, found that the Mariam Appeal was undertaking charitable work (and so ought to have registered with them), but did not substantiate allegations that any funds had been misused. It emerged some years later that Galloway had appealed in a letter dated 24 April 2003 to Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, to stop the investigation into the Mariam Appeal. According to a report in The Times, after the letter was released under the Freedom of Information Act, Galloway falsely asserted that the Appeal \\"received no money from Iraq\\". A further Charity Commission Report published on 7 June 2007 found that the Appeal had received funds from Fawaz Zureikat that originated from the Oil For Food programme, and concluded that: Although Mr Galloway, Mr Halford and Mr Al-Mukhtar have confirmed that they were unaware of the source of Mr Zureikat's donations, the Commission has concluded that the charity trustees should have made further enquiries when accepting such large single and cumulative donations to satisfy themselves as to their origin and legitimacy. The Commission's conclusion is that the charity trustees did not properly discharge their duty of care as trustees to the Appeal in respect of these donations ... The Commission is also concerned, having considered the totality of the evidence before it, that Mr Galloway may also have known of the connection between the Appeal and the Programme. Galloway, in response, stated: \\"I've always disputed the Commission's retrospective view that a campaign to win a change in national and international policy - a political campaign - was, in fact, a charity\\". Question: What was the appeal meant to do? Answer:","completion":"The Mariam Appeal was created by George Galloway to raise awareness about the suffering of Iraqi people, especially children, due to poor health conditions and lack of suitable medicines and facilities. The appeal aimed to campaign against sanctions on Iraq that many believed were responsible for the situation.

Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person will try to exercise more happens, how will it affect LESS food being digested. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation you are suggesting is that a person exercises more, and you would like to know if this has any effect on the digestion process, specifically, if it results in less food being digested. Exercise can have both direct and indirect effects on the digestion process. 1. Direct effect: When a person exercises, their body's primary focus shifts towards providing energy to the muscles involved in the exercise, increasing blood flow and oxygen supply to these muscles. The body's response to exercise diverts blood flow away from the digestive system and redistributes it to the muscles. As a result, the digestive process may temporarily slow down due to reduced blood flow and therefore less efficient digestion of food. However, this effect is typically temporary, and once the exercise is completed, the blood flow to the digestive system should return to normal rates, allowing the digestion process to continue as usual. 2. Indirect effect: Engaging in regular exercise can improve overall gut health and digestion efficiency in the long run. Exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and prevent obesity, which in turn can reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal problems. Additionally, exercise aids in the movement of food through the digestive tract and helps prevent constipation. Regular physical activity is also linked to a healthier gut microbiome, which plays an essential role in digestion and overall gut health. While it is possible that exercising more might temporarily slow down the digestion process, the indirect benefits of exercise have a more considerable overall positive impact on the digestive system. If a person is concerned about negative impacts on their digestion due to increased exercise, they should ensure proper nutrition, hydration, and gradually increase their exercise routine, allowing their body to adjust to the new demands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen, July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. While at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA NAACP chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary. In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple hitch hiked to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her. The couple lived in Greenwich Village for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1962 and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an identity crisis until later that decade. She received her Master of Fine Arts from UCLA in 1964. While in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was abstract, yet easily recognized as male and female sexual organs. These early works were called Bigamy, and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract penis, which was \\"stopped in flight\\" before it could unite with a vaginal form. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works. Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes. In 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show. In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the \\"California Women in the Arts\\" exhibition at the Lytton Center, to which she answered, \\"I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels.\\" Chicago began working in ice sculpture, which represented \\"a metaphor for the preciousness of life,\\" another reference towards her husband's death. In 1969, the Pasadena Art Museum exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an \\"experimental\\" gallery. Art in America noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the conceptual art movement, and the Los Angeles Times described the work as showing no signs of \\"theoretical New York type art.\\" Chicago would describe her early artwork as minimalist and as her trying to be \\"one of the boys\\". Chicago would also experiment with performance art, using fireworks and pyrotechnics to create \\"atmospheres\\", which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to \\"feminize\\" and \\"soften\\" the landscape. During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the Pasadena Lifesavers, which was a series of abstract paintings that placed acrylic paint on Plexiglas. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes \\"turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,\\" representing her own discovery that \\"I was multi-orgasmic.\\" Chicago credited Pasadena Lifesavers, as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.

Question: suppose If there is no water or fluid to drink happens, how will it affect If more fluid enters the body. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: less Step-by-step explanation: 1. The process begins with fluid waste entering the kidneys. - Fluid intake is crucial in this process as it allows for the waste to enter the kidneys and be processed accordingly. 2. A processing moment in the kidneys allows waste and fluid to pass. - If there is no water or fluid to drink, the body will have less fluid available to process the waste. 3. The kidneys prevent larger molecules from passing. - This process remains unaffected as it relies on the kidney's ability to filter and not the amount of fluid intake. 4. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream. - With less fluid available due to no water or fluid intake, less fluid will return to the bloodstream. This may lead to dehydration and reduced efficiency in detoxifying the body. 5. Bad waste is removed. - This process relies on the available fluid to remove waste from the body. With less fluid to work with, the waste removal will be less efficient. 6. The final product is turned into urine. - Less fluid intake will result in a decrease in urine production, as there is less fluid for the kidneys to process.

The correct ending to this story is Iron Maiden asking to see the character's portfolio. This choice makes the most sense considering the context of the story, which revolves around the Iron Maiden band and their iconic character, Eddie. Other options like \\"British,\\" \\"CNN,\\" \\"LONDON,\\" or \\"England\\" do not refer to specific entities that would be interested in the portfolio. Choices like \\"Eddie\\" and \\"Edward T. Head\\" are incorrect because they are fictional characters and not capable of requesting a portfolio. Lastly, \\"Frankenstein's monster\\" is unrelated to the context of the story, \\"Seventies\\" is not a specific entity, and \\"Derek Riggs\\" (creator of Eddie) was already mentioned earlier in the story. Options \\"Nicko McBrain\\" and \\"Riggs\\" may seem somewhat relevant, but they are still incorrect given that Iron Maiden is the most logical choice overall since the story revolves around the whole band."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: Genetics compression algorithms are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and genetic algorithms adapted to the specific datatype. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading general-purpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200-fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).

Now, let's solve the task using the given input: Input: 82613 Step 1: Check if the given number is greater than 1. 82613 > 1 (True) Step 2: Using a loop, we'll test if there are any whole numbers (other than 1 and the given number) that, when multiplied, result in the given number. We can run the loop from 2 to the square root of the given number (rounded up, inclusive) because any factor larger than the square root will have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root that would have already been checked before. This is more efficient than checking all numbers up to the given number. For 82613, we'll loop from 2 to sqrt(82613), which is approximately 288 (rounded up). Step 3: Check if our loop finds any factors that evenly divide the given number. If it does, the number is not a prime, and we can output 'No' and stop testing further. If the loop finishes without finding any factors, then 82613 is a prime number, and we can output 'Yes'. While checking divisions from 2 to 288 for 82613: - No factors are found during the loop.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"Arròs negre is a traditional and popular Spanish dish that originates from the Valencia and Catalonia regions of Spain. The name 'Arròs negre' translates to 'black rice' in English, which is due to the signature dark color of the dish that comes from its main ingredient, squid ink. This dish holds an important cultural significance in Spain, as it is often served during family gatherings and festive occasions, reflecting the country's rich culinary history and passion for delicious, flavorful food. Ingredients and Preparation: Among the key ingredients of Arròs negre is white rice, which serves as the base component of this dish. The rice is typically short-grain, and it is essential to use a variety that is capable of absorbing the flavors and liquid without becoming too mushy. The most commonly used variety is Bomba rice, which is grown in the Valencia region, although other short-grain rice varieties can also be used if Bomba rice is not available. Besides white rice, the other essential ingredient in Arròs negre is squid ink. The ink imparts the dish's characteristic black color and lends a rich, earthy flavor profile, enhancing the overall taste immensely. Fresh squid and cuttlefish are used in the dish, as they provide the ink that colors the rice and infuse flavor into the dish. Apart from these main ingredients, the dish features a myriad of other ingredients that contribute to its complex flavor. These include garlic, onion, bell peppers, tomatoes, green peas, fish stock, and an assortment of spices like saffron, paprika, and cayenne pepper. The dish is often prepared using a large, shallow pan called a paellera, which allows for even heat distribution and perfect cooking of the ingredients. First, vegetables such as onions, garlic, and bell peppers are sautéed, followed by the addition of squid or cuttlefish and the squid ink. The rice is then added to the pan and coated in the ink mixture before being cooked in a well-seasoned fish broth. The dish is typically simmered until the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed the stock and flavors from the other ingredients. Variations and Serving Suggestions: While the traditional version of Arròs negre is enjoyed and cherished in Spain, there are numerous variations of the dish that add different ingredients to cater to regional tastes or personal preferences. Some people may include seafood like shrimp or mussels, while others may add vegetables like artichokes. The dish can also be adapted to cater to specific dietary requirements, such as substituting vegetable stock for fish stock in a vegetarian version. Arròs negre is best enjoyed hot, often served directly from the paellera in which it was cooked. It is typically accompanied by thick garlic aioli or a squeeze of fresh lemon to enhance the flavors of the dish. Paired with a simple green salad and crusty bread, Arròs negre makes for a satisfying and delightful meal that showcases the diverse culinary traditions and rich flavors of Spain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"a man is underwater sitting at the bottom of the pool\\", can we conclude \\"The man is trying to hold his breath as long as possible.\\"?","completion":"We cannot definitively conclude that \\"The man is trying to hold his breath as long as possible\\" based solely on the information given, which is \\"a man is underwater sitting at the bottom of the pool.\\" Here's a more detailed analysis of the possibilities and factors at play: 1. Holding breath for a challenge or training: The man could be holding his breath to see how long he can do so, as a self-imposed challenge or to train for activities like freediving or swimming. However, we cannot confirm this without more context. 2. Relaxation or meditation: Sitting at the bottom of a pool can be a form of relaxation or meditation for some people. Being submerged in water can provide a sense of tranquility and a unique sensory experience, helping the person to relax and clear their mind. Again, we cannot confirm this without additional information. 3. Performing a task underwater: The man could be underwater for a specific purpose, such as cleaning the pool, retrieving a lost item, or participating in an underwater activity. In such cases, he will hold his breath long enough to complete the task, but this does not necessarily mean he's trying to hold his breath for an extended period. 4. An accident or emergency: If the man is in distress and unable to rise to the surface, such as due to an injury or being trapped, he would need to hold his breath involuntarily but may not be purposefully attempting to hold his breath for as long as possible. Ensuring his safety would be the primary concern in this situation. 5. Breath-holding techniques or equipment: The man might be using techniques to hold his breath longer, such as hyperventilation or specific breathing methods practiced by freedivers. Alternatively, he could be using breathing equipment such as a snorkel or scuba gear, rendering the need to hold his breath less crucial. In conclusion, while it is a possibility that the man is trying to hold his breath as long as possible, there are many alternative reasons for a man being underwater and sitting at the bottom of the pool.

Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams shes been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet exite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies.During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst.Carol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations, but may be partly real.

The cocky lead character beat the odds again, he then made a quip about ever rule having its what? - capsulize idea - train - suck - exception - anarchy The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is \\"exception\\". The saying that every rule has its exception is a popular adage that suggests, regardless of seeming infallibility or general applicability, every rule may have scenarios in which it does not apply. This phrase, in its essence, communicates nuances, versatility, and the unpredictability of life or situations. The story sphere seems to revolve around a cocky lead character who continually triumphs against the odds. Such characters often exhibit smart witticism, audacity, or a knack for fortuitous turns of events. They typically captivate readers or viewers with their unorthodox approach to challenges, appearing to break the rules yet emerging victorious. By making a quip that every rule has its 'exception', the character is using humor and sarcasm to assert his rebellious streak. He seems to be decrying the status quo or established norms, presenting himself as the exception who doesn't adhere to traditional rules and regulations. The 'exception' in this case may symbolize a deviation from the normative, a breaking from tradition, an avant-gardism trait, or an innovative spirit. The term 'exception', in contrast to 'capsulize idea', 'train', 'suck', or 'anarchy', fits into this context more suitably. While the other words could be used metaphorically within certain contexts, they do not directly convey the implication of being an anomaly or 'exception' to the rule. 'Capsulize idea' may suggest a summarized or condensed notion, 'train' could denote instruction or a mode of transportation, 'suck' might express a negative sentiment, and 'anarchy' signifies lawlessness or disorder; none of these words inherently imply an exception to a rule. So, in the context of your scenario where the cocky lead character triumphs against odds and uses a quip about every rule, the phrase that completes the statement logically and congruently is \\"Every rule has its exception\\". Whether this signifies the character's audacious prowess, deviant strategies, or nonconformist thinking, it undoubtedly adds to his distinctive, rule-defying persona."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He beat a 33-hour record set in September by Norwegian TV personality Eli Kari Gjengedal. The \\"Rokerthon\\" also raised some 70,000 for the USO. Roker thanked his team and Mother Nature — an active, cold weather pattern over the United States kept things interesting. During his marathon, which was streamed live online, he did nearly 300 live shots for different TV outlets around the world, as far away as Australia. He wasn't interested when his colleagues asked if he'd try to break his own record next year. \\"I've done this once,\\" he croaked. \\"That's it.\\" ___ Online: http://www.today.com/ ||||| Published on Not only did Al Roker have a fart go TERRIBLY wrong while at the White House... he's OPENLY TALKING ABOUT SHARTING HIS PANTS ON NATIONAL TELEVISION! ||||| Amid all the turmoil at “Today,” NBC News chiefs have staged an “Al Roker intervention” after finally getting fed up with all the silly things the weatherman says, a source tells Page Six. The affable Roker was recently summoned to a meeting with NBC brass and ordered to start thinking before he speaks, following a series of cringe-worthy live gaffes. Classic Roker-isms that left “Today” producers wincing include when he insulted a woman by asking if her husband was her father, and telling a mother in the crowd on the “Today” plaza on Oct. 15 that her crying baby looked like a “Japanese anime.” And let’s not forget the time when he famously joked about Ann Curry during a 2012 chat with Olympic rowers who said the crew throws a teammate into the water after a win. Al snorted, “Which is different than our tradition, which is to throw one of us under the bus. But that’s another story.” Then there was last year’s infamous confession about him soiling his pants at the White House. A source told Page Six, “He was saying weird things and becoming too idiosyncratic. They asked him to act more like a traditional weatherman.” The source added, “Al took their comments to heart and is playing ball.” An NBC rep said, “Al would have had a comment, but it was inappropriate and over-the-top, so we decided we couldn’t release it.” On Thursday, Roker joked on “Today,” “I’m crazy, you can’t trust anything I say … They [The Post] had me say three inappropriate things, and the ones they picked were pretty mild — I’ve said so much worse. Oh my gosh, if you go through, I am crazy!” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The news article discusses how Al Roker, a popular television personality and weather forecaster on NBC's \\"Today\\" show, completed a 34-hour marathon weather forecast, setting a new Guinness World Record for the longest continuous live weather broadcast.

Problem:Paragraph- Sent 1: Imagine you are standing in a farm field in central Illinois. Sent 2: The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. Sent 3: On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. Sent 4: You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. Sent 5: If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. Sent 6: In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Sent 7: Why do you think this is? Sent 8: What could have caused these features? Sent 9: There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. Sent 10: The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. Sent 11: To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Sent 12: Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Sent 13: Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Sent 14: Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. Sent 15: The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Sent 16: Where did glaciers go? Sent 17: Where can you see them today? Sent 18: Glaciers are masses of flowing ice. Question: What are glaciers and what affect do they have on land?. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Writing an incorrect answer Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are large bodies of water that move slowly across land. Explanation: This meets the criteria because it is closely related to the actual definition of glaciers, but it incorrectly refers to them as water instead of ice. This will challenge students who didn't read the paragraph carefully. Part #2: Closely related to the content of the paragraph and/or the question Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are winds that cause erosion of the land. Explanation: This meets the criteria because it is related to the content of the paragraph, specifically Sentence 10, which discusses wind erosion as a plausible explanation for the landscape features. However, this answer does not truthfully respond to the question about what glaciers are and their effect on the land. Part #3: Similar to the given correct answer Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are masses of ice that slowly flow across the land, causing erosion and shaping the landscape. Explanation: This meets the criteria because it is similar to the correct answer, which describes glaciers as masses of flowing ice that caused the land features. However, this answer incorrectly implies that glaciers primarily cause erosion, rather than creating landscape features. Part #4: Prevent those who skip the paragraph from answering the question Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are responsible for creating flat, rolling hills in southern Illinois. Explanation: This meets the criteria because someone who skipped the paragraph might think this is true, since the paragraph discusses a switch from flat land to rolling hills in southern Illinois. But actually reading the paragraph would show that glaciers are responsible for the overall landscape features, not just rolling hills in the south. Part #5: Not trivial and not easily eliminated without reading the paragraph Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are masses of ice that melted 12,000 years ago, causing the flat landscape in central Illinois. Explanation: This meets the criteria because it includes details from the paragraph about the time frame of the glacier (12,000 years ago) and the resulting landscape (flat). However, without reading the paragraph, a student wouldn't necessarily know that the ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States, not just Illinois, and that the glacier's melting caused various landscape features rather than just flatness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Bette Midler (; born December 1, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, comedian, and film producer. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Midler began her professional career in several Off-Off-Broadway plays, prior to her engagements in Fiddler on the Roof and Salvation on Broadway in the late 1960s. She came to prominence in 1970 when she began singing in the Continental Baths, a local gay bathhouse where she managed to build up a core following. Since 1970, Midler has released 14 studio albums as a solo artist. Midler released a new Christmas album titled Cool Yule in 2006, which featured a duet of Christmastime pop standards \\"Winter Wonderland\\"/\\"Let It Snow\\" with Johnny Mathis. Well-received, the album garnered a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album in 2007. The same year, Midler returned to the big screen, appearing in Then She Found Me, Helen Hunt's feature film directorial debut. Also starring Hunt along with Matthew Broderick and Colin Firth, the comedy-drama film tells the story of a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher, who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show, played by Midler, who introduces herself as her biological mother. Critical response to the film was mixed; whereas some critics praised the film for having strong performances, others felt the film was bogged down by a weak script and technical issues. Midler debuted her Vegas show titled Bette Midler: The Showgirl Must Go On at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on February 20, 2008. It comprised The Staggering Harlettes, 20 female dancers called The Caesar Salad Girls and a 13-piece band. The show played its final performance on January 31, 2010, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special in 2011. Also in 2008, another compilation album by Midler, Jackpot: The Best Bette, was released. It reached number 66 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and number six in the United Kingdom, where it was certified platinum for sales of over 300,000 copies. As her only film appearance that year, Midler had a small role in Diane English's comedy film The Women, starring Meg Ryan, Annette Bening and Eva Mendes among others. An updated version of the George Cukor-directed 1939 film of the same name based on a 1936 play by Clare Boothe Luce, the film was widely panned by critics, who found it \\"...a toothless remake of the 1939 classic, lacking the charm, wit and compelling protagonists of the original.\\" Midler appeared on the Bravo TV show My Life on the D-List with Kathy Griffin in an episode that aired in June 2009. In December of the same year, she appeared in the Royal Variety Performance, an annual British charity event attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Midler performed \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" as the closing act. In 2010, Midler voiced the character Kitty Galore in the animated film Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore. The film was a success, grossing 112 million worldwide. In November 2010, Midler released Memories of You, another compilation of lesser known tracks from her catalog. Midler was one of the producers of the Broadway production of the musical Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which opened in February 2011.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made.

As the article states, the current tough economic times have caused people to stop buying cars and houses or going on expensive trips, like to Hawaii. Tokyo Disneyland offers an affordable and pleasant alternative to these costly options, allowing people to temporarily forget their economic worries and enjoy some fun-time. Thus, the economic depression has changed people's plans to spend money and led them to seek more budget-conscious entertainment choices, such as visiting Tokyo Disneyland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The 11-time Paralympic gold medallist has authored a forthcoming report into the subject, which has been brought into sharp focus by recent claims. British Swimming is the latest body to investigate claims of \\"bullying\\", while several ex-riders have spoken of a \\"culture of fear\\" at British Cycling. \\"We must prove we can win medals with a duty of care,\\" Grey-Thompson said. Speaking at a debate organised by the BBC as part of its State of Sport coverage, she added: \\"We've proved we can win medals. I don't think having a duty of care diminishes our chances of winning. \\"We can't make it all warm and cuddly - because that is not what elite sport is. But it is about getting the best talent and not leaving athletes broken at the end of it.\\" Grey-Thompson's report - due for publication \\"imminently\\", she said - was commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. \\"There are some really good sports out there; there are sports that need to do much more,\\" she added. \\"My report doesn't mention a sport in particular, it doesn't mention a particular person in it. It's about the principles of how sport should be as we go forward.\\" On Thursday, Wendy Houvenaghel became the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward with criticisms of British Cycling's World Class programme - following Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley. Houvenaghel said a \\"medal at any cost\\" approach created a \\"culture of fear\\" at the organisation, which she accused of \\"ageism\\" and having \\"zero regard\\" for her welfare. Later on Thursday, BBC sports editor Dan Roan exclusively reported on British Swimming's investigation into multiple bullying claims made by Paralympians about a coach. Swimming was Britain's most successful sport at the Rio Paralympics. The British team won 47 medals - 16 golds of 152 available - and set eight world records. Media playback is not supported on this device Also speaking at Friday's debate, UK Sport chief executive Liz Nichol described the athletes' testimonies as \\"a wake-up call for sport\\". \\"We have to be much more aware of responsibilities, beyond the responsibility of helping athletes achieve what they all aspire to,\\" she said \\"It's clear it can be better, and it will be better. This is a big step-up for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics cycle.\\" UK Sport is the funding body for Olympic and Paralympic sports in Britain. When Nichol was asked whether linking funding to medal targets might have a negative effect on athlete welfare, she replied: \\"We don't reward success, we invest in potential. Speaking about British Cycling's 39-point action plan response to failures identified in a leaked draft report into its World Class Programme, Nichol added: \\"This is something that is very significant. \\"Every sport can learn from it and every sport should be looking at the cycling plan and checking to see if they are doing things properly. \\"Yes it is uncomfortable, but it is right that athletes are speaking out. And it is right that we all acknowledge that something has got to change - and it will change - over this next cycle.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Helen Richardson-Walsh, who starred as Great Britain won Olympic hockey gold in Rio, said she had seen \\"big changes\\" in athlete welfare over her career. \\"Gone are the days where you would get shouted at on the sideline at international level. I don't think that's acceptable in society any more and it is kind of being phased out in sport,\\" the 35-year-old said. \\"What we developed as a team in the last two Olympic cycles was so far removed from that old fashioned in your face coaching and we were more successful. \\"You don't need to go down that route to win. It's not an issue of welfare or medals.\\" Summary:","completion":"Paralympic gold medallist Tanni Grey-Thompson has authored a report on athlete welfare highlighting the need to balance care for athletes with the goal of winning.

Process: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - suppose exercising more heavily happens, how will it affect \\"less oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\". Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"Exercising more heavily affects the process by indirectly impacting a step of the process. When we exercise, the body demands more oxygen to produce energy for the muscles and maintain proper cellular function. In response to this increased demand, the body undergoes several physiological and respiratory changes to adapt and provide the needed oxygen to the body's cells. During heavy exercise, the respiratory rate and the depth of breaths increase. This means you take in more air and therefore more oxygen with each breath, which helps to ensure that the lungs can keep up with the body's increased oxygen demands. This affects the first step of the process where the human body takes a breath inward. The heart rate also increases when exercising. An increased heart rate results in a faster circulation of blood throughout the body, ensuring that red blood cells can deliver oxygen to the cells and tissues more quickly. This indirectly impacts the step in the process where red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach various tissues. Furthermore, during heavy exercise, the capillaries within the muscles dilate or widen to promote increased blood flow to the working muscles. This allows for more efficient oxygen exchange within the small capillaries where the heme release the oxygen. This indirectly impacts the step of the process in which oxygen is released and is transported to the cells within the tissue. It is worth noting that when exercising at very high intensities or for prolonged periods, it is possible that the body's oxygen needs may temporarily exceed its ability to deliver oxygen. In such cases, the body compensates by relying more on anaerobic (without oxygen) energy pathways. However, this is not a direct perturbation of the oxygen transport process; rather, it is a temporary adjustment to meet the increased demands of heavy exercise. In conclusion, exercising more heavily indirectly impacts the process of oxygen transportation in the body. Various physiological and respiratory adjustments are made to meet the increased oxygen demands of the body's cells, promoting overall efficiency in oxygen delivery and utilization during periods of intense exercise."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given a short passage that may convey stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated.

Q: Passage: Hoping to rebound from their blowout loss at Green Bay, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers took the early lead in the first quarter, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak. The Broncos grabbed the lead, when cornerback Cassius Vaughn returned an interception off Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers 55 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers responded, with a 32-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos extended their lead in the second quarter, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Chargers would re-claim the lead, with a 2-yard touchdown run by Rivers, a 28-yard field goal by Novak, followed by a 42-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to wide receiver Malcom Floyd, giving San Diego a 23-10 halftime lead. The Broncos benched quarterback Kyle Orton in favor of Tim Tebow. After a scoreless third quarter, the Chargers added to their lead, with a 51-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos responded, when Tebow scrambled for a 12-yard touchdown (with a two-point conversion run by running back Willis McGahee), then threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to running back Knowshon Moreno (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), to pull the Broncos to within 26-24 with just over three minutes left in the game. The Chargers responded, with a 35-yard field goal by Novak.

SINGAPORE — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed Tuesday \\"to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\" during a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who then unexpectedly said he was suspending military drills with South Korea. Kim's commitment to denuclearize was included in a document signed after the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. It calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides promised to hold follow-up negotiations. While the document didn't lay out a specifics regarding denuclearization, Trump said at a news conference \\"We're starting that process very quickly.

Input: Passage: Charles V returned to Spain on July 16, 1522. Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur, but only sporadically. Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros, or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king, and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much. Back in Valladolid, Charles declared a general pardon on November 1. The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of 293 comuneros, a small figure given the huge number of rebels. Both Pacheco and Bishop Acuña were among the 293 excluded from the pardon. More pardons were issued later, after pressure from the Cortes; by 1527, the repression was completely at end.

Information: - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks. It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\" - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633 26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy. - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence. - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power. - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility). - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna. - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism. - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).

English is also as an important international language in many other countries, like China and Japan. People in these countries use it for business, and travelers to these countries use English when they get there. Other people may learn English because they enjoy reading books in English, listening to British or American music or watching American films. English has changed a lot these years and still goes on changing. It is no longer right to talk about British English or American English if the speaker doesn't come from those countries. People in Japan or Korea, for example, may use the American spelling but may not sound like Americans. English will be the most widely used language in the world in the 21stcentury.

This culinary delight brings together the irresistible taste of bacon and the spongy sweetness of a cupcake to create a harmonious blend of flavors that will have you wondering why you didn't try this sooner. Follow these easy steps to whip up a batch of tempting bacon-infused cupcakes that are perfect for any occasion. Preparing the Ingredients Before delving into the art of baking these unique cupcakes, gather all the necessary ingredients. You will need: - Bacon rashers (preferably thick-cut) - Cupcake mix or ingredients for making cupcakes from scratch - Eggs - Coffee - Buttermilk - Vegetable oil - Frosting - Chopped bacon for garnish Begin by cooking the bacon rashers to your desired level of crispiness. Drain the cooked bacon on a paper towel and let it cool. Once cool, roughly chop the bacon into small pieces. Set aside. Preparing the Cupcake Batter Creating an aromatic and well-balanced bacon-infused cupcake begins with the perfect batter. Add all the dry ingredients required for the cupcakes into a large mixing bowl. This may include flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt, depending on the specific recipe you are using. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the wet ingredients – eggs, coffee, buttermilk, and vegetable oil. The coffee will enhance the flavor profile of these cupcakes without overpowering the bacon. Similarly, buttermilk adds a moist texture and a slight tangy flavor to the mix, which complements the bacon's saltiness. Whisk the wet ingredients together until it becomes a smooth mixture. Slowly incorporate the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring gently until the batter is uniformly mixed and free of lumps. Then, sprinkle ¾ of the chopped bacon into the cake batter and gently fold, ensuring that the bacon pieces are evenly distributed. Baking the Cupcakes Preheat your oven according to the cupcake recipe you're using (usually 350°F or 175°C). Line a cupcake tin with cake cases or silicone cups. Carefully pour the batter into the prepared cake cases or silicone cups, filling them about ¾ full to allow room for the cupcakes to rise. Place the loaded cupcake tray into the preheated oven. Bake the cupcakes for the recommended time mentioned in your recipe, typically 15-20 minutes. You can check the readiness of your cupcakes by inserting a toothpick or skewer into the center of a cupcake – if it comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, the cupcakes are ready. Cooling and Frosting the Cupcakes Once the cupcakes have finished baking, remove the tray from the oven and allow it to cool for at least five minutes. Gently take the cupcakes out of the tray and place them on a cooling rack to cool completely. This step is crucial, as attempting to frost warm cupcakes will result in the frosting melting and becoming a mess. When the cupcakes have cooled completely, it's time to frost them. Select your preferred frosting, such as cream cheese, chocolate, or vanilla. Using a piping bag fitted with an appropriate nozzle or a flat spatula, frost the cupcakes in a decorative and appealing manner. For a finishing touch, sprinkle the remaining chopped bacon over the frosted cupcakes. Conclusion Bacon-infused cupcakes provide a unique combination of flavors that are sure to impress your friends and family. This savory-sweet delight will undoubtedly become one of your favorite desserts to share at gatherings, parties, or to enjoy by yourself. The blend of bacon and cupcakes is truly a match made in culinary heaven.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: I heard that Tracy was nowhere to be seen as they looked everywhere for her. And I was wondering What does Tracy need to do before this? The answer is:","completion":"Before Tracy found herself in a situation where she was nowhere to be seen and people were frantically searching for her, there are several steps and precautions she could have taken to ensure her safety, effective communication, and ease of finding her if needed. While it is not always possible to predict the circumstances that led to her disappearance, here is a detailed list of actions she could have taken prior to this event: 1. Inform someone before leaving: Tracy should have let a close friend, family member, or coworker know where she was going, with whom, and the approximate duration of her outing. By providing necessary information about her whereabouts, she would lessen the likelihood of any potential confusion or panic. 2. Have a plan in place: It's important to establish a proper plan and timeline for any outing, especially if Tracy is visiting a new and unfamiliar place. She should have researched the location, the routes she would take, any potential hazards, and notable landmarks she could use for easier navigation. 3. Carry personal identification and emergency contact details: Tracy should always have her ID, driver's license, or any other forms of identification, along with her emergency contact details (e.g., a close family member's phone number) with her. This information can be crucial in case of an emergency or if someone finds her belongings. 4. Keep her cell phone charged and easily accessible: A fully charged cell phone is an indispensable safety tool. Tracy should have ensured her phone was charged before leaving, and she should have kept it within easy reach. That way, she could easily stay in contact with others or even use various location-sharing applications to let her friends or family know her location. 5. Establish regular check-ins: Tracy could have set up regular check-ins with someone she trusted. She could have agreed to send text messages, make phone calls, or use other forms of communication at specific time intervals to provide updates on her whereabouts and overall well-being. 6. Use the buddy system: If possible, Tracy should have opted to go with a group or at least one other person. Large groups tend to be easier to spot, and having more people can lower the risk of losing someone. 7. Dress appropriately: Wearing bright or distinctive clothing can make it easier for others to notice and locate her in a crowd or a busy area. In addition, dressing for the weather and terrain conditions is important for overall safety and comfort during any outing. 8. Learn basic navigation skills and carry some navigation tools: Tracy could have equipped herself with knowledge of basic navigation skills like reading maps, using a compass, or even relying on natural navigational cues. Carrying a physical map or compass may further reduce the risk of getting lost. 9. Be mindful of time: It's essential for Tracy to keep track of time throughout her excursion. By doing so, she can ensure that time does not slip away, leading to concerns from her friends or family and potential search efforts. By implementing these safety measures and effective communication strategies before her outing, Tracy could have significantly reduced the chances of being lost or unreachable, and in turn, minimized the need for an exhaustive search for her."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: In this family photo provided by Kevin Smith are Peggy and Kevin Smith of Dayton, Nev. Peggy was 4 months old when her father, Pfc. John Eddington, was killed in action in World War II. Seven decades... (Associated Press) A World War II soldier's heartfelt letter to his daughter has finally reached her, seven decades after it was written. Peggy Eddington-Smith received the letter penned by her father, Pfc. John Eddington, as well as his Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals, during an emotional ceremony Saturday in Dayton, Nev., about 40 miles southeast of Reno. The father she never met wrote the three-page letter shortly after she was born and shortly before he died in Italy in June 1944. He sent it while stationed in Texas, just before he was sent overseas. Getting his medals was nice, but the letter meant more because it made her feel closer to her father, Eddington-Smith said. She knew little about him since her mother could rarely bring herself to discuss the love of her life. \\"The letter gave me more knowledge of who he was,\\" she told The Associated Press. \\"He poured out his heart to me, and a lot of men don't put that kind of emotion in writing. I'm just overwhelmed by everything, trying to absorb everything.\\" Donna Gregory of St. Louis found the soldier's letter and other World War II memorabilia in a box 14 years ago while helping her then-husband clean out his grandparents' home in Arnold, Mo., a St. Louis suburb. Gregory's voice cracked with emotion as she read the letter Saturday, bringing tears to Eddington-Smith and many in the crowd of about 150. The soldier devoted the first page to his wife, saying he hoped she did not find it \\"silly\\" that he was writing a letter to a child who could not read. Addressing the next two pages to his \\"darling\\" daughter, he wrote that while she may not see him \\"for some time,\\" he wanted her to know that she was always on his mind. \\"I love you so much,\\" the letter says. \\"Your mother and daddy ... are going to give you everything we can. We will always give you all the love we have.\\" Eddington urged his daughter to \\"always treat your mother right. You have the sweetest mother on the Earth.\\" He closed the letter by writing, \\"I love you with all my heart and soul forever and forever. Your loving daddy.\\" Eddington-Smith and Gregory are unsure what connection the soldier had to the couple who owned the house where his memorabilia was found. Eddington was from Leadwood, Mo., about 75 miles southwest of St. Louis. Gregory tracked down Smith in June after a search that involved libraries and the Internet. Both women cried during their initial phone conversation that left the daughter shocked by the items' discovery. Eddington-Smith knew her father died in the war. She was unaware of the letter and other contents of the box, including 16 letters from Eddington to his mother, his draft card and military dog tags, his high school diploma and newspaper clips. An only child, she grew up in St. Louis and lived there until her mid-20s. She moved with her four children to Nevada in 1972 after a divorce. Her mother, Helen, never remarried and died in 1997. \\"I would ask my mother why she didn't get remarried and her only comment was that she found the perfect man and will never again find the perfect man,\\" Eddington-Smith said. ___ Associated Press Correspondent Jim Salter in St. Louis contributed to this story. ||||| Over 12 years ago, In Donna Gregory's home of her ex-husband she discovered a box with the words “War Department” on it. Inside was personal letters and something else very special. Here is her story. “It was in the closet of his grandparents room. When I got to the bottom the box I discovered to my amazement, a PURPLE HEART medal was inside. No one in my ex husband's family could tell me who this soldier was or why his grandparents had the Medal and Letters. I took the box home with me that day and my journey began. I spent countless hours researching who this soldier was, where he was killed, where was he buried? Was he married? Did he have children? What I discovered was a heartbreaking truth. Yes, he was married and had one infant daughter that he never got to meet. Her name was Peggy Arlene Eddington, born Feb 5, 1944. Her father Pvt. John F. Eddington was killed a short four months later in Italy, on June 27, 1944. I was able to find that he was buried at Jefferson Barracks here in St Louis, MO. He was originally from a nearby small town called Leadwood, MO. I tracked his daughter to Nevada but never could find current residence for her. A few months ago I finally decided to widen my search in hopes of finding his daughter before something happened to her. I am proud to say, IT WORKED! After a lot of friends and complete strangers started spending time doing their own searches and seeking information, it all started coming together, one lead, led to another. Within a few weeks I had found her grandson, which led me to her son and then to Peggy! I was overjoyed! See, the thing I haven’t explained yet is I have spent years haunted by a TWO PAGE LETTER written on Feb 27, 1944 (Peggy at that time was only three weeks old) by her father from Italy. It said,”how much her daddy loved her” and other heart warming things. He was killed just a short four months after writing that letter. Peggy never knew this letter existed until I spoke with her on the phone. She has never seen her father’s Medal! Now, My friends began helping me raise money to get to Nevada. One of my friends sent the story to our local television station for this “PAY IT FORWARD” segment. Here is a link to the story and video of them surprising me in my office. I would love to meet up with some VETS or members of your organization and ride along the day I actually get to deliver the items to Peggy at her home. (Heck even if anyone along my route would like to take the journey with me from Missouri to Nevada, how awesome would that be?) I would like to be the one to personal hand her father’s letter to her, but It would be MY HONOR to maybe have a WWll Vet or someone from the military actually hand the medal to her! She Lives in Dayton, NV near Carson City.” Does your organization have contacts that could help me organize something like this? I would very much like to make this a special day for a woman that never knew her father, never even knew these items existed until now… Email or call me if you think you want to help me make this a day her and her family will never forget! I look forward to hearing back from you, Thank you for all you do!! Donna Gregory Here is the amazing follow up: Donna reached out to Dan Rash and the VFW Riders in Virginia City and Dayton for help and they were very happy and honored to respond. They shared this information with other Military, the Governor,Commissioner Mr. Amodie and the local newspapers in our area.

Speciation events: The question itself suggests that speciation events show evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. This answer choice seems to be the most logical fit. 2. Leptospirosis: Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that affects humans and animals, and is not directly related to evolution over geologic time or above the level of species. 3. Cliffs: Cliffs are geographical features and do not indicate evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. 4. Rapid expansion: Rapid expansion can be a process in various contexts (such as universe or population growth), but it does not directly pertain to evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. 5. Peachleaf willow: The peachleaf willow is a species of willow, and as a single species, it does not show evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. 6. Swamp vegetation: Swamp vegetation refers to plants found in a swamp habitat, but does not directly indicate evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. 7. Darwin: Charles Darwin is a biologist known for his contributions to the theory of evolution, but he is not a process or event showing evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. 8. RNA: RNA (ribonucleic acid) plays a role in the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and expression, but it does not show evolution over geologic time above the level of the species as directly as speciation events do.

Cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into the stream. Which of the following will most likely occur? Available options: --The soft drink cans will absorb cold energy from the stream's water.; --The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's.; --The temperature of the soft drinks will not change since the cans are sealed.; --The temperature of the cans will decrease to freezing as long as the stream is flowing.;. Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step. 1. The soft drink cans will absorb cold energy from the stream's water. Cold energy is not a scientifically valid term. Heat transfer occurs when there is a difference in temperature. In this case, the heat from the soft drink cans will transfer to the cooler stream water. 2. The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's. This option seems plausible. The temperature of the soft drink cans is higher than the temperature of the stream water. The cans will lose heat to the cooler water until they reach thermal equilibrium, meaning both the cans and the water will be the same temperature. 3. The temperature of the soft drinks will not change since the cans are sealed. This option is incorrect. Sealed or not, heat can still transfer between the soft drinks and the surrounding environment. The aluminum cans are good conductors of heat, allowing heat to transfer between the soft drinks and the stream water. So, the temperature of the soft drinks will change. 4. The temperature of the cans will decrease to freezing as long as the stream is flowing. This option is also incorrect. The cans' temperature will reach equilibrium with the stream water temperature, which is 18°C, not freezing (0°C). Based on the analysis of each option, the most likely outcome is: Answer: --The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The mention of \\"s club moves\\" refers to a dance group which is known for upbeat and catchy music. Therefore, the tone appears to be light-hearted and potentially complimentary. 2. Context: The context of the tweet revolves around dance moves and the assumption that the receiver (@Darth_Disco) might know some S Club dance moves. This statement showcases that the sender is trying to associate the receiver with an entertaining and dynamic activity which is typically associated with positive sentiment. 3. Sarcasm and Irony: Although it is important to consider the possibility of sarcasm or irony in tweets, in this case, there are no definitive signs indicating that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic or ironic. In the absence of such indications, the tweet is more likely to have positive sentiment. 4. Emoticons and abbreviations: The tweet does not contain any emoticons or abbreviations which might give a clearer idea of the sentiment.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Input: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Recently I've developed a good interest for backpacking and camping; hiking trails. In my excitement I've told my girlfriend about my plans, which involves hiking around 10-15 miles per day for a couple of days strait in order to finish a section of a trail I selected. She was excited about the idea, but didn't feel like she is capable of walking that specific distance every day. I didn't really dare to tell her I wanted to do this alone, since she sometimes is really afraid I want to do these things just to be away from her, when in reality I really just want to do these things because I think they're interesting and challenging. So what I did was try and alter the plans so she would be able to join me, where I dialed back the distance walked every day and included a hotel stop along the way. The hike would be spread out over one week in total, and she felt like she would maybe be capable of this. Since she told me this I've spent some time on searching for good gear, with which we could do this together. For context, we've lived together for 1 year now and shared one big vacation together and several other smaller trips. We've recently bought a car and are planning to go on a road trip with just the two of us in summer. I'm really looking forward to spending that time together. When I get excited about something I really dig into it and I've spent a good portion of my time last week reading into proper hiking gear for two people. My girlfriend thinks I am diving too deep into it, and she is doubting my wish to want to do the hike this year. She was trying her best to change my mind and give me alternatives, which didn't involve thru-hiking (which I really want to do). On my end, I'm really excited and almost feel like I can't wait a couple of years before I undertake such an endeavour. My girlfriend thinks me wanting to hike alone is an early sign of me wanting to break up with her, which I don't agree with, it's just something I really feel like I would want to do alone. Being in nature, away from civilization, for a certain period of time - being alone and having to rely completely on yourself, that just feels right to me. Maybe I should have been honest from the start, and tell her I really wanted to do this alone. I recognize that, but I am just wondering if the idea of wanting to hike alone makes me an asshole to begin with? Is it weird to take a one-week holiday alone when you're in a starting relationship? Especially in order to do something that is really going to challenge me on a very personal level? I don't have a good reference point to compare myself to, so I'm really wondering what other people would say. TLDR; I want to hike alone, my girlfriend doesn't want me to and thinks of it as an early sign of me wanting to break up with her.

Hair-pulling: 'My hands were my enemies' (CNN) -- Christina Pearson was half-bald at age 13. She just couldn't stop pulling her hair, and ended up taking out every lock from the tops of her ears to the crown of her head. Trichotillomania is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great length to hide it, experts say. \\"It was absolutely terrifying because I was a very bright child, and doing great in school,\\" she said. \\"The doctor had no idea what it was.\\" Pearson continued pulling her hair throughout her teens, 20s, and early 30s. It wasn't until she was 33 that she learned her condition had a name: trichotillomania. She became inspired to start an organization, called the Trichotillomania Learning Center, to help other sufferers of the disorder. It turns out that this condition, characterized by the urge to pull hair from one's body, affects about 2 to 4 percent of the population, according to the Trichotillomania Learning Center. A new study published this week in the Archives of General Psychiatry may hold promise for those who compulsively pull their hair. Researchers say participants who took an antioxidant called N-acetylcysteine, sold over the counter at vitamin stores, had significant improvement over patients who took placebos. The dietary supplement used in the study is known for its benefits to the kidneys and liver, said lead author Dr. John Grant at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, who is on the advisory board of the Trichotillomania Learning Center. More recently it has been shown to affect glutamate, a chemical messenger in the brain that seems to be involved in compulsive repetitive behaviors, he said. The sample size was small -- 50 people -- but the study has generated enthusiasm among trichotillomania researchers. \\"This is one of the bigger advances we've had within this field in a long time,\\" said Doug Woods, associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Psychologists are still debating how to categorize trichotillomania, Woods said. Many believe it is related to obsessive compulsive disorder, but others liken it to addictions or impulse control disorders. Researchers are unsure of exactly what goes on in the brain with this disorder. Some people with trichotillomania feel pleasure in pulling hair, while others describe it as \\"calming,\\" and still others have no idea why they do it, Grant said. There may be differences in the brain pathways among people with the condition, he said. For Pearson, pulling hair up made her feel as if her whole nervous system lit up, she said. \\"Basically my fingers would search for a texture, a certain type of hair, when I found it, I would pull it out,\\" she said. \\"I would feel like I had found gold.\\" The condition affects primarily women and usually begins in childhood or adolescence, Woods said. The term, coined in 1889 by a Greek physician, comes from the Greek words for its features: \\"tricho\\" means \\"hair,\\" \\"till\\" means \\"to pull,\\" and \\"mania\\" means \\"frenzy.\\" Long before the disorder had a name, the idea of compulsive hair-pulling had been known for hundreds of years, Woods said. The two main kinds of medications that have been used for trichotillomania are selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors -- SSRIs, used for depression -- and the OCD drug chlorimipramine, Woods said. The antidepressants may help patients' anxiety and depression but don't actually help the pulling, whereas chlorimipramine has been shown to dampen the pulling impulse somewhat. But the treatment that has demonstrated the most effectiveness so far is behavior therapy, Woods said. The dietary supplement probably will not replace the need for behavioral therapy, but future research may find that they two approaches work well together, Grant said. Before trying N-acetylcysteine, people should consult their physicians, particularly to determine whether there are interactions that the supplement could have with other medications the patient already takes, Grant said. Experts say there are still many people who compulsively pull their hair and don't know that they are not the only ones. Trichotillomania is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great lengths to hide it -- to explain bald spots to acquaintances, some patients will lie and say they had cancer, Woods said. \\"I have talked to patients who have pulled for 25 years, and their husbands don't even know it, they hide it so well,\\" he said. People with the disorder don't just pull from their heads -- they also pull hair from their eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic regions, Woods said. Living with the disease, Pearson at times felt suicidal. She dropped out of high school because she was terrified of her friends finding out. \\"There was a time in my early 20s when I really, seriously considered, could I cut my hands off and live my life?\\" she said. \\"My hands were my enemies, because they pulled my hair.\\" To manage her condition 18 years ago, Pearson tried relaxation techniques for the situations that led to her pulling. For example, she tended to pull her hair while driving, so she bought thin leather gloves and told herself that she could not remove them -- or pull her hair -- until she turned the car off. Today, there are many more strategies available to help people identify the triggers for hair-pulling and figure out the best way to control the impulses in those situations, Pearson said. The Trichotillomania Learning Center has assisted more than 100,000 people in some way since 1991, Pearson said. The organization holds conferences, retreats, professional training sessions, and other programs to help people manage the disorder. The center also helps health care professionals learn about treating people for the condition. \\"To experience the entrapment of this type of compulsion, and then to experience the freedom of living without it is a gift I wish for everyone,\\" Pearson said.

Which language is this?","completion":"The text \\"Tvoje máma je v pohodě, a ty máš mně\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. In this particular sentence, the speaker is saying something along the lines of \\"Your mother is fine (or cool), and you have me.\\" The speaker may be trying to convey that the listener's mother is doing well, and the speaker is there to support the listener. This could be a friendly or comforting statement. Czech is a highly inflected language, which means that words change their forms due to grammatical functions, such as case, gender, and number. This makes Czech quite complex in grammar compared to other languages like English. Czech uses the Roman alphabet, with additional diacritic marks placed on some vowels and consonants to indicate changes in pronunciation. Czech has a rich history and dates back to the early Middle Ages when Latin was replaced by the Old Church Slavonic in the region. Over the years, the language has evolved through many stages, such as Old Czech, Middle Czech, Early Modern Czech, and the contemporary Czech that is spoken today. Czech literature and culture have played a significant role in the development of European culture, producing renowned authors like Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, and Václav Havel. The language is also known for its remarkably precise pronunciation, which has led to the development of a unique form of theater called \\"black light theatre.\\" In this theatrical form, artists perform in a darkened room illuminated only by ultraviolet lamps, creating an overall mesmerizing visual experience.

Answer the following question: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. Which friend learned less about animals that survive in greater numbers? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's review what Greg and Frank studied: Greg studied natural selection, which is a process determining the survival and reproduction of organisms with beneficial heritable traits. Organisms that possess these traits tend to survive in greater numbers.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: It's possible to avoid a serious sin but still do? Context: Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4] The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, it's possible to avoid a serious sin but still do something that requires discipline. In the context provided, two forms of disciplinary actions that are lesser than disfellowshipping are mentioned: Reproof and Marking. Reproof is given to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin, resulting in a temporary loss of privileges of service but no restriction of fellowship. Marking, on the other hand, entails curtailing social but not spiritual fellowship when a baptized member persists in a course of action that violates Bible principles but is not considered a serious sin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They both ask about the story or history behind a Mayan flute with gold inlay, specifically a snake flute. The only difference is in the phrasing of the questions. To answer the question, I will research the history of Mayan flutes, focusing on those with snake themes and gold inlay. Step 1: Research Mayan flutes Mayan flutes were wind instruments used by the ancient Mayan civilization in Central America. They were often associated with religious rituals and festivities, and were made from a variety of materials including bone, wood, and clay. Step 2: Gather information on snake-themed Mayan flutes The snake symbolized many things in Mayan culture, including rebirth, transformation, and the Earth. As a result, snake-themed flutes were likely used to invoke these meanings during ceremonies, performances, and rituals. Step 3: Focus on the role of gold in Mayan flutes Gold was an important material in Mayan culture, symbolizing power, wealth, and divinity. Inlaid gold on a Mayan flute would have increased its prestige, denoting it as a valuable and sacred item. Based on the research, it can be concluded that the Mayan snake flute with gold inlay is an artifact from the ancient Mayan civilization, probably used in religious rituals and ceremonies due to its snake design and gold inlay. The snake theme would have invoked the various symbolic meanings associated with snakes in Mayan culture, such as rebirth, transformation, and the Earth, while the gold inlay reflected the flute's elevated status as a sacred and valuable object."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

He hides his journal in a shrine to the Virgin Mary outside the castle and descends into the crypt, where he finds Dracula and the vampire woman resting in their coffins. Armed with a stake, he impales the woman, who, as he looks on, immediately ages from young to old. Whilst he does this, the sun sets, and when he turns to Dracula's coffin with the intention of killing the vampire, he finds it empty. Looking up, Harker is in time to see the Count shut the door and they are both plunged into darkness... A few days have passed Dr. Van Helsing then arrives in Klausenburg, looking for Harker. An inn keeper's daughter gives him Harker's journal. When he arrives at the castle, it is deserted; a hearse carriage speeds by with a coffin in it.

Staking Harker, he leaves to deliver the veiled news of Harker's death in person to a wary Arthur Holmwood and his wife Mina, brother and sister-in-law of Harker's fiancÃ©e Lucy Holmwood. Lucy is ill, so the news is kept from her and Lucy's little niece, Tania.

(a). dog would prevent allergic reactions.; (b). cat would prevent allergic reactions.;","completion":"Adam adopted the cat instead of the dog because the cat would prevent allergic reactions. This decision might have initially been difficult, but Adam ultimately understood that it was crucial to prioritize his overall health and well-being over immediate preferences or desires. In making this conscious choice, he was able to balance both his love for animals and ensure a comfortable environment within his living space. While both dogs and cats make for fantastic pets, they can impact individuals differently. Some people often experience allergies that are triggered by various factors, including pet dander, hair, or saliva. In Adam's case, it was essential to take these factors into consideration when deciding which pet to ultimately adopt. Although it's generally thought that cats are more likely to cause allergic reactions in people, this is not always the case. In fact, some cats may indeed be less allergenic than others, making it possible for individuals like Adam to enjoy the perks of pet ownership without all the sneezing and itching that can ensue. Certain breeds, such as the hypoallergenic Siberian or the hairless Sphynx, are known to be less likely to provoke allergies in humans. Contrastingly, although dogs can bring immense joy and companionship, they too can cause allergies in certain people. The allergens produced by dogs – specifically, proteins found in their skin cells, urine, and saliva – can trigger various reactions in those sensitive to these proteins. Depending on the breed, size, and amount of shedding, certain dogs may provoke stronger allergic reactions than others. Knowing that the cat he intended to adopt had a lower likelihood of causing allergies, Adam proceeded with the adoption. He remained mindful of maintaining a clean environment, investing in strategies to minimize potential allergy triggers. For instance, regular grooming and bathing of the cat, frequent vacuuming, and the use of air purifiers can all contribute to a more allergy-friendly environment. Ultimately, Adam's decision to adopt a cat over a dog proved to be the right one for him. Not only was he able to provide a loving home to a feline in need, but also successfully managed to prevent any troublesome allergic reactions. As the bond between Adam and his new companion grew, so did his confidence in the choice he had made. It was clear that the love, loyalty, and warmth shared between them were genuinely priceless, making it abundantly clear that Adam had made a well-informed and wise decision in adopting his charming, endearing, and allergy-friendly feline."},{"prompt":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Settled by the Celts, invaded by the Romans and the Normans, and ruled by the English, Wales' population has regularly changed over the ages. Wales, particularly South Wales, became a melting pot of European nationalities and cultures. At first workers from England, Ireland and the rural areas of Wales rushed into the coalfields of South Wales. By 1911, workers from Ireland, Italy and Spain had joined the industrial workforce there. Many of these newcomers were prepared to work for less pay. But during this period, workers, dissatisfied with regular pay cuts, poor safety, the growing trend of employers to pay workers with tokens , which could only be spent in the company store, returned to the land. In 1891, the rural population of Wales was about 616,000 and by 1911 just over 649,000 people lived and worked in these areas. The rural population continues to grow slowly even today. People from richer parts of the UK, particularly southern England, are buying holiday or retirement homes in Wales. In some areas this has led to a shortage of affordable housing for local people. This, combined with the lack of employment prospects in rural Welsh communities, has started a new movement of people in search of jobs and homes into the towns and cities of Wales and to other parts of the UK and Europe. As so many Welsh people have migrated to other countries over the last 200 years, it's really no surprise that many visitors come to see friends and s -- there were 229,000 visitors in 1998. These visitors strengthen their links to their land of origin and continue to support the Welsh economy. During the hot summer days, about 28% of the visitors visit the countryside and nearly 70% visit the seaside. Options: A Tourism, the main economic source of Wales.

Use rhyming words for rhythm: Rhyming words are words that sound the same at the end, like \\"cat\\" and \\"hat\\" or \\"tree\\" and \\"bee.\\" When you use these words in your poem, it makes a fun, bouncy rhythm. This rhythm can make your poem more enjoyable to read or listen to, just like a cool song! 2. Write with metaphors and similes: Metaphors and similes are ways to make your poem really colorful and exciting. They help us compare things in a creative way. For example, if you want to describe a bright, sunny day, you could say, \\"The sun was a big, shiny smiley face in the sky.\\" That's a metaphor! A simile is when we use the words \\"like\\" or \\"as\\" to compare things. For example, \\"The sun was as warm as a cozy blanket.\\" 3. No worries about length: Don't worry if your poem is very short or very long. What's important is that it comes from your heart and tells the story or feeling you want to share. Some poems are only a few words, and others take up many pages. Just let your creativity guide you! 4. Revise your first draft: After writing your poem, take a little break and then come back to read it again. This will help you see if you want to change anything or add more details. It's okay to make changes to your poem, as this helps make it even better! 5. Create a final draft: After making any changes or improvements, you're ready to write the final draft of your poem.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of being more anorexic can have an effect on the process and possibly lead to less use of insulin in the body. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by severe calorie restriction, fear of weight gain, and an unhealthy obsession with body weight and shape. Due to a lower intake of food and nutrients, individuals with anorexia are likely to have a reduced need for insulin, as there is less sugar entering the bloodstream from the digestion of food. This could have several indirect effects on the process: 1. Reduced energy levels: With less sugar being converted into energy, the body may experience fatigue and a feeling of weakness. 2. Slowed metabolism: Since the body is getting less energy from food, it could slow down the metabolism in an attempt to preserve the limited energy stores. 3. Muscle wasting: If the body is not getting enough energy from food, it may begin to break down muscle to provide the necessary energy. 4. Hormonal changes: A lack of nutrients and energy could cause the body to enter a state of starvation, leading to hormonal imbalances and potential disruptions of normal bodily functions, such as menstrual cycles in women. 5. Altered brain function: Reduced insulin levels and energy stores can impact the brain and lead to cognitive impairments, such as difficulty concentrating and memory problems. Additionally, the relationship between anorexia nervosa and insulin resistance is complex. Some studies suggest that individuals with anorexia may develop insulin resistance due to the stresses placed on the body during periods of severe calorie restriction. This could further reduce the body's ability to use insulin effectively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Choices: - heart attack - falling down - weight loss - stitches - exhaustion The rationale to choose \\"stitches\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The most likely result of falling in gravel while running is the need for stitches, among the options provided - heart attack, falling down, weight loss, stitches, and exhaustion. Falling in gravel can result in a person getting cuts, scrapes, and abrasions due to the rough and uneven surface of the gravel. Additionally, the small stones present in the gravel can cause the wounds to be deeper and more significant than those caused by falling on a smooth surface. Consequently, this may lead to the need for stitches to close any deep gashes and promote healing. Stitches are used to hold the edges of a wound together, allowing the skin and underlying tissues to heal properly and minimize scarring. Although it is true that falling down is an apparent consequence of tripping while running, the given options seem to assume that a fall has already occurred. Therefore, taking that context into consideration, \\"falling down\\" would not be considered an outcome of the fall itself but rather a part of the incident. A heart attack is not a likely result of falling in gravel while running, as it is usually caused by a blockage in the blood supply to the heart muscle. Factors such as an unhealthy diet, smoking, and lack of physical activity are more closely related to heart attacks. Though falls can happen due to a heart attack if one experiences it while running, the falling itself doesn't generally cause a heart attack in an otherwise healthy person. Weight loss is also an unlikely result of falling in gravel while running, as it would require a sustained effort toward exercise and a proper diet. Weight loss is a long-term goal and cannot be achieved simply by experiencing a fall. Of course, engaging in regular running as a form of exercise can contribute to weight loss, but the fall itself is not a direct factor in losing weight. Lastly, exhaustion may result from running in general, but it is not a direct outcome of falling in gravel. A person might feel physically and emotionally drained after a fall, but the exhaustion of recovering from the fall is separate from the overall exhaustion caused by running. Furthermore, exhaustion is temporary, whereas stitches may be needed to address a serious injury resulting from the fall. In conclusion, among the provided choices, \\"stitches\\" is the most likely and logical result of falling in gravel while running due to the nature of the gravel surface causing potential deep cuts and abrasions that may require medical intervention."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. How long did it take the boulder to hit the sergeant?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Russian academics are calling for a scientific probe into claims of a 'Siberian Loch Ness monster' in one of the world's remotest lakes. Researchers using underwater scanners have found evidence of 'Nesski' - measuring up to 33 feet in length - in the deep waters of Lake Labynkyr, says a new report. Intriguingly, the evidence is at a lake where native Evenk and Yakut people have long claimed an underwater creature lurks. Proof: This photograph, said to be the head of the underwater beast, is being used as evidence to prove the existence of a Siberian Loch Ness monster. The evidence includes a picture which, it is claimed, shows the monster, says the Siberian Times. Known as ‘the Devil', testimony dating back to the 19th century says the monster has enormous jaws. Associate Professor Lyudmila Emeliyanova, of Moscow State University, told The Siberian Times that on her own scientific mission to Labynkyr she recorded ‘several seriously big underwater objects’ with sonar readings. Images have also recently emerged from a 2006 scientific trip to the lake when strange objects - one of 21ft 4in (6.5 metres) in length - were recorded on a Humminbird Piranha MAX 215 Portable fish-finder at a depth of 138 to 197 feet. Territory: Lake Labynkyr in Siberia, the alleged home of a giant 'Nesski' monster. Based on the sonic readings, researchers drew how the creature might look in real-life on the fish-finder's screen. ‘It was our fourth or fifth day at the lake when our echo sounding device registered a huge object in the water under our boat,\\" said Dr Emeliyanova of her own close encounter. It was clearly alive and too large to be one of the dozen or so known fish species in the lake. ‘The object was very dense, of homogeneous structure, surely not a fish nor a shoal of fish, and it was above the bottom,\\" she said. ‘I was very surprised but not scared nor shocked, after all we did not see this animal, we only registered a strange object in the water. But I can clearly say - at the moment, as a scientist, I cannot offer you any explanation of what this object might be.’ Lady in red: The echo device shows a mysterious shape and the scientists made a drawing, right in red, of what Nessie's Russian cousin might look like. Nesski caught: The device, normally used to find and trace fish movements discovered a strange dense object in the lake. Artists impression: The scientists have made a drawing of a not-so-happy monster on the screen. Other similar findings since her 2002 mission mean that a new scientific mission to discover the truth is essential, said Dr Emeliyanova, a biogeographer. ‘I believe there is a mystery in this lake because there is no smoke without fire,’ she said. She was told an account of two fishermen who were ‘in a 10 metre long boat when suddenly the bow began to rise as if somebody was pushing it from under the water. 'It was a heavy boat, only a huge and strong animal can do such a thing. The fishermen were stuck by fear. They did not see anything, no head, no jaws.’ Another 'sighting' came when a group of Russian geologists were fishing in the lake. ‘Suddenly those in the boat started screaming - apparently they saw a huge head of some creature. Others, who were waiting for them on shore, started shooting, and scared the creature away,’ said a witness. Monster or myth?: The local population have given testimonies on the monster they call 'the Devil' since the 19th century. A 1953 sighting of a 'monster' in neighbouring Lake Vorota by respected Soviet geologist Viktor Tverdokhlebov was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities. But now Dr Emeliyanova wants to investigate a theory that the two lakes are linked by underground tunnels. Strangely, despite being close to Oymyakon, the coldest inhabited town on Earth, the lake does not freeze completely in winter. There has been speculation in Russia that Labynkyr and Vorota might be inhabited by a school of ichthyosaurs, prehistoric marine reptiles resembling dolphins or sharks, or plesiosaurs, a popular theory concerning 'Nessie' in Scotland which is often depicted with a long neck.

Returning from a Hong Kong business trip, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago to rendezvous with a former lover before returning to her family in Minneapolis. She appears to have contracted a cold during her trip. Her six-year-old son from a previous marriage, Clark, also becomes sick and is sent home from school. Beth's condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures. Her husband, Mitch, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that Clark has also died from a similar infection. Mitch is placed in isolation, but seems to be immune to the disease. He is released and returns home to his teenage daughter Jory, though they are unsure if she's inherited his immunity. She decides to stay with her father regardless. Mitch struggles with learning his wife was unfaithful, and protecting his daughter from infection. Meanwhile, everyone who had contact with Emhoff begins to spread the disease around the world. In Atlanta, representatives of the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the CDC and fear that the disease is a bio weapon terror attack over the Thanksgiving weekend. Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the outbreak to Emhoff, but after setting up triage camps in large venues, Dr. Mears becomes infected. Her evacuation is postponed, as airports close ahead of a quarantine. She later dies and is buried in a mass grave. As more and more people become infected with no cure in sight, social order begins to decay, with rampant looting of stores and homes. The U.S. President is moved underground while emergency services suffer absenteeism and no longer respond. Mitch and Jory attempt to escape to Wisconsin, but the borders are closed.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Record numbers of A-level students 'to be rejected from university' By Graeme Paton and Rachel Cooper Published: 10:00PM BST 26 Jun 2009 Research by The Daily Telegraph suggests demand for degree courses has surged by almost 65,000, even though few extra places are available. With the deadline for applications looming on Tuesday, numbers are believed to be up 11 per cent across Britain. The Conservatives warned a \\"major crisis\\" was looming as thousands more people push for university amid dire warnings of long-term job shortages. Vice-chancellors admitted entrance criteria would be dramatically tightened up, with the number of places handed out through clearing slumping to a new low. Many students missing conditional offers by a single grade, who would have been accepted in the past, could now be rejected, they said. More straight-A candidates will also miss out as the most sought-after universities fall back on interviews and entrance tests to find the best candidates. Universities have already been warned they face fines for over-recruiting this year. The pressure on places has been fuelled by a sharp rise in applications from mature students. Cambridge's four colleges which cater exclusively for over-21s all reported significant rises, with St Edmund's alone reporting a 52 per cent increase. But the Commons skills select committee warned this week that only 3,000 extra places across Britain would be made available in September - potentially leaving more than 60,000 without a place. This is on top of some 110,000 rejected every year after failing to meet entry requirements, applying too late or dropping out of the process. Amanda Brook, head of student recruitment at Exeter, said: \\"We have certainly had to reject more students who did not meet our AAA offers as we were only able to make offers at the very top of the range. Inevitably we will have to be stricter with those who miss their offer.\\" Professor Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire University, said: \\"We could see tens of thousands of students missing out on a place at their preferred university because they have missed their offer by one or two grades. Universities are going to be more nervous about letting people in.\\" Roderick Smith, admissions director at Birmingham, said there was a nine per cent rise overall, including a 65 per cent rise in the number of students studying economics. \\"In previous years, about 80 per cent of applicants would have been made an offer for that subject, but now only half of applicants will be made an offer,\\" he said. \\"We are having to assess people much more rigorously because we know we can't take more people. We're looking for the best students, with the best academic record and the right combination of A-levels. We're most definitely having to reject people who in the past would have been made an offer.\\" The ultimate deadline for applications is the end of June. Last year, 588,689 people applied for full time undergraduate courses. After accounting for students failing to make the grade or rejecting offers, a total of 456,627 gained places. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) warned that applications were up by almost nine per cent by the end of March compared to the same period in 2008. But research by The Telegraph suggests numbers have surged further in the last three months. A survey of 50 institutions shows an average 11 per cent rise which would result in 64,755 extra applicants this year. The research covered a range of small, specialist universities, former polytechnics and elite institutions. It follows pressure from Labour on teenagers to go on to university in recent years, combined with the lack of unskilled jobs for school-leavers in recession. Ministers originally promised 10,000 additional places would be created this year. But Phil Willis, chairman of the Commons skills select committee, said only 3,000 would be available for full-time undergraduates. Other places are likely to go to part-time students, while money is also used by universities who over-recruited last year. Newer universities, many of which specialise in work-based courses leading directly to a job, experienced the biggest rises. Bedfordshire reported a 28 per cent increase and applications to Portsmouth were up 23 per cent. Buckinghamshire New University reported a 33 per cent rise. Popular universities, such as Exeter and Leicester, saw applications rise 18 per cent while Oxford increased by 12 per cent. Applications soared among mature students, many of whom have been left without work in the recession - potentially squeezing out those joining straight from school or college. Worcestershire University reported a 37 per cent increase in applications from mature students. David Willetts, the Conservative shadow skills secretary, said: \\"Photos on A-level results day of pretty young women jumping for joy after receiving their A-level results will probably be replaced the next day with pictures of the same people in tears because they can't get into university. We have a major crisis looming and we'll have many students with very good A-level grades missing out.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \\"Next year there will be more students going to university than ever before, taking advantage of the record number of funded places on offer. There will be 40,000 more accepted applicants than just three years ago – and right now there are 300,000 more students in system since 1997. \\"Getting a place at university has always been, and should be, a competitive process. But there are a variety of options on offer for young people, including part-time study, apprenticeships and foundation degrees.\\"","completion":"This news article is about how many students who want to go to university might not be able to because there are not enough spots available. The number of people applying to college has gone up a lot, but the number of spots in the colleges hasn't changed too much. This means that even really smart students who could have gone to college before might not be accepted now. The government said there would be some extra spots, but not enough for everyone who wants to go. People who want to study part-time or learn a skill through a special program might have a better chance of finding a place to study."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Laura's heart pounded in her chest as she stared at the barrel of the gun, mere inches away from Felicia's temple. Although the weapon wasn't directed at her, Laura was acutely aware that a single twitch of the gunman's finger could mean instantaneous death for her best friend. The three of them stood in the dimly lit alley, their shadows casting eerie patterns on the damp pavement. Felicia's eyes were wide with fear, her face draining of color as her gaze remained fixed on the cold steel pressed against her skull. The gunman, a tall man with piercing blue eyes and a weathered face that hinted at years of hardship and cruelty, locked eyes with Laura. He sneered, his voice dripping with malice. \\"What's it gonna be, kid?\\" he growled, nodding toward the small bag of diamonds that lay on the ground between Laura and Felicia. The diamonds had been their ticket out of the slums. They had planned their heist meticulously, analyzing and plotting every move for months before finally carrying it out. The high-end jewelry store in the heart of the city had only been the beginning; what they hadn't anticipated was the wrath of a notorious crime boss who held a stake in the store's profits. Now, with the lives swaying precariously in the balance, Laura was faced with an unthinkable decision. She glanced at the precious stones and then at Felicia, swallowing hard. \\"Take the diamonds, please,\\" Laura managed to choke out, struggling to keep her voice steady. \\"Just don't hurt her.\\" The gunman's eyes sparkled with cruel amusement as he extended his left hand to pick up the bag of diamonds, while his right hand maintained a firm grip on the gun. \\"You made a wise choice,\\" he said with an evil grin. He took a step back, keeping the gun trained on Felicia. \\"Now, I hope you both learned your lesson.\\" For a split second, Laura thought she saw an opportunity. A fleeting chance to disarm the man and reclaim their stolen prize. But the risk was monumental; if she failed, Felicia would pay the price. With a deep breath, Laura forced her body to relax, making a conscious effort to ignore the searing outrage coursing through her veins. She watched helplessly as the gunman tucked the bag of diamonds into his coat and adjusted the weapon against Felicia's head. This was it; they would leave the alley empty-handed and broken, never to taste the freedom they had so desperately sought. But fate had other plans. As the gunman was about to turn and walk away, Felicia suddenly swung her elbow, connecting it with the man's ribs. The unexpected blow caught him by surprise, causing the gun to misfire and skid out of his grasp. The three of them froze, momentarily stunned by the turn of events. Laura leapt into action, grabbing the gun before the man had time to react. She aimed it at him, her hands shaking as she snarled through gritted teeth. \\"No more playing games. This ends now.\\" The criminal sneered, his eyes flicking between Laura and Felicia, before ultimately landing on the weapon in Laura's grasp. Seeing that he had no way to gain the upper hand, he raised his hands in surrender. \\"Fine,\\" he spat, venom tainting his voice. \\"Enjoy your tainted victory. I won't be far behind.\\" The girls exchanged hurried glances as the man backed away, his gaze remaining on the gun leveled at him. As soon as he had vanished from sight, they bolted in the opposite direction, adrenaline coursing through their veins. It wasn't the outcome they had envisioned, but through their strength and determination, Laura and Felicia escaped with their lives.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the names of the two overdrive pedals used by Mudhoney?, using the article: Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".

Based in Toronto, Ontario, the team was founded in 1873, and is the oldest existing professional sports team in North America still using its original name. The team's origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre from 1989 until 2016 when the team moved to BMO Field, the fifth stadium site to host the team. The current team is coached by Scott Milanovich and led at quarterback by Ricky Ray. - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century.

Q:Question: \\"What plays the biggest part in keeping a bird light enough to fly?\\" Context: \\"Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The biggest part in keeping a bird light enough to fly is their lightweight skeleton. This, along with adaptations such as large flight muscles (pectoralis and supracoracoideus), modified forelimbs (wings) that serve as aerofoils, and specific wing shapes and sizes contribute to their ability to maintain flight efficiently.

The key function is a lambda function that takes each dictionary as an argument and returns a tuple with two elements, the first is the value of the 'first' key and the second is the value of the 'second' key. 3. The sorted function takes the tuples returned by the key function and compares them one by one. Since comparison of tuples is element-wise, it first compares the values for the 'first' key and if they are equal, it moves on to compare the values for the 'second' key. 4. The sorted function returns the list of dictionaries sorted by their 'first' key from smallest to largest. In case of equal 'first' key values, it sorts them by their 'second' key. 5. Negative numbers are already considered smaller than positive numbers during comparison, so they automatically come before positive numbers in the sorting process.

Article: Do you know why different animals or pests have their special colors? Colors in them seem to be used mainly to protect themselves.

When crops are green, locusts look green. But as the harvest time comes, locusts change to the same brown color as crops have. Some other pests with different colors from plants are easily found and eaten by others. So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night. If you study the animal life, you'll find the main use of coloring is protecting themselves. Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests. They cannot be seen by hunters.

A navy of 10,000 vessels, including Pecheneg allies, landed on the Bithynian coast and devastated the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus’ burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with Greek fire throwers and sent them out to meet the Rus’, luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire. Liutprand of Cremona wrote that \\"the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire.\\" Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus’ fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as Nicomedia, with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack). The outcome indicates increased military might by Byzantium since 911, suggesting a shift in the balance of power. Why did the attack by the Rus go so well on the coast at the start?","completion":"Okay little buddy, let me explain this to you. A long time ago, in the year 941, there was a group called the Rus. They had a big leader named Igor, and they wanted to attack a place called Constantinople. They did this because they wanted to have the right to trade things with other people. So, the Rus gathered up a really big group of ships, about 10,000 of them, and they had some friends called the Pechenegs to help them too. They chose the perfect time to attack because the people in Constantinople, called the Byzantines, were busy fighting other battles. Their ships were far away in another sea, and their soldiers were in a different place too. Because of this great timing, the Rus easily arrived on the shore and began destroying cities and hurting people. The people who lived there weren't ready to fight, so it was easier for the Rus to hurt them. That's why the attack went so well for the Rus at the start."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sent 2: It is the right message, sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive about the disappointing quality of the work so far. Sent 3: The governor, like Mayor Michael Bloomberg, now seems committed to creating a better mix of uses for ground zero, and a 24-hour community in Manhattan's downtown. Sent 4: While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Sent 5: New York cannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed. Sent 6: Pataki openly questioned the Port Authority's requirement that any plan for the site replace all the office, hotel and retail square footage lost in the attack on Sept. 11. Sent 7: More than anything else, that specification limited the designs to the undistinguished options presented two weeks ago. Sent 8: Renegotiating that issue with the World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately. Sent 9: Opening the process to other designers, both here and internationally, will help separate this urban plan from the ordinary. Sent 10: The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground, in particular with the transportation network. Sent 11: At this point, planners have focused on short-term repair of PATH and subway lines, with medium-range proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown. Sent 12: Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region. Sent 13: Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals. Sent 14: But it would be expensive, and the governor, the mayor and their friends in Washington will have to look at long-range ways to pay the bill. Sent 15: Pataki's recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy. Sent 16: Now he needs to follow through with action, to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best possible plan, not simply keeping the issue on hold until after this fall's election.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you are experiencing back pain and want to use an ice pack to relieve it, you can either make an ice pack or purchase one. From commercial packs to bags of frozen vegetables, any choice you make can help you alleviate discomfort and reduce inflammation. You can purchase commercial ice packs specifically designed for the back at many pharmacies and medical supply stores. Make a slushy ice pack by pouring three cups (710 ml) of water and one cup (237 ml) of denatured alcohol in a large freezer bag. Wrap it inside another freezer bag to avoid spilling. Place it in the freezer until it is a slushy consistency. You can put small ice cubes or crushed ice in a plastic bag to make an ice pack. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables, which may nicely fit the contours of your back. Before you apply your ice pack, wrap it in a towel or cloth. Not only can this keep you from getting wet and keep the pack in place, but may also protect your skin from becoming numb or getting ice burn or even frostbite. It’s especially important to wrap a commercial blue ice pack in a towel. These are colder than frozen water and can cause frostbite. You want to be comfortable while you ice your back. Finding a comfortable place where you can lie or sit can help you relax, relieve discomfort, and get the full benefits of icing. It may be easier to lie down while icing your back. Be sure to keep your knees slightly bent to relieve pressure off of your lower back. You can also place an ice pack on a chair and hold it in place by wedging it between your back and the chair back. You may need to add a towel between the ice pack and the chair so it doesn’t slip around. Once you’re comfortable, place the ice pack on the area of your back that is causing you pain. This may offer you some immediate pain relief and reduce inflammation that is exacerbating your discomfort. Keep the pack on the affected area for no more than 20 minutes per session. Less than 10 minutes may be ineffective but too much time can cause damage, so shoot for 15-20 minutes. Doing it for longer than 20 minutes can damage skin (cryoburn) and underlying tissues. You can use the ice pack after activity or exercise, but don’t use it beforehand. This may prevent your brain from receiving important pain signals to stop. If your pack doesn’t cover the entire area causing you pain, you can do spot ice treatments to get relief. Practice relaxing and taking deep breaths while you’re using the ice pack to relieve more tension. Use a guided meditation if it helps you feel more therapeutic effects. You can also use elastic wrap or shrink wrap to hold the pack in place. Try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever along with your ice treatments. Using this combination may relieve your pain more quickly and also help control inflammation. Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen sodium to help relieve your back pain. NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium may also help relieve inflammation. Ice is most effective for back pain in the days immediately following when you first notice pain. Keep applying the ice until you no longer have pain, or see a doctor if it persists. You can ice your back up to five times a day with at least 45 minutes in between treatments. The continued icing keeps your tissue temperatures low and may help reduce inflammation and pain. Consult with your doctor if icing doesn’t help after a week or your pain becomes unbearable.

State governments, coastal cities, and local authorities have been put on high alert, engaging in disaster management plans to ensure public safety and minimize potential damage to properties and infrastructure. Formed in the Pacific Ocean, Tropical Storm Frank has been closely monitored by meteorologists and weather agencies, who predict that it may intensify further as it approaches Mexico. With sustained wind speeds of up to 60 miles per hour (95 kilometers per hour), the storm poses a significant threat to the country's western coastline. Frank is expected to produce heavy rainfall, dangerous storm surges, strong winds, and flash flooding in affected areas. The NMS has extended warnings to include all coastal areas of the Mexican states of Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco, with the possibility of extending these alerts to neighboring regions if the storm shifts course. In the meantime, state governments are collaborating with local authorities to develop and implement evacuation plans, prepare emergency shelters, and distribute supplies to at-risk communities. Residents are being urged not to underestimate the power of the storm and to take all necessary precautions in anticipation of its arrival. In response to the approaching storm, tourism authorities in Mexico have issued travel advisories for tourists planning to visit the affected areas. They advise against non-essential travel to these regions until the storm has dissipated and cleanup efforts have concluded. Vacationers currently in the affected regions are urged to stay informed about the developing weather conditions and to abide by any warnings or evacuation orders issued by the local authorities. Cruise lines and airlines serving these destinations have been alerted to the potential for cancellations or delays, and travelers should consult with their providers for information on schedule changes and refund policies. Tropical Storm Frank's encroachment upon the Mexican coast also raises concerns over possible economic and environmental impacts. Agriculture, a vital industry in these coastal states, may suffer damage to crops due to flooding and high winds. The storm may further disrupt fishing and marine operations, leading to a decrease in the supply of fresh seafood and placing pressure on local industries. To mitigate the environmental impact of the storm, clean-up crews stand ready to address possible oil spills, debris, or other disruptions to coastal ecosystems. In the current hurricane season, Tropical Storm Frank serves as a stark reminder of the potentially destructive power of nature. As warnings are extended in preparation for the storm's landfall, it is crucial for governments, communities, and individuals to work together to minimize the hazards associated with this weather event. It is hoped that with effective planning, prompt action, and public cooperation, the human and material toll of Tropical Storm Frank can be minimized and lasting harm prevented."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She became a feature writer for the Office of War Information, and then a reporter for Amerika, a publication of the U.S. State Department. While working there she met Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., a Columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for Grumman. They married in 1944. Together they had a daughter, Burgin, and two sons, James and Ned. They bought a three-story building at 555 Hudson St. Jane continued to write for Amerika after the war, while Robert left Grumman and resumed work as an architect. The Jacobses rejected the rapidly growing suburbs as \\"parasitic\\", choosing to remain in Greenwich Village. They renovated their house, in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area, and created a garden in the backyard. Working for the State Department during the McCarthy era, Jacobs received a questionnaire about her political beliefs and loyalties. Jacobs was anti-communist, and had left the Federal Workers Union because of its apparent communist sympathies. Nevertheless, she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of Saul Alinsky; therefore she was under suspicion. On March 25, 1952, Jacobs delivered a now-famous response to Conrad E. Snow, chairman of the Loyalty Security Board at the United States Department of State. In her foreword to her answer, she said: The other threat to the security of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe ...

Background: Ryan was born in Refugio, south of Victoria in south Texas, the youngest of six children, to Lynn Nolan Ryan Sr. (1907-1970), and the former Martha Lee Hancock (1913-1990). The senior Ryan operated a newspaper delivery service for the Houston Post that required him to rise in the early morning hours to prepare 1,500 newspapers for delivery over a 55-mile route. The children were expected to help with the daily tasks. Context: Nolan Ryan's post-retirement business interests include ownership of two minor league teams: the Corpus Christi Hooks, which play in the Class AA Texas League, and the Round Rock Express, a Class AAA team in the Pacific Coast League. Both teams were affiliates of the Houston Astros, for whom Ryan also served as a special assistant to the general manager until selling his interest in the team in the off-season between 2004 and 2005. He became the president of the Texas Rangers in 2008. The Express became the Rangers' AAA affiliate beginning in 2010; the Hooks are still the Astros' AA affiliate and were purchased by the Astros in 2013 when Nolan's son, Reid Ryan, took office as President of the Houston Astros. Ryan threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the 2005 World Series between the Astros and the White Sox, the first World Series game ever played in Texas. That game went 14 innings, equaling the longest in innings in World Series history (at 5:41, it was the longest in time). ESPN wryly suggested the Astros might have needed to pull the 58-year-old Ryan out of retirement if the game had gone much longer. Ryan has co-written six books: autobiographies Miracle Man (with Jerry Jenkins, 1992), Throwing Heat (with Harvey Frommer, 1988) and The Road to Cooperstown (with Mickey Herskowitz and T.R. Sullivan, 1999); Kings of the Hill (with Mickey Herskowitz, 1992), about contemporary pitchers; and instructional books Pitching and Hitting (with Joe Torre and Joel Cohen, 1977), and Nolan Ryan's Pitcher's Bible (with Tom House, 1991). In addition to his baseball activities, Ryan was majority owner and chairman of Express Bank of Alvin but sold his interest in 2005. He also owned a restaurant in Three Rivers, Texas. He served on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission from 1995 to 2001. He appeared as a TV spokesman for Advil for several years, promoting the pain medication he recommended for his own arm. He also has appeared in various television commercials shown in the Texas market. After retiring from baseball, Ryan teamed up with the federal government to promote physical fitness. His likeness was used in the \\"Nolan Ryan Fitness Guide\\", published by The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in 1994. Ryan suffered a heart attack on April 25, 2000, and had to receive a double coronary bypass. Question: what did he retire from?

Elizabeth Stewart, a former fashion editor for Women’s Wear Daily and the New York Times, was named as Tinsletown’s most influential behind-the-scenes fashion tastemaker – beating well-known red carpet stylists like Rachel Zoe and Kate Young. In addition to the two Oscar nominees, Ms Stewart also counts Amanda Seyfried, Frieda Pinto, and January Jones as clients. Elizabeth Stewart (pictured) has been named the most powerful stylist in Hollywood for her work with Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, and Julia Roberts. These looks on Cate Blanchett (left) and Julia Roberts (right) are the handiwork of Ms Stewart. This awards show cycle saw her styling 102 red carpet looks in total, with Ms Blanchett’s sequined Armani Oscars gown and Ms Robert’s widely-disputed Valentino jumpsuit for the SAGs among them.

Bagge , a student of Werner Heisenberg for his doctorate and Habilitation , was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War . He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser - Wilhelm - Institut für Physik in Berlin . Bagge , who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948 , was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels , and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship - Building and Seafare . The first German nuclear vessel , the \`\` NS Otto Hahn '' , was launched in 1962 . A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons . - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a branch of physics which is the fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles. Classical physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (Uncertainty principle). - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 \\"for the creation of quantum mechanics\\". - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. Long part of one of the Thuringian states of the Wettin line, it joined Bavaria by popular vote only in 1920. Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840. As a result of these close links with the royal houses of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Coburg was frequently visited by the crowned heads of Europe and their families. - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it. - Max Born (11 December 1882 5 January 1970) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\\". - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. - Ernst Pascual Jordan (18 October 1902 31 July 1980) was a theoretical and mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. While the Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, it has found other mathematical applications. - Neustadt bei Coburg (also written \\"Neustadt b. Coburg\\") is a town in the district of Coburg in northern Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 15 km northeast of Coburg, as its name indicates. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. - Otto Hahn, , (8 March 1879 28 July 1968) was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He was exclusively awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for the discovery and the radiochemical proof of nuclear fission. He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry. - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands, \\"for his discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions.\\" Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'occupation' with 'physicist'.

Please answer the following question: Two women go into a doctor's office for a routine physical. As is usual for a physical, the doctor takes a blood sample from both women to analyze for any issues. Upon looking at the blood, the doctor notices that Jan's platelet count is low, but other than that her blood is fine. Marcia's platelet count is not low and she has no other issues. Which woman is less likely to have hemophilia? A:","completion":"Before answering the question, let's first understand what hemophilia is and its relationship with platelet count. Hemophilia is a genetic bleeding disorder that affects the body's ability to clot blood properly. It is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of clotting factors, specifically factor VIII (Hemophilia A) or factor IX (Hemophilia B). These clotting factors help blood to clot and are essential for preventing and stopping bleeding, especially after an injury. Hemophilia is more common in males than in females, as it is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning that males with the affected gene on their X chromosome will express the condition, while females with one affected gene usually become carriers. Now, let's discuss platelet counts and their role in blood clotting. Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small cell fragments that play a crucial role in blood clotting. When an injury occurs and a blood vessel is damaged, platelets gather around the site of the injury and clump together to form a clot to prevent excessive bleeding. A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A low platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, can increase the risk of bleeding, but it is caused by factors unrelated to hemophilia, such as bone marrow disorders, certain medications, or an autoimmune condition. In this scenario, Jan has a low platelet count, while Marcia's platelet count is within the normal range. However, a low platelet count is not indicative of hemophilia, as hemophilia is caused by a deficiency in clotting factors, not a deficiency in platelets. Therefore, having a low platelet count does not make Jan more likely to have hemophilia. Since both women have no other issues with their blood, and given the information provided, there is no basis for determining that one woman is less likely to have hemophilia than the other. It is important to note that, in general, women are less likely to have hemophilia than men due to the nature of the genetic inheritance, but without further information, it is not possible to definitively say which woman mentioned is less likely to have hemophilia. The platelet count difference does not provide enough evidence to make this determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Traffic is still an important indicator of a good business, whether with or without SecondLife search. Make this lower case.","completion":"Giving away a few Linden Dollars can serve multiple purposes in Second Life, a virtual world where users can socialize, create, and trade using the in-world currency called Linden Dollars (L). One of the main reasons users may choose to give away Linden Dollars is to draw attention and promote their in-world offers, products, or services. By giving away Linden Dollars, they can effectively generate interest and encourage other users to explore their offerings. Traffic is a crucial component in the success of any business, both in the real world and within virtual platforms such as Second Life. A higher traffic volume within a virtual shop or service implies that more users are visiting and interacting with the establishment, which can lead to increased sales and better brand exposure. Second Life tracks the number of users visiting a location within a particular time frame and labels this metric as \\"traffic\\" in the search results. Many businesses in Second Life aim to increase their traffic numbers, as it directly influences the visibility and search ranking of their location. A higher search ranking can attract even more visitors, creating a cycle that, in turn, increases brand exposure and sales. To give away Linden Dollars effectively, consider these strategies: 1. Host promotions and events: Announce special promotions or host events that offer Linden Dollars as rewards or giveaways. This will entice users to visit your location and participate in the activities, ultimately increasing traffic and potential revenue. 2. Offer incentives to loyal customers: Reward long-term or loyal patrons with occasional Linden Dollar incentives. This recognition not only keeps them engaged but also encourages their peers to visit and potentially become loyal customers themselves. 3. Collaborate with other businesses: Partner with other in-world establishments to cross-promote your location and jointly give and receive Linden Dollar incentives. This collaboration expands your reach, and by combining resources, both businesses can experience increased traffic. 4. Use social media and groups: Leverage the power of social media and in-world groups to announce your Linden Dollar giveaways. This helps in reaching a wider audience and ensures that maximum users are aware of your promotions. 5. Track the results: Monitor the impact of your efforts on traffic levels and sales. By evaluating the data, you can finetune your strategies and determine the most effective ways to distribute Linden Dollars to boost your business. To summarize, giving away Linden Dollars in Second Life can serve as a powerful tool for generating traffic and expanding awareness of your products or services. By offering promotions and incentives that incorporate Linden Dollars, you can create a positive cycle of increased traffic and revenue, boosting your business's success within the virtual realm of Second Life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?' Winslow shook his head. He'd gained weight in his face recently and his jowls vibrated with the gesture.

It's the most widely spoken and officially recognized language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. Additionally, it's one of the three official languages of Luxembourg and a co-official language in the Opole Voivodeship in Poland. As for the dialects of German, they vary vastly from place to place, with certain dialects being practically unreachable to most standard German speakers. However, the standardized form, Hochdeutsch, is widely taught in schools and commonly used in formal settings, the media, and literature. And about German literature, it possesses a rich historical tradition with significant contributions from renowned figures such as Thomas Mann, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller. Furthermore, the German language is known for constructing long, compound words due to its morphological structure. It's reported that there's no limit on how long these compounds can be, and they often result in vocabulary that very precisely describes a specific concept or phenomenon. For example, \\"Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft,\\" which is recognized by the Guinness World Records as the longest German word in everyday use, translates to \\"Association for Subordinate Officials of the Main Maintenance Building of the Danube Steam Shipping Electrical Services.\\" Your provided text roughly translates to: \\"Since this is the case, and since President Berlusconi has expressed that a number of critical points that were previously there have been positively dealt with in Brussels - 82 points were mentioned - it would be sensible to consolidate this now to maintain the momentum.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In diesem Zusammenhang betont die Aussage die verantwortungsvolle Rolle, die Europa spielen kann, um sowohl in ihren eigenen Ländern als auch auf globaler Ebene Standards wie Respekt, Menschenrechte und Gerechtigkeit zu fördern und aufrechtzuerhalten. Durch die Bekämpfung der Anstandslücke zeigt Europa seine Bereitschaft, eine Führungsrolle bei der Schaffung einer gerechteren Welt zu übernehmen und dazu beizutragen, dass bestimmte international akzeptierte Normen von Anstand und Gerechtigkeit eingehalten werden. Dabei geht es unter anderem darum, dass Europa seine Ressourcen und Fachkompetenzen zur Verfügung stellt, um gemeinsam mit anderen Ländern und internationalen Organisationen zusammenzuarbeiten und auf diese Weise eine positive Veränderung und Entwicklung zu ermöglichen.

The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi). Charnier plans to smuggle 32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, French television personality Henri Devereaux (FrÃ©dÃ©ric de Pasquale). In New York City, detectives Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy \\"Cloudy\\" Russo (Roy Scheider) are conducting an undercover stakeout in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. After seeing a drug transaction take place in a bar, Cloudy goes in to make an arrest, but the suspect makes a break for it, cutting Cloudy on the arm with a knife.

My question: Why does Charnier want to conclude the deal quickly? A:","completion":"Charnier wants to conclude the deal quickly for several reasons. Firstly, the drug trade, particularly at the level of an international heroin-smuggling syndicate, is a high-risk business. The longer it takes to finalize a deal, the more time law enforcement has to catch wind of the operation and potentially disrupt or dismantle it. By moving quickly, Charnier can minimize the likelihood of drawing attention to his criminal activities, whether from rival criminals or law enforcement. Secondly, in the underworld of drug trafficking, reputation is crucial. Charnier has been successful so far as a wealthy French criminal running the largest heroin-smuggling syndicate in the world, and to maintain that position, he must continue to demonstrate his ability to conduct transactions efficiently and effectively. A swift and successful deal will not only keep his current customers satisfied but also attract new clients who seek a reliable and discreet supplier. Furthermore, time is money in the illegal drug trade, and the quicker Charnier can turn over his product, the faster he can reinvest his profits into new shipments, contacts, or infrastructure that can help expand and solidify his criminal empire. A speedy deal allows Charnier to maintain a continuous flow of income and reinvest profits to stay ahead of his competition and law enforcement. Additionally, Charnier's plan to smuggle the heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, French television personality Henri Devereaux, adds a degree of time sensitivity to the operation. Charnier must work within the constraints of Devereaux's schedule and make sure the heroin is transported and offloaded before Devereaux becomes aware of the illicit cargo or before anyone connected to Devereaux has a chance to uncover the hidden drugs. Lastly, Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli, has assassinated an undercover detective in Marseille. This act could attract significant unwanted attention from law enforcement agencies, both in France and internationally. With increased scrutiny on Charnier's activities, it is crucial for him to conclude the deal as promptly as possible before authorities can connect the dots and link him and his operation to the murder. In conclusion, Charnier wants to conclude the deal quickly to minimize risks, maintain his reputation, maximize profits, work within the constraints of his smuggling plan, and avoid detection by law enforcement, especially in light of the recent assassination of an undercover detective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Context_1 : Griffon is a steel Dive Coaster roller coaster located at the Busch Gardens Williamsburg amusement park in James City County, Virginia, United States. Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, it is 205 ft high, and is the second-fastest (71 mph ) Dive Coaster built. The roller coaster features two Immelmann loops, a splashdown, two vertical drops and was the first of its kind to use floorless trains. Griffon was announced to the public on August 23, 2006 and opened on May 18, 2007 to positive reviews by both newspapers and enthusiasts. In 2007, \\"Amusement Today\\"' s annual Golden Ticket Awards voted it the third-best new steel roller coaster of that year and the 27th-best steel roller coaster. It was voted the 33rd-best steel roller coaster in 2013. Context_2 : Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (formerly known as Six Flags Marine World, Marine World, The New Marine World Theme Park, and Marine World Africa USA) is a 135-acre (55 ha) animal theme park located in Vallejo, California, roughly halfway between San Francisco and Sacramento on Interstate 80. The park includes a variety of roller coasters and other amusement rides. Discovery Kingdom has been part of the Six Flags chain of amusement parks since 1999. Context_3 : Tatsu is a steel flying roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park located in Valencia, California, United States. Announced on November 17, 2005, the roller coaster opened to the public on May 13, 2006 as the park's seventeenth roller coaster. Tatsu reaches a height of 170 ft and speeds up to 62 mph . The ride's name means \\"Flying Beast\\" in Japanese. The roller coaster is also the world's tallest and fastest flying coaster; is the only flying roller coaster to feature a zero-gravity roll; and has the world's highest pretzel loop. It was the world's longest flying coaster until The Flying Dinosaur surpassed it. Context_4 : Intimidator is a steel roller coaster built by Bolliger & Mabillard at Carowinds. The roller coaster is located in the Celebration Plaza section of the park on the former site of the Wild Thornberry's River Adventure log flume ride. Intimidator is the thirteenth roller coaster installed at Carowinds and is located near the entrance of the theme park. It is currently one of the tallest, fastest and longest roller coasters in the Southeast with a 232 ft lift hill, a top speed of 75 mph and a track length of 5316 ft . It was announced on August 26, 2009 and opened March 27, 2010. The roller coaster's name comes from the nickname of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt. Context_5 : Fujiyama is a steel roller coaster at Fuji-Q Highland, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi, Japan. When Fujiyama opened in 1996 it was the world's tallest roller coaster at 259 ft , and had the largest drop in the world at 230 ft . Fujiyama was also the world's fastest roller coaster for a year of its operation, succeeded by Tower of Terror at Dreamworld theme park in Queensland, Australia in 1997. Despite being the world's fastest roller coaster in operation for a year, Fujiyama set no world records for roller coaster speed. Steel Phantom at Kennywood set the world record for speed before engineers added additional brakes to slow the ride down because of safety and rider comfort concerns. Context_6 : Goliath is a steel Hyper Coaster located at the Six Flags Over Georgia amusement park in Cobb County, Georgia, United States. Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard it reaches a maximum height of 200 ft , a top speed of 70 mi/h , and has approximately 4480 ft of track. Great Gasp and Looping Starship were both removed by the end of the 2005 season to make room for the roller coaster. Goliath was announced to the public on September 1, 2005 and opened on April 1, 2006. In 2006, \\"Amusement Today\\"' s annual Golden Ticket Awards voted it the fourth-best new steel roller coaster of that year and the 9th-best steel roller coaster. It was voted the 7th-best steel roller coaster in 2013. Context_7 : Millennium Force is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. It was the fourteenth roller coaster to be built at the park since Blue Streak opened in 1964. Upon completion in 2000, Millennium Force broke six world records and was the world's first Giga Coaster, a roller coaster that exceeds 300 ft in height and completes a full circuit. It was briefly the tallest and fastest in the world until Steel Dragon 2000 opened later the same year. The ride is also the third-longest roller coaster in North America after The Beast at Kings Island and Fury 325 at Carowinds. It was the first roller coaster to use a cable lift system rather than a traditional chain lift. The coaster has a 310 ft , 45-degree lift hill with a 300 ft drop and features two tunnels, three overbanked turns, and four hills. It has a top speed of 93 mph . Context_8 : Kong is a steel Suspended Looping Coaster, made by Vekoma, located at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California. Context_9 : White Cyclone (ホワイトサイクロン , Howaito Saikuron ) is a wooden roller coaster at Nagashima Spa Land in Mie Prefecture, Japan. At 1700 m in length, White Cyclone is the third longest wooden roller coaster in the world, and is the longest wooden roller coaster outside of the United States. Despite its length, White Cyclone is still considerably shorter than the 2479 m Steel Dragon 2000, the world's longest steel roller coaster, which is also at Nagashima Spa Land. In addition to being the third longest wooden roller coaster, White Cyclone is the seventh tallest wooden roller coaster in the world and the fourth tallest wooden roller coaster outside the United States. A single ride on the White Cyclone costs ¥1,000 (approximately 9 USD), and the ride is restricted to those individuals above 1.3 m in height; and those individuals under 54 years of age. Context_10 : A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track. Occasionally, the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss, but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design. Because of the limits of wood, wooden roller coasters, in general, do not have inversions (when the coaster goes upside down), steep drops, or extremely banked turns (overbanked turns). However, there are exceptions; the defunct Son of Beast at Kings Island had a 214 ft drop and originally had a 90 ft loop until the end of the 2006 season, although the loop had steel supports. Other special cases are Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. The coaster features a double-track tunnel, a corkscrew, and a 90-degree banked turn. There is also The Voyage at Holiday World (an example of a wooden roller coaster with a steel structure for supports) featuring three separate 90-degree banked turns. Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park has a 90-degree banked turn, T Express at Everland in South Korea with a 77-degree drop, and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City which has 3 inversions and 120-degree overbanked turn. fact_1 : Kong is a steel Suspended Looping Coaster, made by Vekoma, located at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California. fact_2 : The park includes a variety of roller coasters and other amusement rides.

I heard that While visiting a friend, Ash got caught stealing one of their favorite toys. And I was wondering What will Ash want to do next? OPT: + steal more toys; + replace the toy; + accuse his friend of stealing; Answer:","completion":"Ash might experience a range of emotions after being caught stealing their friend's favorite toy. Given that Ash values their friendship, they would most likely choose actions that reflect an understanding of the effects of their behavior on the relationship. There are a few actions that Ash might consider, some of which could work to strengthen or weaken the friendship: 1. Apologize and admit their wrongdoing: The first thing Ash needs to do is admit that they made a mistake. This means offering a sincere and heartfelt apology to their friend. They should acknowledge how their actions hurt their friend and express genuine regret for what they did. Ash will need to take responsibility for their actions and assure their friend that it won't happen again. 2. Return the toy: Ash will need to return the stolen toy to their friend as soon as possible. This tangible act of restoring their friend's possession can help demonstrate their sincerity and commitment to making things right between them. 3. Make amends: For Ash to rebuild trust between themselves and their friend, they may want to find a way to compensate for the harm their actions caused. This could involve replacing the toy (if it was damaged or lost during the theft) or buying their friend a new toy as a gesture of goodwill. Ash could also consider other appropriate actions, such as doing something nice for their friend or spending time together to work through the issue. 4. Reflect on their behavior: Ash needs to ask themselves why they felt compelled to steal the toy in the first place. Understanding the underlying reasons, such as envy or a desire for attention, can help Ash recognize any potential patterns in their own behavior and work towards self-improvement. 5. Avoid stealing in the future: It's essential for Ash to learn from this experience and make conscious decisions not to engage in similar acts in the future. This includes resisting any temptation to steal from others and actively choosing more constructive and positive ways to cope with personal issues. 6. Strengthen the friendship: Ash could focus on ways to strengthen their bond with their friend by engaging in shared activities, being a good listener, and offering support. Demonstrating reliability and trustworthiness will be crucial in rebuilding trust between them. In summary, Ash should address the situation by apologizing, returning the toy, making amends, and reflecting on their actions. They should also commit to improving their behavior and working on their friendship to ensure a stronger and more trust-based relationship with their friend moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. They both ask about the reason behind Cyrus Mistry's removal as the chairman of Tata Sons. Cyrus Mistry was removed from the position of the chairman of Tata Sons on 24th October 2016 and replaced by Ratan Tata as the interim chairman. This unexpected ousting of Mistry created ripples in the business world as it was an unprecedented move by the conglomerate. Several factors contributed to Cyrus Mistry's removal from the position: 1. Performance Concerns: Tata Sons cited that the company's performance under Mistry's tenure was not up to the expectations. There was a decline in revenue and profits, raising concerns about the financial health of the conglomerate. The lack of satisfactory performance on various business parameters was a major reason behind his removal. 2. Leadership Style and Decision Making: Mistry's leadership style was perceived as indecisive, leading to loss of confidence by Tata Sons' board members. There were concerns about his reluctance to take bold decisions, and the slow pace of execution of critical projects, which impacted the company's growth. 3. Misalignment with Tata Values and Ethics: The Tata Group, known for its value-based and ethical approach, was believed to have experienced a deviation from these principles under Mistry's tenure. Instances such as the alleged corporate governance lapses at AirAsia India and the handling of Tata-Mistry conflict demonstrated a value misalignment with the Tata Group's philosophy, causing discomfort within the company's leadership. 4. Poor Management of Legacy Businesses: Some of the key businesses of the Tata Group, such as Tata Steel, Indian Hotels, and Tata Teleservices, had been struggling during Mistry's tenure. Tata Sons believed that the situation was not aptly managed by Cyrus Mistry, leading to further decline and harm to the group's interests. 5. Lack of Communication and Trust: Another critical issue was the lack of communication and trust between Mistry and other stakeholders of the Tata Group, particularly the Tata Trusts and its Chairman Ratan Tata. The strained relationship between the leadership ultimately led to the inability to work cohesively for the company's welfare. Following Cyrus Mistry's removal, a bitter public feud ensued between Mistry and Tata Sons, with both parties trading allegations against each other. Ultimately, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in December 2019 ruled that Mistry's removal as the chairman was illegal. However, in March 2020, the Supreme Court of India stayed the NCLAT order, and eventually, in March 2021, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tata Sons, upholding Mistry's removal as legal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This photograph, featuring a French far right politician asleep on a plane, has amassed almost 200,000 likes on Facebook and been shared more than 30,000 times. Now the man who took it is being sued, and blamed for disrupting the recent French elections. The man asleep on the right of the photo is Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of France's National Front party. The man on the left is Brahim Zaibat, a professional dancer, and one of Madonna's ex-boyfriends. Zaibat, who is half-Algerian, posted the picture on 12 December, after both men just happened to be seated near each other on a flight. The date is significant as it was the day before the second round of France's regional elections in which the National Front were hoping for a string of important victories after a strong showing in the first round. The photo appeared on Zaibat's Facebook with the accompanying message: \\"Knock out [the National Front] tomorrow by going to vote. Preserve our fraternal France!!! #Iloveit.\\" The picture was an instant hit among Zaibat's fans, who liked, shared and commented on it en masse. \\"This photo is beautiful. Long live France, it will never be the land of the far right,\\" wrote one. It spawned a lengthy debate about racism in France, and Le Pen's relevance to the party he founded. The following day the National Front - now led by Jean-Marie's daughter Marine Le Pen - failed to win a single region in the local elections in a result that surprised many commentators. Follow BBC Trending on Facebook Join the conversation on this and other stories here. Jean-Marie Le Pen has now determined that the party's failure was at least in part down to Zaibat's potentially embarrassing photo, and rallying cry. On Sunday French magazine Public reported that Le Pen is claiming €50,000 (£37,000) in damages from Zaibat, and demanding a public apology, claiming that the photo \\"harmed his image and was instrumental in the defeat of the party\\". Another French publication, Rue 89, has confirmed that Jean-Marie Le Pen is suing Zaibat for breach of privacy. If you find it unlikely that a picture of a sleeping politician could change the course of a major election, you aren't alone. The more conventional analysis is that, despite winning a significant share of the vote, rival parties worked together and stood down some of their candidates to block the National Front winning in any single region. Not only that, Jean-Marie ceded power to his daughter Marine almost five years ago now. Since then she has attempted to renew the party's image. And in August the National Front even expelled Jean-Marie Le Pen in an effort to shed its extremist reputation. French media is reporting that the first hearing of Le Pen's complaint is set to take place on 22 January. Zaibat has yet to comment publicly on the damages claim.

It's the best time to develop your skills with different people, such as teachers, classmates, and roommates. Your social skills and relationships with people in college will have an influence long after you graduate. Here are some tips on developing your people skills at college. Put yourself out there and meet new people You're very likely to make some lifelong friendships at college. But before you get there you have to start by making friends. Upperclassmen and the college itself will organize events to introduce you and your peers to each other and the new college environment. For the purpose of improving your social skills early on, attend every single one. Join clubs that fit your interests. You can meet many people there and it's a safe bet that you will have something in common. Being active on social networks, such as Renren and micro blogs, is also a good way to meet people, especially if you're not so good at face-to-face conversation. Always open yourself to conversation Your chances of making new friends depends on your ability to get a friendly atmosphere across. Simple gestures, such as moving your things from a chair when someone is looking for a place in the canteen, can make you seem more open to conversation. You can also take out your earphones when someone asks to share a table with you in the common room while you're studying. Try to get along with roommates Getting along with roommates is a challenge you'd be wise to overcome. You live together, so you will often spend time together without even trying to. It's important to make sure that dorm life doesn't make you unhappy. You should be cautious about facing your roommates over any problems, especially if you have only just met.

Animal tests showed light, equivalent to that from street lamps, could lead to tumours becoming resistant to the widely used drug Tamoxifen. The study, published in the journal Cancer Research, showed the light affected sleep hormones, which in turn altered cancer cell function. UK experts said it was an intriguing finding, but not proven in people. Tamoxifen has transformed the treatment of breast cancer by extending lives and increasing survival times. It stops the female hormone oestrogen fuelling the growth of tumours although the cancerous cells may eventually become resistant to the drug. Light Researchers at the Tulane University School of Medicine investigated the role of the body clock in Tamoxifen resistance. They focused their research on the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, which normally begins to rise in the evening and continues through the night, before falling away as dawn approaches. However, light in the evening - such as from a smartphone, tablet or artificial lights - can lower melatonin levels. Rats, with human breast cancer and treated with Tamoxifen, were left to sleep in a completely dark cage or one that had dim light. The scientists showed that in dim light, melatonin levels were lower, the tumours were bigger and were resistant to Tamoxifen. A second set of tests showed that giving those mice melatonin supplements kept Tamoxifen working and resulted in smaller tumours. Image copyright Thinkstock Dr Steven Hill told the BBC News website: \\"I'm not advocating people buy melatonin over the counter, there's not enough evidence. \\"But they could make sure they sleep in a room that is completely dark or they could wear eye-masks to let night-time melatonin rise and take Tamoxifen right before going to bed, that would be the easiest way to see if it works.\\" Some studies have suggested that melatonin may improve cancer treatments. It has been suggested that the hormone calms down cancer cells, which are working on overdrive, to slow down the processes needed to develop resistance. Dr Hill wants to move the research into human breast tissue. Evening tech He did add a warning about using technology, which tends to produce blue light wavelengths that disrupt melatonin production, in the run-up to bedtime. \\"If you get seven hours sleep at night, but use an iPad or computer or watch TV then those blue wavelengths are suppressing melatonin production for anywhere from an hour to an hour and half. \\"So instead of seven hours of melatonin, you're getting six or five and a half.\\" Dr Samuel Godfrey, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: \\"The link between developing drug-resistant breast cancer and sleeping in dim light is an intriguing one, but it's important that we remember this link was found after studying a small number of rats implanted with breast cancer cells, not humans. \\"More research in people is needed before we know whether the same mechanisms are at work in people.\\" ||||| Melatonin Other common name(s): none Scientific/medical name(s): N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine Description Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally by the pineal gland-- a pea-sized gland located just beneath the center of the brain-- in response to darkness. Melatonin is also available as a man-made supplement. Overview Research suggests that the melatonin made by the body plays a large role in the daily rhythms of sleeping and waking. Some recent studies have found that people who work night shifts may be at increased risk for cancer, which could be linked to melatonin levels in the body. Study results regarding the effect of melatonin supplements on survival and quality of life in people with cancer have been mixed, and further research in this area is needed. How is it promoted for use? There is some evidence that melatonin may have a role in the regulation of daily body cycles, sleep patterns, mood, and reproduction. Possible effects on tumor growth and aging are also under study. Melatonin is promoted mainly as a sleep aid. Its production in the body may decrease with age, which, according to proponents, may explain why many older people have trouble sleeping. Melatonin is also promoted to help people adjust to odd or irregular work schedules and to counter the effects of jet lag, as it may restore normal sleeping and waking schedules. Some practitioners also believe that melatonin influences hormones in the body that regulate reproduction, the timing of ovulation, and aging. It is sometimes promoted to prevent Alzheimer disease and is often sold as an anti-aging hormone. Proponents also claim that melatonin is a powerful anti-oxidant, a compound that blocks the action of free radicals, activated oxygen molecules that can damage cells. Because of melatonin's suspected antioxidant properties, some believe it may suppress the growth of some types of cancer cells, especially when combined with certain anti-cancer drugs. Some supporters suggest that melatonin may also stimulate a type of white blood cell called natural killer cells, which attack tumors. Others suggest that melatonin levels and daily body cycles are abnormal in some people with cancer and that melatonin supplements may help them sleep at night. There are also claims that melatonin may decrease the toxic effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. What does it involve? Melatonin is sold as a supplement and is available in drugstores, health food stores, and over the Internet. There are no widely accepted recommendations for dosage or duration of use. Melatonin can also be found in many foods, such as milk, peanuts, almonds, turkey, and chicken, but in such small amounts that one would have to eat very large volumes to obtain a measurable dose. What is the history behind it? The existence of the pineal gland has been known for thousands of years, although its function remained a mystery until the late 20th century. In the 1600s, the French philosopher René Descartes called the pineal gland \\"the seat of the soul,\\" because many people believed emotions originated there. Researchers at Yale University first discovered melatonin and its connection to the pineal gland in the late 1950s. Its link to sleep and hormonal influences and its possible link to cancer have been studied since that time. Melatonin became available as a dietary supplement in the 1990s. What is the evidence? Some recent research has suggested that low melatonin levels in the body may be linked to a higher risk of certain types of cancer. For example, a few studies have found that women who work night shifts for many years (and therefore would be expected to have lower levels of melatonin) seem to have a slightly higher risk of breast and colorectal cancer. Even if this research is confirmed, however, it does not necessarily mean that melatonin supplements can lower cancer risk. Melatonin has been shown to slow or stop the growth of several types of cancer cells when studied in the laboratory. Whether this same effect occurs in the body is unknown. Several studies have looked at the use of melatonin to treat cancer. Melatonin has been used alone and combined with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy (such as tamoxifen), or immunotherapy (such as interleukin-2) in a number of studies involving different types of cancer. Some of the studies have suggested that melatonin may extend survival and improve quality of life for patients with certain types of untreatable cancers such as advanced lung cancer and melanoma. Some studies reported that a small number of cancers went into total or partial remission, while other studies indicated that melatonin caused little or no response in tumors. In a 2005 clinical trial looking at cancer-related weight loss (cachexia), melatonin was compared to fish oil in a small group of patients with advanced intestinal cancer. Although neither group gained weight on these substances, three of the eleven patients in the melatonin group did not lose more weight over the 4 week trial period. However, this study was limited by its small size and short period of follow up, and other factors may have accounted for the more stable weight in these patients. Most of the studies reporting positive results from melatonin were small and conducted by the same group of Italian researchers. Before the results are widely accepted, they will need to be confirmed in larger studies at other centers. Some early studies have reported that melatonin may improve appetite, blood platelet counts, and mouth sores in people undergoing chemotherapy. But a study of melatonin's ability to ease the effects of chemotherapy on the blood counts of lung cancer patients found that high doses of the hormone had little effect. More research is needed to clarify these results. There is relatively good evidence that melatonin supplements can influence sleep and fatigue and can help with jet lag and some sleep problems. Research has not yet shown the most effective way to use melatonin supplements for patients with sleep disorders or for people who have trouble sleeping occasionally. Some research shows that melatonin affects not only how quickly people fall asleep but also the duration and quality of sleep. Are there any possible problems or complications? There appear to be few short-term side effects from taking melatonin. Some people report headaches or feeling drowsy or confused after taking it. People taking high doses have reported nightmares and trouble sleeping. The effects of long-term use of melatonin and how it interacts with other medicines or supplements are unknown. Some reports have indicated that melatonin may interact with blood-thinning medicines and with medications for seizures or diabetes. People taking these medicines should speak with their doctors before taking melatonin. Since melatonin may have an effect on hormone levels, women who are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breast-feeding should not use this supplement. The National Institute on Aging has also warned that melatonin may constrict blood vessels, which could be dangerous for people with high blood pressure or heart disease. Some practitioners believe that children and people under the age of 40 should not take melatonin because their bodies make enough of the hormone naturally. Some also caution people with severe mental illness and those taking steroid medications against using melatonin. Because it has antioxidant properties, concerns have been raised that melatonin might interfere with radiation therapy or chemotherapy, possibly making these treatments less effective. While this concern is based largely on theories of how cancer treatments work, it is supported by some recent studies. For this reason, people being treated for cancer should speak with their doctors before taking this supplement. Some experts also suggest that people with immune system disorders (such as severe allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, or cancers such as lymphoma) should not take melatonin because it may further stimulate the immune system and worsen these conditions. Again, this is based on a theory and not scientific evidence, but people with immune system problems should speak with their doctors before taking this supplement. Relying on this type of treatment alone, and avoiding or delaying conventional medical care for cancer, may have serious health consequences.

Trouble is, chronic exposure to light at night leads to a host of health problems. To understand why chronic exposure to light at night is so bad, we need to consider human evolution. Prior to the end of the stone age, humans were exposed to two different kinds of natural light responsible for regulating circadian rhythmicity. During the day we had the sun, while at night we had the moon and the stars, and perhaps the light from campfires. The binary day/night pattern was unrelenting, and our biological programming followed suit. Today, we have artificial lighting at night (LAN), and it's a different case altogether. Indoor lighting is considerably less powerful than sunlight, but many orders of magnitude greater than star and moonlight. Check out this chart to see what I mean: Advertisement Keep in mind that this is a logarithmic scale, so the difference between sunlight and moonlight is considerable — a difference that influences a series of critical biochemical cascades tied to light periodicity, including the production of cortisol and melatonin levels. Light is a Drug Melatonin suppression is key to understanding much of why LAN is so crappy for us. This workhorse biochemical is produced by the brain's pineal gland at night — when it's dark — to regulate our sleep-wake cycle. It lowers blood pressure, glucose levels, and body temperature — key physiological responses responsible for restful sleep. As neurologist George Brainard puts it, \\"Light works as if it's a drug, except it's not a drug at all.\\" Sponsored The part of your brain that controls your biological clock is the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), a group of cells in the hypothalamus. These cells respond to light and dark signals. The optic nerves in our eyes senses light and transmits a signal to the SCN telling the brain that it's time to wake up. It also kickstarts other processes, like raising body temperature and producing hormones like cortisol. Our cortisol levels are relatively low at night, allowing us to sleep, and higher during the day, allowing for the stabilization of energy levels and the modulation of immune function. But LAN unnaturally elevates cortisol levels at night, which disrupts sleep and introduces a host of problems relating to body-fat levels, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. It also contributes to sleep debt and a disruption the neuroregulation of appetite. But if our rooms are dark at night, there's no optic signal to the SCN, so our bodies pump out the much needed melatonin. Moreover, our melatonin levels are regulated according to the amount of exposure we had to light during the previous day. Related: The science behind power naps and insomnia. The Light Before You Sleep Indeed, studies have shown that exposure to room light before bedtime shortens melatonin duration by about 90 minutes compared to dim light exposure. In addition, exposure to room light during usual hours of sleep suppresses melatonin levels by more than 50%. That's significant. So, even before you hit the hay, the light in your bedroom is causing you problems. With the introduction of tablets, smartphones, and energy-efficient light bulbs, it's an issue that's only getting worse. And just to add insult to injury, many modern devices emit blue light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) — light that's especially good at suppressing melatonin. This is because melanopsin — a photopigment found in specialized cells of the retina involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms — is most sensitive to blue light. Recently, scientists warned college students about the impact of light from computer monitors on melatonin levels. They found that computer light at night — particularly blue light that was scanned by wearing different wavelength-blocking glasses — reduces college students' melatonin levels. A related study found that backlit tablet displays suppress melatonin, disrupting sleep. But the researchers write: \\"[It] is important to acknowledge that usage of self-luminous electronic devices before sleep may disrupt sleep even if melatonin is not suppressed. Clearly, the tasks themselves may be alerting or stressful stimuli that can lead to sleep disruption.\\" Which is a very good point. The Cancer Link Regrettably, all this hormone and biochemical disruption is creating downstream effects — cancer being one of them. Scientists aren't entirely sure why, but studies consistently show a correlation. For example, a 10-year study found that a sample group of over 1,670 women exposed to higher intensity light in their sleeping environment had 22% higher odds of developing breast cancer than those who slept in total darkness. The researchers blamed it on hormone disruption caused by melatonin suppression. In another study, researchers implanted nude rats with breast cancer xenografts and then gave them perfusions of blood from different women. Rats receiving blood from women who were exposed to dim light at night had their tumor growth reduced — but those with blood from women who were exposed to bright light at night weren't granted this beneficial effect. Troublingly, this has grim implications for workers who do shift work. Case-controlled studies have shown that nurses who work rotating shifts at midnight are more at risk for breast cancer compared to nurses with permanent day work. Low Light, Blue Light, Depression and Immune Response Disturbingly, the light at night doesn't even have to be bright to cause problems. Chronic exposure to dim light at night leads to depression-like symptom in hamsters, such as exhibiting less interest in drinking the sugar water that they normally love. But by returning them to a normal, non-lit day/night schedule, the researchers were able to reverse the depression. Scientists suspect that this dim-light depression may be the result of a protein called tumor necrosis factor. Chronic dim light at night also detrimentally affects the immune system. You might want to think about this next time you leave even the dimmest lights on in your bedroom — including your clock radio and the light that bleeds in from street lights. Another study, also on rodents, showed that blue light at night in particular is especially powerful at inducing depression-like symptoms. LAN can also impair mood and learning, again likely on account of melanopsin-expressing neurons. Premature Aging and Heart Problems Melatonin also has antioxidant properties, which plays an important role in anti-aging. Researchers have been able to treat artificially aged mice with melatonin, thus reducing oxidative stress. These mice models are helping scientists understand the fundamental mechanism behind aging because they're the same markers found in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Other studies show a link between melatonin suppression and cardiovascular disease. Weight Gain Light at night also contributes to weight gain by shifting the time of our food intake. Mice, when exposed to LAN, gained more weight — despite exercising and eating as much as their darkness-exposed brethren. Scientists have also correlated low levels of melatonin to diabetes, though it's not clear what role, if any, LAN plays in this matter. Pitch Black All this research points to one basic fact: We need to keep our bedrooms as dark as possible and avoid blue light before sleep. To that end, you should turn off all your light-emitting gadgets and close the blinds. And if possible, refrain from reading your tablet computer or smartphone in the hours preceding sleep. I know, easier said than done. Additional reporting by Joseph Bennington-Castro. Images: Africa Studio/Shutterstock, MNStudio/Shutterstock. Follow me on Twitter: @dvorsky ||||| Tamoxifen is an estrogen-blocking medication typically used to treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. But new research conducted in rats suggests exposure to dim light at night - as little as that coming in a window from a street light - suppresses melatonin production, making tumors resistant to the drug. Researchers found that exposure to dim light at night results in breast cancer tumors becoming resistant to tamoxifen. Researchers found that exposure to dim light at night results intumors becoming resistant to tamoxifen. The study, led by Prof. Steven M. Hill of Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA, is published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. \\"Our levels of melatonin are not determined by sleep, as many people think,\\" explains Prof. Hill. \\"It is actually the darkness that is important. During the night, if you sleep in a brightly lit room, your melatonin levels may be inhibited; however, if you are in the dark but cannot sleep, your melatonin levels will rise normally.\\" He and his team note that disruption of circadian rhythms by night shift work or disturbed sleep could result in an increased risk of breast cancer and other diseases. For patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, Prof. Hill adds that tamoxifen resistance \\"is a growing problem.\\" \\"Our data, although they were generated in rats, have potential implications for the large number of patients with breast cancer who are being treated with tamoxifen, because they suggest that nighttime exposure to light, even dim light, could cause their tumors to become resistant to the drug by suppressing melatonin production,\\" he says. Nighttime melatonin supplement resulted in regressed tumors To conduct their study, the researchers observed rats with human breast tumors that were living in either normal light and dark conditions - which involved 12 hours of light and 12 hours of complete darkness - or alternative conditions - 12 hours of normal light and 12 hours of dim light. Fast facts about tamoxifen's uses To treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body To treat early breast cancer in women who have already been treated with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy To reduce risk of developing a more serious type of breast cancer in women who have had ductal carcinoma in situ To reduce risk of breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease. The rats who were living under normal conditions had blood melatonin levels that rose during the dark period and fell again during the light period. However, the rats living in the alternative conditions had melatonin levels that remained low during the light/dark cycle. Compared with the rats living in normal conditions, the rats living in the dim night light conditions had tumor growth that was 2.6-fold times faster. Additionally, the team found that the rats living in the dim night light had tumors that were completely resistant to tamoxifen, while the rats living in normal conditions had tumors that significantly regressed. However, the team also found that when given a nighttime melatonin supplement, the tumors of the rats living in dim night light conditions likewise regressed. \\"These data suggest that, in the not-too-distant future, it may be possible to combine melatonin and tamoxifen,\\" says Prof. Hill. \\"However, before this is done we would need to identify the optimal times of day to give the two because if the timing between the two is off, the advantage of giving them in combination may be lost.\\" He also notes that their study does not reveal how much light exposure is needed to decrease nighttime melatonin production, resulting in tamoxifen resistance in humans, \\"but we think that it could be as little as the amount of light that comes in the bedroom window from a street light.\\" Though melatonin supplements can be purchased over the counter, Prof. Hill cautions that their research is not yet at the point where he and his team can recommend that breast cancer patients on tamoxifen take melatonin: \\"Melatonin is produced by our bodies at a very specific time of day, exclusively during darkness at night, and taking melatonin supplements at the wrong time of day would potentially disrupt the circadian system, particularly the natural melatonin cycle, which may, in itself, paradoxically impair breast cancer responsiveness to tamoxifen.\\" The team is now conducting further studies to investigate how much light exposure suppresses nighttime melatonin production in humans to the point where it would make tumors tamoxifen-resistant. Medical News Today recently reported on a study that suggested the gel form of tamoxifen is just as effective as the oral form, with fewer side effects. |||||Summary:","completion":"A study warns that even low levels of light in bedrooms may stop breast cancer drugs from working.

VALENCIA, Spain -- Defending America's Cup champions Alinghi of Switzerland have revealed they are to start building a multihull yacht for their duel against American challengers Oracle. Alinghi have promised a \\"big beast of a boat\\" when they take on American challengers Oracle. Alinghi's design team coordinator Grant Simmer said: \\"We are looking at building a big beast of a boat and the loads are off the scale compared to most of the boats we've been involved with.\\" \\"Obviously from a naval architecture point of view this is an extremely fast and exciting boat,\\" he told a news conference in the Spanish port of Valencia which hosted the last America's Cup in July 2007. Earlier this month, San Francisco-based Oracle, backed by Silicon Valley maverick Larry Ellison, announced that construction of a multihull yacht for its America's Cup challenge was \\"well underway\\" on the US Pacific coast. While Alinghi, which is backed by biotech tycoon Ernesto Bertarelli, has not yet started to build its boat, the Swiss team have been training on both catamarans and trimarans in Europe. The two sides will be facing off in a duel, or Deed of Gift Match, for the 33rd America's Cup because they failed to reach an agreement on the rules for a traditional regatta involving several teams. The New York Supreme Court, the trustee of the Deed of Gift, the 1887 document which details the complex rules of the America's Cup, is expected to rule shortly on the next date for yachting's showpiece event. Alinghi prefer May 2009 while Oracle want October 2008. The Swiss team argues it cannot build a competitive multihull yacht by October in order to adequately defend their crown for what would be their third straight title. \\"Today we have a way forward,\\" said Alinghi team skipper Brad Butterworth. \\"Ernesto has committed to building this multi-hull and as long as we can get the pending issues resolved by the New York courts, including a race date in 2009, we'll be sailing in a huge multi-hull against Oracle,\\" he added. Butterworth said Alinghi had retained most of the sailors that it had during the last America's Cup \\"with a slight downsize\\" and had recruited people with experience in a multi-hull challenge. Alinghi retained the America's Cup by beating Team New Zealand in a hugely successful event in Valencia in July 2007. The 33rd America's Cup had originally been scheduled to be held in Valencia in July 2009 as a traditional regatta involving several teams. But organisers indefinately postponed the event in November because of the legal wrangling betwen Oracle and Alinghi over the rules of the event. E-mail to a friend.

Her anxiety or nervousness could have resulted in unproductive time usage. 4. Underestimating the task: Bailey might have initially underestimated the time and effort required to prepare her speech, causing her to use up more time than planned. 5. Miscommunication or misunderstanding: It is also possible that there was a miscommunication or misunderstanding regarding the time allotted for each person to work on their speeches. Bailey might have unknowingly used up Addison's time due to misconceptions about the schedule. In conclusion, Bailey's overextension of her time on the speech, causing her to use up Addison's time as well, could be due to several reasons such as time management issues, over-preparation, nervousness, underestimation, or miscommunication. The specific reason would depend on further context and the circumstances surrounding Bailey's speech preparation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Having visited nearly half a dozen times over the years, and somehow not managing to share it on my blog over the years, I would say that although you could visit from London for the day, I wouldn’t. Go for a minimum of an overnight stay, or a few days if you can. Witness a misty morning, and a candy coloured sunset, wander out into the Dales or slip in a seaside visit somewhere like Scarborough, and really get to know the ancient city. Alas, I haven’t really learned how to take my own advice, but hot on the end of a family visit in Lincolnshire we were lucky enough to spend sometime with one of my favourite expats on Yorkshire (ok, ok, I only know two, but they are definitely in the top two of that limited ranking system). It was of course Amanda, her fabulous husband Sam and we got to meet their gorgeous new addition to the family, a mischevious Dachshund pup who goes by the name of Harold.

Lewis Robert \\"Hack\\" Wilson (April 26, 1900 - November 23, 1948) was an American Major League Baseball player who played 12 seasons for the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark yet to be surpassed. \\" Lewis Robert Wilson was born April 26, 1900, in the Pennsylvania steel mill town of Ellwood City, north of Pittsburgh. His mother, Jennie Kaughn, 16, was an unemployed drifter from Philadelphia; his father, Robert Wilson, 24, was a steel worker. His parents never married; both were heavy drinkers, and in 1907 his mother died of appendicitis at the age of 24. In 1916 Lewis left school to take a job at a locomotive factory, swinging a sledge hammer for four dollars a week. Although only five feet six inches tall, he weighed 195 pounds with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size-five-and-one-half shoes. Sportswriter Shirley Povich later observed that he was \\"built along the lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents.\\" While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time, his large head, tiny feet, short legs and broad, flat face are now recognized as hallmarks of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. In 1921 Wilson moved to Martinsburg, West Virginia, to join the Martinsburg Mountaineers of the Class \\"D\\" Blue Ridge League. After breaking his leg while sliding into home plate during his first professional game, he was moved from the catcher's position to the outfield. In 1922 he met Virginia Riddleburger, a 34-year-old office clerk; they married the following year. In 1923, playing for the \\"B\\" division Portsmouth Truckers, he led the Virginia League in hitting with a .388 batting average.

With no official figures available, it is estimated that 600,000-900,000 persons fled the country during the Lebanese Civil War . Although some have since returned, this permanently disturbed Lebanese population growth and greatly complicated demographic statistics. Another result of the war was a large number of internally displaced persons. This especially affected the southern Shia community, as Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1978, 1982 and 1996 prompted waves of mass emigration, in addition to the continual strain of occupation and fighting between Israel and Hezbollah . Many Shias from Southern Lebanon resettled in the suburbs south of Beirut. After the war, the pace of Christian emigration accelerated, as many Christians felt discriminated against in a Lebanon under increasingly oppressive Syrian occupation.

Article: My son Jack, a fourth grader, was having a hard time in getting interested in story books recently, so I offered to read the first few chapters to him. In the early pages of 'Incident at Halk Hill', a quiet little boy has a special meeting with a female badger .Soon after, another badger is caught in a steel leg trap , and the author describes in detail the pain and scare of an animal struggling to its death. We meet the cruel hunter and his ill treatment of a dog; we see the badger being skinned by the boy's father;and we experience the child's confusion when beaten by his father in anger. _ , I thought. Last night , I returned from a weekend away to find that Jack had finished the whole book on his own. \\"It was really, really good and sad, and violent,\\" he reported. \\"There was a lot of killing.\\" \\"Were there any happy parts?\\" I asked, \\"The boy's life was saved by the badger, and that was good. But then that badger got caught in a trap again and at the end it's dying, too. \\" Jack said, \\"It was so sad that I almost cried. \\" I told him that many books have made me cry, beginning with Heidi, when I was just his age, right on up to the novel I finished last week. \\"Well,\\" he admitted then, \\"I actually did cry. Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own.

When Toby follows Les home and asks for a warm place to sleep for the night Les agrees partly because Toby proves himself to be an honest type and also because the homeless man suggests he can function as a lackey for the photographer. Toby has a seeming value as he repairs things within his grasp like the stationary bike in Les's apartment as well as the radiator. When Les takes Toby to a club to get pictures of K'Harma, Toby is smitten with the young female singer. Les learns that hot shot actor Chuck Sirloin (Jack Gwaltney) is getting surgery on his penis and manages to scoop the photos for a local tabloid magazine. When Les takes Toby to an STD Daytime Drama Benefit, influential casting director Dana (Gina Gershon) is immediately attracted to the purity of the young man and determines to boost his career for his attention. Because of his ability to get the shots of Chuck Sirloin Les is invited to the next K'Harma concert and by chance Toby gets pulled into K'Harma's party and ends up spending the night talking with her as she bonds with his sense of stability as compared to her own sense of homelessness. K'Harma invites Toby to a party with Elvis Costello and Toby brings Les along but when Les takes photos at the party K'Harma is upset and security ejects the two men.

How a small yet mighty bit of paper can still get you a job This simple transaction still has the potential to be painfully embarrassing if you get it wrong. But Walter Faulstroh, co-founder of HUM Nutrition, says he has finally managed to fine-tune the art of the business card exchange after many years living in Paris, London and now Los Angeles. This has meant tailoring his approach carefully to where he is and who he’s meeting. If you pull out a business card, they look at you like you’re from a different [era] In Europe, he says, the card is often still formally presented — as it always has been — upon introduction, then carefully tucked away. But on the US West Coast, things are different. As part of the startup crowd, Faulstroh typically waits for his counterpart to do a formal introduction, but if there isn’t one he skips handing over his card. “It’s become quite complex,” he says. It’s so extreme that at some tech conferences, “if you pull out a business card, they look at you like you’re from a different [era].” Instead, he quickly follows up with new contacts via LinkedIn or another social media platform to cement the connection. The business card exchange itself is a ritual So if we’ve all become such ‘digital natives’, why is it still relevant to hand over a piece of card? More than just an exchange of details, business cards help with that crucial positive first impression, act as an ice breaker, grab someone’s attention and even boost your credibility, say experts. Doing business in parts of Asia, Latin America and even Southern Europe often still means adopting a traditional approach. “The business card exchange itself is a ritual,” even if can seem redundant in the age of social media, says Sebastian Reiche, an assistant professor at IESE Business School in Barcelona. “We are still printing business cards, but you really don’t need them.” In mainland China, American Michael Michelini, a Shenzhen-based marketer, learned to hand over his card with both hands with the words facing towards the other person. He also makes sure to glance at any cards he receives and to put them anywhere but his back pocket, which is a big no-no. He’s now careful to glance at the details (it signifies respect) after a business card is handed to him. Even after 10 years in China, “I’m still not as good at paying attention,” he says. “It distracts me usually.” The entire ritual is meant to honour the person giving the card and is practiced in some form or another throughout most of Asia. In countries where traditional hierarchical rules apply, the card serves as a reminder of status In countries where traditional business rules apply, the card still serves as a reminder of status, says IESE’s Reiche. “In a culture where hierarchy is important, the person wants to [see the card] to prepare how to interact with you and how to address you,” he says. Nicole Dyer Griffith, an international protocol consultant, in Trinidad, advises clients overseas to follow the lead of the most senior person in the group. For example, some cultures may save the business card exchange until the end of the meeting, elsewhere introductions are made with a business card in hand. Amazing as it may sound to people doing business in the US or UK, disregarding this practice can potentially sour an entire business exchange, she adds. “It’s important to try to [follow etiquette] as best as possible.” Even taste in design varies significantly worldwide, according to Chad Jennings, chief product officer at Moo, a UK-based printer and designer of business cards. Unlike in the UK and across Europe, thinner — not thicker — paper stock is a mark of luxury in Japan and China, he says. In China, cards tend to be filled with text, while Swiss and German cards are more sparse, pointing out only the most essential details without bragging about career achievements. In the UK, gold foil text is the most popular because it provides a more luxurious look, he adds. So the business card’s not dead yet. In fact it’s getting a makeover. Last year, Moo launched its NFC-enabled business cards, which stands for near-field communication. These cards use so-called smart paper to store data to be scanned by a smartphone or another electronic device. While it’s still just a tiny fraction of Moo’s sales, Jennings says the idea is slowly starting to take hold. “People are using it in really unique ways,” he says. “Some associate [the business card] with a Spotify playlist.” People are using it in really unique ways In March, the company also launched Monogram by Moo, an app that serves as a digital business card of sorts that allows users to share their portfolio on their smartphone or send it along electronically, which can be shown “to tell their story” in addition to a traditional card. “You can pull it up and hand it over to the person,” he says. Michelini says that his business cards now include a WeChat QR code on the back to allow for another user of the China-based social media platform to scan it straight away and connect online. Often, in lieu of business cards, he simply generates a QR code via smartphone, which is then scanned by a business associate, he adds. The practice — popular with his Chinese associates — is preferable to a more traditional card, because it automatically ensures an online connection, he adds. But “not everyone is on the same level technologically,” says Dyer Griffith. For most industries, the business card exchange can feel as necessary as a handshake. “It still adds that personal touch,” she says.

Although many professionals now prefer to connect via platforms like LinkedIn, business cards remain an important part of business culture in certain countries, particularly those in Asia, Latin America, and Southern Europe. Business card exchanges are often considered a ritual and are used to establish status within hierarchies. The design of business cards can also vary significantly around the world.

Movie plot title: Contraband Movie plot: Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) is a smuggler, one member of an organized team trafficking cigarettes and booze up and down the coast off Naples, Italy. After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency allowing the smugglers to get away, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assasins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (think Sonny Corlone's death scene in 'The Godfather'), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car.Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses. After his brother's funeral, conducted on the gang's speedboats in the Bay of Naples, with the police surveying them, Luca vows revenge. Despite his wife Adele's (Ivana Monti) pleas, Luca goes after the prime suspect: Scherino. That night, Luca breaks into Scherino's house, but gets spotted and severely beaten up by Scherino's henchmen. However, Scherino spares Luca's life and instead has him thrown out of the house. He tells Luca that he's got it all wrong: he had no part in Mickey's killing.After Luca recovers from his injuries thanks to a local doctor named Charlie (Giordano Falzoni) who treats injuries for large bribes of cash, Luca meets with an informant who gives him a tip to who ordered the hit on Mickey.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if forest rangers are more diligent at watching for fires, they would likely be able to prevent or quickly control wildfires. This would affect the greenhouse effect in an indirect way. When wildfires occur, they release large quantities of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere, which contributes to the greenhouse effect. In addition, burning forests also reduce the number of trees available to absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. Thus, by preventing or controlling wildfires more effectively, forest rangers would help to limit the release of carbon dioxide from wildfires and maintain the number of trees that can store carbon dioxide, ultimately reducing the greenhouse effect to a certain extent. However, it is important to note that this perturbation would have a relatively small impact on the overall greenhouse effect, as human activities like burning fossil fuels contribute significantly more to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The list contains both alphabetical and numerical elements. Your goal is to rearrange the list so that all the alphabetical elements come first, and all the numerical elements come after. Here are the steps to follow: 1. Understand the input list: The input is a list containing several items. In the given example, the list is: ['3331', 'F', 'q', '6135', '9143', '7897', 'c', '8947', '5899', 'J', 'E', '6137', 'S', '9207', 'R', '2255', '5633', '575', '817', '8747', '2825', '2071', 'e', '5491', 'S', 'N', '9265'] 2. Separate the alphabetical and numerical elements: Go through the list and separate the elements into two new lists - one for the alphabetical elements and another for the numerical elements. Alphabetical list: ['F', 'q', 'c', 'J', 'E', 'S', 'R', 'e', 'S', 'N'] Numerical list: ['3331', '6135', '9143', '7897', '8947', '5899', '6137', '9207', '2255', '5633', '575', '817', '8747', '2825', '2071', '5491', '9265'] 3. Maintain the order: Make sure the order of the elements in each individual list (alphabetical and numerical) remains the same as in the original input list. 4. Reorganize the list: Once you have the two separate lists, combine them into a new list by placing the alphabetical elements first, followed by the numerical elements. The rearranged list will be: ['F', 'q', 'c', 'J', 'E', 'S', 'R', 'e', 'S', 'N', '3331', '6135', '9143', '7897', '8947', '5899', '6137', '9207', '2255', '5633', '575', '817', '8747', '2825', '2071', '5491', '9265'] 5.

Joel chased Kenneth around the room while holding a spider and laughing because Available options: * Joel is a jerk.; * Kenneth is a jerk.;","completion":"Joel chased Kenneth around the room while holding a spider and laughing because he seemed to enjoy Kenneth's fear of spiders. Joel found amusement in Kenneth's panic as he darted around, trying to avoid the eight-legged creature. For years, Joel always tried to find creative ways to get under Kenneth's skin, and this time, the tiny spider was his winning instrument. Joel is a jerk. Although Joel might consider his actions to be playful or funny, it's clear that, in this situation, Joel is a jerk. It's worth noting that everyone has different thresholds for what they consider to be amusing or offensive, but there's one matter that almost everybody agrees on: it's mean-spirited to exploit someone's fear for amusement. Joel's behavior demonstrates a lack of empathy toward Kenneth's phobia and highlights his inclination to derive pleasure from someone else's distress. Furthermore, he disregards Kenneth's feelings in favor of his enjoyment, which underscores his selfish nature. Now, let's consider the following alternative scenario: Kenneth is a jerk. Suppose Kenneth has a history of being inconsiderate and rude towards Joel. Perhaps he frequently mocked Joel for his interests or constantly belittled his accomplishments. In this case, one could argue that Joel's actions were merely a form of payback for the mistreatment he had endured at the hands of Kenneth. Despite Kenneth's behavior, using a genuine phobia to take revenge still classifies Joel as a jerk. Two wrongs don't make a right, and resorting to similar behavior to retaliate is immature and unproductive. An effective resolution would require direct confrontation to discuss their differences and find common ground. It's crucial to reflect on how one's actions impact others, even if taken in jest. In both scenarios mentioned above, Joel's actions would be perceived as cruel, regardless of Kenneth's demeanor. Respect, empathy, and open communication should be the foundation of any relationship, either friendly or otherwise. In conclusion, the situation shows that Joel is a jerk for using Kenneth's fear of spiders as a tool to provoke him. Such behavior only serves to intensify any existing animosity between them. Ultimately, it's important to treat others with kindness and respect and strive for open communication to ensure a healthy, positive relationship with those around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? a smart movie","completion":"Determining the sentiment of a sentence containing the phrase \\"a smart movie\\" requires context and a deeper understanding of the words used as well as the intent behind them. However, with the available information, we can infer the sentiment through the analysis of the words and their general connotations. Based on the terms used, the sentiment in the sentence can be interpreted as positive. Here is a breakdown of the words and their general connotations: 1. \\"Smart\\" generally refers to something that showcases intelligence, cleverness, or astuteness. In this case, it's being used to describe a movie, which implies the movie presents unique ideas or thought-provoking content. This can lead to positive emotions like admiration, appreciation, or enjoyment. 2. \\"Movie\\" is a neutral term that simply designates the medium, in this case, a film. The overall sentiment is determined by the accompanying adjective or describing word, which, in this sentence, is \\"smart.\\" It is important to acknowledge that context is crucial in gauging the true sentiment behind this statement. The surrounding words and the intent of the speaker can alter the connotation. For example, if the sentence were part of a more extensive statement like, \\"I expected a smart movie, but it was a waste of time,\\" the sentiment would shift negatively.

This conclusion can be arrived at through several pieces of evidence provided in the text. Firstly, Jan went to the bookstore with a specific purpose in mind: she was looking for a cookbook. This indicates that she has an interest in cooking and is potentially open to trying new recipes. By seeking out a cookbook, Jan demonstrates that she is proactive and inclined to expand her knowledge of different dishes to prepare at home. Secondly, when Jan was at the bookstore, she sought assistance from a clerk to help her find a good cookbook. This implies that she values the opinions of experts within the cooking and culinary field and wants to make informed decisions when selecting a cookbook. By relying on the guidance of the store clerk, Jan exhibits a measure of trust in their expertise and expects to find the best cookbook suited to her needs. Thirdly, Jan chose to buy an Asian cuisine cookbook. This could illustrate her preference or curiosity regarding Asian food and her willingness to experiment with different flavors and ingredients from that region. By opting specifically for an Asian cuisine cookbook, Jan shows an openness to trying a more diverse range of dishes rather than sticking to recipes she may already be familiar with. Finally, after purchasing the cookbook, Jan made sweet and sour chicken for dinner. This action directly confirms her willingness to make chicken for dinner. The text informs us that Jan prepared a chicken dish from her newly acquired cookbook, signifying her intention to make use of the book in learning and preparing different types of meals. Based on the information provided and the logical sequence of events, it is evident that Jan has an interest in cooking, trusts the recommendation of experts, and is receptive to trying diverse recipes.

A flood occurs when a river overflows its banks. This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge.

Article: Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not? Because the worrying thing is we can't live without our phones. We've become communication addicts, unable to spend even a few minutes out of contact, in case we miss something 'important'.

The answer is:","completion":"People made fewer phone calls. The writer's point about using telephones before the invention of mobile phones is that people made fewer phone calls due to the limitations and inconveniences of landlines and public phones. The article states that, back then, one had to stay at home or at their desks to make or receive a call, or use public phones on the streets, which required carrying a lot of coins to pay for the calls. As a result, people didn't phone their friends as often as they do now with mobile phones.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. How old was Billie Jo when the dog ate her homework - at least 14 - not enough information - around ten years old - at least 11 The answer to this question is:","completion":"Billie Jo was around ten years old when the incident of her dog eating her homework occurred. This event led to a significant amount of distress for the young girl, as she was worried about being ridiculed by her classmates and potentially disappointing her teachers. However, the situation was salvaged by her mother's intervention, who took it upon herself to visit the classroom and present the half-eaten paper as evidence in support of Billie Jo's claim. This unexpected incident highlights the importance of being prepared for unforeseen situations and demonstrates how supportive family members can help resolve potentially embarrassing predicaments. In this particular case, Billie Jo's mother's actions not only saved her from potential embarrassment but also reinforced the trust between the child and her teachers, who had always held her in high regard. The story of Billie Jo's dog eating her homework serves as a reminder that even the most diligent and responsible students can face unforeseeable challenges. It is essential for teachers and parents to recognize and understand that students may experience setbacks and need support and understanding in these situations. In conclusion, Billie Jo was around ten years old when her dog ate her homework, causing worry and concern about her academic standing and her reputation among her peers. Fortunately, her mother's swift intervention and presentation of evidence to the teacher averted any adverse consequences for Billie Jo, allowing her to continue thriving academically and maintaining her standing as a well-regarded, diligent, and responsible student."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However, she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time, though this time he is carrying a full-length, life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square, as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro, he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square, then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next, Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying.

A passer-by spotted the body of Mrs Solik in a river on Friday 17 February, and a search and dive unit discovered Mr Solik's body last Monday. Police said Mrs Solik had suffered a head injury, and both of the couple's hands had been bound. Several teams of officers, including a canine unit, are investigating the murders. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Maj Gen Bheki Langa said officers would \\"not rest until the killers are brought to book\\". The Times' Africa correspondent Aislinn Laing said people in South Africa were \\"horrified\\" by the deaths despite the country's high crime rate. \\"In a small community like this it has caused a huge amount of alarm,\\" she told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. The couple lived on a farm estate in the town of Nottingham Road, about 100 miles (160km) in land from Durban. Mrs Savage said the couple had returned home to Mountain Ash in January in order for Mrs Solik to see her father, Glyn Savage, before he passed away. Members of both families plan to travel from the UK to South Africa on Saturday as the couple's funeral is due to be held in Cape Town on Tuesday. \\"They were wonderful parents, had four lovely children, who are obviously suffering now,\\" said Mrs Savage. \\"I remember we always had wonderful holidays out there - all of the family - we'd make a special effort.\\" In a joint statement issued on Tuesday, the couple's four children, Alexander and Gregory, 32, Jessica, 30, and Brendon, 29, said it was \\"hard to understand that... something so violent could happen\\".

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can cause golf clubs to repel each other?\\" is \\"friction\\", given that magnetism can cause golf clubs to repel each other? Pick from: A. Yes. B. No. Answer:","completion":"B. No. Friction cannot be considered the right answer to the question \\"what can cause golf clubs to repel each other?\\" given that magnetism can cause golf clubs to repel each other. Friction is the force that opposes the movement of one surface across another, whereas magnetism is the force that establishes an interaction between objects that possess a magnetic charge. Magnetism can indeed cause golf clubs to repel each other in certain instances. Golf clubs themselves are typically not magnetic, but they can become magnetized if they come into contact with powerful magnets or undergo a strong magnetic field exposure. Additionally, if a golf club has any ferromagnetic materials such as iron or steel, it can potentially become magnetized. Once magnetized, the clubs can experience a repelling force if the poles (north and south) of their magnetic fields are aligned in opposing directions. This repelling force is due to magnetic repulsion, which dictates that like poles repel each other. Although friction is an essential factor in golf, impacting how the club moves and interacts with the ball and turf, it does not play a role in causing golf clubs to repel each other. As such, the correct response to the question is option B. No."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Possible A: suface of moon, building, bridge, ground, bright light Why is \\"ground\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Ground\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because shadows typically form on solid surfaces where light is obstructed by an object. In everyday human experiences, the most common surface where shadows appear is the ground. This is due to the light sources we encounter daily, such as sunlight or artificial light from lamps or streetlights, which generally come from above. In these situations, when light shines on an object such as a person, tree, or vehicle, the side of the object that is not facing the light source remains in darkness, creating a shadow on the surface behind the object. Since the ground is underneath most objects, it is the usual surface that receives these shadows. While it's true that shadows can form on other surfaces like the moon's surface, buildings, and bridges, the ground is the most frequently encountered surface for shadows in our daily lives. This makes it the answer that best aligns with human common sense."},{"prompt":"Information: - Doris May Lessing CH (née Tayler; 22 October 1919 17 November 2013) was a British novelist, poet, playwright, librettist, biographer and short story writer.

Solve -v - 7*v + 56 = 0 for v.","completion":"To solve the equation -v - 7*v + 56 = 0 for the variable v, we first need to simplify and rewrite the equation. The given equation can be simplified as follows: Step 1: Combine the like terms The like terms here are -v and -7*v. -v - 7*v = -1*v - 7*v = (-1 - 7)*v = -8*v Now, our simplified equation becomes: -8*v + 56 = 0 Step 2: Solve for v We want to get v by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we will first move the constant term, which is 56, to the other side of the equation. -8*v + 56 = 0 -8*v = -56 (Subtract 56 from both sides) Now, we need to get v by itself. Since v is being multiplied by -8, we will divide both sides of the equation by -8 to isolate v: -8*v / -8 = -56 / -8 v = 7 So the solution to the given equation -v - 7*v + 56 = 0 is v = 7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where might he live? Here are possible answers to this question: - house - apartment - village - beach condo - hotel I believe the correct choice is \\"apartment\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"James likely lives in an apartment, and there are several reasons for this choice. First, let's consider the nature of the hide bed sofa itself. A hide bed sofa, also known as a sofa bed or a sleeper sofa, is a piece of furniture that is designed to serve a dual purpose. It can be used either as a sofa for sitting, or it can be easily transformed into a bed for sleeping by pulling out the hidden mattress underneath. The primary advantage of a hide bed sofa is the efficient use of space that it provides. Now, let's analyze the living situations for each of the given options: 1. House: Typically, a house has more space than an apartment, which means that residents living in a house generally have more rooms and can therefore allot separate spaces for sitting and sleeping. In this situation, there would be less need for a piece of furniture like a hide bed sofa that combines the two functions. 2. Village: Living in a village does not provide any specific information about the kind of dwelling James is living in. He could be living in a house or an apartment within the village. Thus, we cannot make a clear decision based on this option. 3. Beach Condo: A beach condo is similar to an apartment in terms of space limitations. However, a beach condo is generally a vacation property and not a primary residence. While it's possible that James might have chosen a hide bed sofa for his beach condo, the scenario seems less likely in comparison to him having a hide bed sofa in his primary residence, where regular space efficiency is a concern. 4. Hotel: In most cases, people do not buy furniture for a hotel room, as it is a temporary place to stay, and the hotel already provides the necessary furniture. It would be rare for someone to purchase a hide bed sofa for a hotel room. Taking all these factors into account, the most likely reason James bought a hide bed sofa is because he lives in an apartment. Living in an apartment often means having limited space, which leads individuals to seek out furniture items that can serve multiple purposes and conserve space. A hide bed sofa is an excellent choice for this objective, as it allows James to have both a sitting area and a sleeping area in the same space, without the need for separate furniture items. This space-saving solution is a clear indication that James most likely resides in an apartment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How is rain measured? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions \\"How do you measure rain?\\" and \\"How is rain measured?\\" are semantically the same. Both are asking about the method or procedure for measuring the amount of rainfall. The only difference is the way they are phrased - the first is direct, as if asking someone specific (in this case, an artificial intelligence), while the second is indirect and impersonal. Now, let's breakdown the steps to answer these questions. \\"Measuring rain\\" implies we are quantifying the amount of rainfall. Here is a step-by-step process to measure the rain: 1. **Rain Gauge Installation and Collection:** The instrument used to measure rain is a rain gauge. It is typically a straight cylindrical container, marked on the side for measurement. The rain gauge should be placed in an open area where no buildings or trees can obstruct the rainfall. It must be stable enough not to be knocked over or affected by wind. The rainwater collected in the gauge directly represents the amount of rainfall. 2. **Measurement:** Following a period of rainfall, the water level in the gauge is checked. Based on the marked increments on the side of the rain gauge, one can measure the height of the water. It's important to level your eyes with the water surface to avoid reading errors due to the angle of view (known as parallax error). 3. **Recording:** The measured rainfall volume is then recorded. It's important to record consistently after each rainfall to create a reliable measurement data set over time. 4. **Data Analysis:** The recorded data provides useful information about seasonal changes, local climate, and patterns in weather behavior. These analyses can be used for various purposes like agricultural planning, flood predictions, and climate studies. 5. **Emptying:** After each measurement, the rain gauge should be emptied to prepare for the next round of rain collection. It's worth noting that while manually operated rain gauges are common, there are also automated types, such as tipping bucket rain gauges and weighing rain gauges, which record rainfall electronically with no intervention required."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Keith has four plants in his backyard, plant A, plant B, plant C, and plant D. Plant A is very large, but plant B is smaller. Plant C and D are the same size. He applied some gibberellins to plant C, but didn't apply anything to plant D. He got curious about why some plants are bigger, while others are not. and a hint : Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. Please answer this question : Which plant would not see increase in growth, plant C or plant D? Answer:","completion":"Plant D would not see an increase in growth as compared to plant C. To understand this in more detail, let's take a closer look at the role of gibberellins in plant growth and how this hormone affects the growth of plants. Gibberellins are a class of plant hormones that play a crucial role in regulating various growth processes. They are responsible for stimulating cell elongation, promoting germination, and overcoming dormancy, among other things. When Keith applied gibberellins to plant C, he essentially boosted the concentration of this hormone in that particular plant, helping to increase its growth rate by stimulating the elongation of its stem and possibly improving other aspects of its development. This means that plant C, post the application of gibberellins, will experience an enhanced rate of growth as compared to its previous state and potentially compared to other plants that did not receive the hormone treatment. On the other hand, plant D did not receive any gibberellins from Keith. This means that plant D would continue to grow at its natural pace, dictated by its genetics and environmental conditions. Since plant D is not experiencing any external hormonal intervention, its growth rate would not see a significant increase as compared to plant C, which has received the gibberellin treatment. So, the answer to the question is that plant D would not see an increase in growth compared to plant C. Understanding the role of plant hormones like gibberellins can help gardeners or horticulture scientists manipulate the growth and development of plants for various purposes, such as increasing yield, improving morphology, or achieving desirable characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a crew member of the salvage ship USS Hoist, where he is assigned to the galley, he is inspired by the bravery of one of the divers, Master Chief Petty Officer Leslie William \\"Billy\\" Sunday (De Niro). He is determined to overcome racism and become the first black American Navy diver, even proclaiming that he will become a master diver. He eventually is selected to attend Diving and Salvage School in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he arrives as a boatswain's mate second class. He finds that Master Chief Sunday is the leading chief petty officer and head instructor, who is under orders from the school's eccentric, bigoted commanding officer to ensure that Brashear fails. Brashear struggles to overcome his educational shortcomings, a result of his leaving school in the 7th grade in order to work on his family's failing farm. He receives educational assistance from his future wife, a medical student who works part-time in the Harlem (New York City) Public Library. Brashear proves himself as a diver by rescuing a fellow student whose dive buddy abandons him during a salvage evaluation. Unfortunately, due to the racism of the commanding officer (Hal Holbrook), the student who fled in the face of danger is awarded a medal for Brashear's heroic actions. Likewise, during an underwater assembling task where each student has to assemble a flange underwater using a bag of tools, Brashear's bag is cut open. Brashear nevertheless finishes the assembly and graduates from diving school, earning the quiet and suppressed admiration of Master Chief Sunday and his fellow divers. Master Chief Sunday is later demoted to senior chief by the commanding officer for standing up for Brashear and allowing him to pass. The paths and careers of Brashear and Sunday sharply diverge.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Sources: Texas Rangers trade Ian Kinsler to Detroit Tigers for Prince Fielder - MLB News Updated Nov 21, 2013 12:45 PM ET The Texas Rangers on Wednesday traded second baseman Ian Kinsler to the Detroit Tigers for first baseman Prince Fielder. The Rangers, who officially announced the transaction Wednesday night, will also receive 30 million cash. Fielder is owed 168 million over the next seven years, Kinsler 62 million over the next four. That brings a net savings of 72 million for the Tigers. Fielder signed a nine-year, 214 million deal with the Tigers in January 2012. Kinsler signed a five-year, 75 million extension with the Rangers in April 2012. The implications for the Tigers are obvious. The savings on Fielder's contract could enable them to keep American League Cy Young winner Max Scherzer, who can become a free agent after the 2014 season, and AL MVP Miguel Cabrera, who can become a free agent after 2015. The blockbuster opens up positions for prospects. Nick Castellanos could play third base for the Tigers, with Cabrera moving to first. Jurickson Profar could play second base for the Rangers. There are free-agent implications, as well. The Rangers are presumably out on Mike Napoli. They had been involved on Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran, as well, among others. ''Obviously, a very exciting trade for us in adding Prince Fielder to the organization,'' Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. ''Also a tough trade to make in that Ian Kinsler's been with the organization since he was drafted in \`03, and we've signed him here a couple of times. Been here, a catalyst for our World Series clubs, and a huge part of this. A winning guy, a heart-and-soul guy, and Detroit got a tremendous player and person.'' Robinson Cano is the biggest star on the market. Who are the best players for sale Fielder, a five-time All-Star, had to consent to the trade before it could be completed because of a limited no-trade provision. ''We're thankful for what he did for us,'' Detroit general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ''It'll be a bat that we miss at times — there's no doubt about it.'' Fielder hit .279 with 25 homers this year. He drove in 106 runs, but it was his lowest home run total over a full season. He did not have a single RBI in the 2013 postseason and hit .182 in the ALCS. Daniels said the trade came together quickly; the first discussions took place Tuesday. The Rangers will welcome the durable Fielder, who has played 162 games in four of the past five seasons. Texas was interested in Fielder when he signed with Detroit as a free agent. ''Our offer was well below what it ended up being, so we weren't that close,'' Daniels said. ''I thought he was a genuine guy that really loved the game, really loved playing the game, loved his boys, his sons.'' Kinsler batted .277 with 13 homers this year. The three-time All-Star was limited to 136 games because of injuries to his ribs and right side. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","completion":"In November 2013, the Texas Rangers traded second baseman Ian Kinsler to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for first baseman Prince Fielder.

Soccer is a very physical game that is often played outdoors. Between the rain and your sweat, your socks may get extremely moist. Many brands have technology to wick away sweat and moisture. Hygiene, odour issues, and performance can all be affected by extreme moisture. Each brand has its own patented technology: Puma technology is referred to as DryCell, CoolPlus Yarn, and CoolCell. Nike technology is referred to as Dri-Fit. Adidas technology is referred to as ClimaCool and ClimaLite. Under Armour technology is referred to as ArmourDry and HeatGear Each player is comfortable with a different sock length. In an official match, you may need to keep your socks at least above your shin guard. In practice you may find that a shorter length allows for more movement. Cold weather may also affect your decision. Here are some helpful descriptions that you may come across: OTC stand for socks that come over the calf. These socks are the longest you can get and usually are worn above your knee. Crew refers to socks that cover slightly above your calf. Low-cut refers to socks that are below your calf and slightly above your ankle. No-show refers to socks that are below your ankle and basically cannot be seen with your shoes on. Invest in higher end technology that creates strategic support, cushioning, and comfort for each foot. These socks will usually have an L or R to indicate which foot to place the sock on to. Choose from a variety of technological specifications including: ribbed ankle support, anti-odor technology, mesh ventilation, achilles cushioning, and arch support. For example, you may need achilles cushioning if you have been injured or find that your shoes irritate that area when you perform certain movements. Team administrators and coaches may have the added responsibility of choosing team colours. They should also consider construction and sweat control as these socks will need to be durable and prevent player issues with hygiene and performance. Think about the ratio of synthetic material against natural material before making your final decision. Synthetic materials provide more stretch and can help to manage sweat and moisture. Synthetic materials include polyester and spandex. Natural materials can provide warmth and increased cushioning. These materials include cotton and hemp. A blend of both synthetic and natural materials tend to work best. Also factor in your team’s budget before making the final purchase. If you don’t wear shin guards while practicing, you have a lot more sock options. Crew socks are very popular for training. No-show and low-cut socks are popular for cardio or gym training. You must choose the right size and correct material to meet your comfort and fit needs. Training can be grueling and the wrong fit can lead to painful blisters. Your skin may also get easily irritated by certain material. If you are on a team, you will need two pairs for both your home and away soccer kits. If you play in tournaments, you will most likely play in several games in one day or over a weekend. Training may require at least five pairs depending on how often you intend to train during the week. High-level players may train every day or even two or three times in a single day. You can get blisters, athlete’s foot, or severe foot damage if you continuously wear your used socks without cleaning them. Keep in mind that you will also need extra socks for cold weather, if you damage a pair, or if a fresh pair helps with your performance. You may also lose a single sock in the laundry or use specific pairs for specific activities. For example, you may use a special pair for shoot outs. Players at every position prefer different socks lengths. If you are a forward and attack aggressively, you may want your socks to be lower or to have added achilles support for your quick movements and ball handling. Goalies may prefer socks that are thicker and longer when playing in colder weather.

Usage: The given word is \\"Australian.\\" In the question, \\"When was the venue established where a rival played who in 2012 finished first in the Australian conference?\\", \\"Australian\\" is an adjective describing the noun \\"conference.\\" Thus, the part-of-speech tag of the given word is JJ (Adjective). This is because it is describing the noun \\"conference\\" as being related to Australia. Part #2: Check if the part-of-speech tag of the given word matches the given POS tag. Usage: The given POS tag is DT (Determiner). We have already established that the part-of-speech tag of the word \\"Australian\\" is JJ (Adjective). Therefore, the given POS tag does not match the part-of-speech tag of the given word in the question. Part #3: Give your answer as True or False based on the comparison in Part #2. Usage: Since the part-of-speech tag of the given word, JJ (Adjective), does not match the given POS tag, DT (Determiner), the answer is False. This indicates that the part-of-speech of \\"Australian\\" in the question is not a determiner but is an adjective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. Logan but not Ian was sent home from work for the day because Choose from: [A]. Logan smelled like booze.; [B]. Ian smelled like booze.;","completion":"Logan but not Ian was sent home from work for the day because Logan smelled like booze. Despite the stark differences in their behaviors, it was clear that there was a problem that needed to be addressed. The day started like any other, with Logan and Ian clocking in at their usual time of 8:00 a.m. The two were known for being on time and reliable; they were tasked with important responsibilities in a fast-shifting environment. Their manager, Angela, was always appreciative of their punctuality and work ethic. Even though Angela noticed that Logan seemed a bit disheveled that morning, she didn't think too much of it initially. After all, everyone has off days, and perhaps Logan was just tired or not feeling well. Around mid-morning, however, a few of Logan's co-workers began raising concerns. They mentioned feeling uncomfortable with Logan's presence due to the strong smell of alcohol that seemed to be emanating from him. This was highly unusual for Logan, as he typically maintained a professional demeanor and appearance throughout the workday. Angela caught whiff of Logan's alcohol odor when she walked by him later that morning. Unwilling to overlook the situation, Angela decided she needed to have a conversation with Logan about his current state. She pulled him into her office to discuss the issue further. During this conversation, Logan initially denied having consumed any alcohol that morning. He seemed a bit defensive and attempted to brush off any concerns. Angela, however, was relentless, and after a few probing questions, Logan admitted that he had been drinking the previous night, stayed out much later than he planned, and didn't have time to shower or change before coming to work. He regretted doing so and in hindsight realized that it was impacting not only his own work but also the work environment for others. At this point, Angela was forced to make the difficult decision to send Logan home for the day. Despite typically being an upstanding employee, the fact that he came to work smelling so strongly of alcohol was a clear violation of the company's code of conduct, and it was affecting the team’s morale. Logan was asked to return the next day with a clear head and a commitment to maintaining a professional demeanor in the future. Meanwhile, Ian, who had never had any such issues in the past, continued with his day, focusing on his responsibilities and teamwork. He was troubled by the situation with Logan, as they had always gotten along well and Ian saw him as a role model in many ways. Nonetheless, Ian was determined to maintain his own professionalism and demonstrate respect for the company's policies and his co-workers' well-being. In the following days, Logan was given a chance to demonstrate remorse and show that he took the incident seriously. Angela monitored his progress closely and provided him with resources and support to ensure he could overcome any personal challenges that may have contributed to the incident. While the situation was certainly a wakeup call for Logan, it ultimately reinforced the importance of professionalism in the workplace and provided him with an opportunity to learn from his mistakes and grow as an individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Proper Way to Care for and Store Your Cast Iron Cookware Introduction Cast iron cookware has been a staple in kitchens for centuries, not just because of its durability but also because it offers superior heat retention and even cooking. However, owning a cast iron pan requires proper care and attention in order to maximize its potential and extend its lifespan. In this article, we will discuss the importance of drying, oiling, and reheating your cast iron kitchenware, as well as preventing moisture build-up during storage. Step 1: Dry it Immediately One of the most essential steps after using your cast iron cookware is making sure that it's thoroughly dried. Wet or damp cast iron can develop rust, which can compromise both the quality of your pan and the food you cook on it. After washing or rinsing your cast iron with warm water, thoroughly dry it using a towel or place it on low heat on a stovetop to evaporate any remaining moisture. Step 2: Oil it Back Up After ensuring that your cast iron piece is completely dry, it's vital to oil it back up. Oiling helps to maintain the seasoning and prevents the pan from rusting. Use a small amount of oil (vegetable oil, shortening, or flaxseed oil are all great options) and rub it all over the cooking surface using a paper towel or a lint-free cloth. A well-seasoned cast iron will not require frequent oiling, but it's a good habit to keep it lightly oiled, especially in humid environments. Step 3: Reheat It Preheating your cast iron cookware before storage is another important step in maintaining its quality. The heat helps to fully absorb the oil and create a protective barrier against moisture. Place your oiled pan on a low to medium heat until it's warm to the touch. You can also put it in the oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) for about 10 minutes. Step 4: Prevent Moisture Build-Up During Storage To prevent moisture from building up during storage, make sure to store your cast iron cookware in a cool, dry place. Avoid stacking other pots or pans on top of your cast iron as this can trap moisture and promote rust. To ensure proper airflow and to keep your cast iron pieces moisture-free, you can use a paper towel or a dry cloth inside your pan when storing it. This will also help to soak up any excess oil and prevent sticky buildup. Conclusion By following these basic steps, you'll not only prolong the life of your cast iron cookware but also ensure that you're getting the best possible cooking experience. A well-cared-for cast iron pan will serve you and your kitchen for a lifetime. So remember to dry, oil, reheat, and store your cast iron properly to make the most out of this kitchen essential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - \`\` Shakey Ground '' is a 1975 R&B single by The Temptations .

Goal: To color leather Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? 1. Use a sharpie; 2. Use a stain;...I think the answer is","completion":"2. Use a stain. While both methods can be used to color leather, using a leather stain (also called leather dye) is generally more reasonable and effective for accomplishing the goal of coloring the leather. Let's examine the differences between the two methods and explore why using a stain is the better option. 1. Using a Sharpie Sharpies are permanent markers that contain quick-drying ink. They can be used to color various surfaces, including leather. However, there are several drawbacks to using a Sharpie for this purpose: - Limited color options: Sharpies come in a limited range of colors compared to leather stains, restricting your ability to get the exact shade or finish you desire. - Inconsistent application: Applying ink from a Sharpie onto the leather surface can be uneven and streaky, leading to an unprofessional and amateurish finish. - Fading and rubbing off: Sharpie ink tends not to adhere well to leather and can fade or rub off over time, particularly when exposed to water, sunlight, or regular use. - Potential damage: Sharpies contain solvents that can potentially damage the leather, particularly if it has not been prepped and conditioned beforehand. 2. Using a Leather Stain Leather stains, also known as leather dyes, are specifically formulated to penetrate and color leather surfaces. They have several advantages over using a Sharpie: - Wide range of colors: Leather stains come in a vast array of colors, allowing you to achieve the exact shade and finish you want for your leather piece. - Consistent application: Leather stains are applied using a sponge, brush, or airbrush, resulting in a more even and consistent application without streaks or blotches. - Durability: Leather stains are specifically designed to bond with the leather's fibers and are resistant to fading, wear, and water damage. This ensures a long-lasting, professional-looking result. - Condition-enhancing properties: Many leather stains also contain conditioners and protectants that help nourish and preserve the leather, ensuring its durability and longevity. Before applying a leather stain, it is essential to prepare the leather properly. This may involve cleaning the surface, removing any existing finish or protective coating, and ensuring the leather is dry and ready for dyeing. Once you've applied the stain, it's crucial to follow up with a leather sealer or finish to protect the newly colored surface and maintain its vibrancy and durability. In conclusion, while both Sharpies and leather stains can be used to color leather, using a stain is generally more reasonable and yields better results. Leather stains provide a wider range of colors, better application consistency, increased durability, and added conditioning properties to enhance the quality and longevity of the leather piece."},{"prompt":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Given the background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. and the situation: Two neighboring towns from Texas produced their food in different ways.

Answer the following question: Which town played its part in causing a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ? The answer is:","completion":"Gold town played its part in causing a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Since Gold town used fertilizers and pesticides in their agricultural practices, these chemicals were likely washed away by rain and carried through runoff into nearby rivers. These rivers eventually drain into the Gulf of Mexico, bringing the fertilizers (rich in nitrogen) with them. The excess nitrogen promotes the growth of algae, leading to algal blooms that consume carbon dioxide and eventually die. Decomposers break down the dead algae, using up the oxygen in the water, and thereby creating a dead zone where little to no aquatic life can survive due to the low oxygen levels. On the other hand, Silver town, which practiced sustainable agriculture without the use of fertilizers or pesticides, did not contribute to the creation of a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; Dutch: [a:'ja:n 'hi:rsi 'a:li] ( listen); born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. Hirsi Ali arrived in the Netherlands in 1992. That year she had travelled from Kenya to visit her family in Dusseldorf and Bonn, Germany and gone to the Netherlands to escape an alleged arranged marriage. Once there, she requested political asylum and obtained a residence permit. She used her paternal grandfather's early surname on her application and has since been known in the West as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She received a residence permit within three or four weeks of arriving in the Netherlands. At first she held various short-term jobs, ranging from cleaning to sorting post. She worked as a translator at a Rotterdam refugee center which, according to a friend interviewed in 2006 by The Observer newspaper, marked her deeply. As an avid reader, in the Netherlands she found new books and ways of thought that both stretched her imagination and frightened her. Sigmund Freud's work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in Driebergen. She has said that she was impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at Leiden University, obtaining an MSc degree in political science in 2000. Between 1995 and 2001, Hirsi Ali also worked as an independent Somali-Dutch interpreter and translator, frequently working with Somali women in asylum centers, hostels for abused women, and at the Dutch immigration and naturalization service (IND, Immigratie en Naturalisatiedienst). While working for the IND, she became critical of the way it handled asylum seekers. As a result of her education and experiences, Hirsi Ali speaks six languages: English, Somali, Arabic, Swahili, Amharic, and Dutch. how many languages does she speak","completion":"Ayaan Hirsi Ali is fluent in six languages: English, Somali, Arabic, Swahili, Amharic, and Dutch. Her language skills have been instrumental in her work as an interpreter and translator, as well as in her activism, authorship, and political career. Throughout her educational and professional experiences in the Netherlands and later in the United States, Hirsi Ali has been able to effectively communicate and share her ideas, perspectives, and experiences across various cultures and linguistic communities. Her multilingualism has been valuable in her advocacy for women's rights, human rights, and the reform of Islam, as it allows her to engage with a diverse range of individuals and organizations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. Now, I have a new situation: Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. Answer this question please: Which milk would be coagulated, bottle A or bottle B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bottle B would be coagulated. In the situation described, Dan made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. Bottle A milk was kept intact and not subjected to any curdling process. Therefore, the milk in bottle B has been coagulated, whereas the milk in bottle A remains in its original, uncoagulated state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It's impossible to say While \\"New World\\" is certainly a notable film in Park Hoon-jung's career, it is impossible to definitively say whether this is the work he is best known for without an overview of his entire body of work and the reception of his other films/projects. The film is an important piece in his career, and being the first entry in a planned trilogy does add to its significance. However, to say Park Hoon-jung is \\"best known\\" for \\"New World\\" requires a broader analysis and understanding of his prominence within the industry and the reception of his other works. Park Hoon-jung is a South Korean screenwriter, film director and producer, who began his career as a screenwriter before transitioning to directing. Over his career, he has been involved in the creation of various films and projects. To establish whether \\"New World\\" is his most notable work, one would need to assess each of his projects in terms of their critical acclaim, box office success, cultural impact, and overall recognition within the film industry. Some other works by Park Hoon-jung include films like \\"I Saw the Devil\\" (2010), which he wrote, and \\"The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion\\" (2018), which he directed. Both of these films have also garnered attention and acclaim, and it is possible that he is also well-known for these works.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Your gifts and talents will help you succeed, but they can only do so if you know what they are. You need to be self-aware enough to use and hone the gifts you already have. Start by thinking about the areas in which you excel. What comes easiest to you? In which subjects did you always do well in school? What do you breeze through at work? Ask your friends, family, and co-workers for feedback. Often, they can see talents that you're blind to. For instance, maybe you have a natural ability to talk anyone into anything. You may not even notice that ability, yet it's a skill that comes in handy in many fields. You could ask your friends, \\"I'm trying to become more self-aware. Can you tell me what you think my strengths and weaknesses are?\\" It's also equally important to know your challenges, so you can work on those areas. Listen when you do receive feedback from others, either solicited or unsolicited, as that will help you learn where you can grow. For example, if a friend says, \\"You're starting another new project? What happened to the last one?\\" you may realize that you aren't following through on your projects. Studies have shown that kids who are praised for their effort rather than for the result are more likely to develop a growth mindset. That's because they become focused on the process rather than the the end result. You can use that to your own benefit by rewarding yourself for your hard work, rather than just the end result. For every designated length of time that you work on something, reward yourself with a fun break or treat. This can help keep your focus on the effort. Or if you tried a new recipe at home, something you find difficult, you probably would normally tell yourself, \\"That's so delicious!\\" While that's not bad necessarily, you should also think about the process, telling yourself, \\"I'm proud of myself for trying out a new recipe and working so hard on it.\\" A qualified counselor or therapist can help you identify negative thinking patterns and other roadblocks toward developing a growth mindset. A therapist can make an assessment of your personal relationships, your professional development, and personal experiences. They can also give you \\"tools\\" to combat negative thoughts, improve your self esteem, and offer support when you experience setbacks.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of self-awareness in identifying and utilizing one's gifts and talents for success, suggesting strategies to discover personal strengths and weaknesses, develop a growth mindset, seek feedback from others, focus on effort rather than outcomes, rewarding oneself for hard work, and considering professional help such as counseling or therapy to overcome negative thought patterns and develop a more robust positive mindset for personal and professional growth."},{"prompt":"Lee decided to make a cake for the holiday coming up.

It does not indicate a peaceful or well-thought-out creation. 2. \\"Virulent\\" - This word has a strong negative connotation, as it is often used to describe something that is extremely harmful and poisonous. In this context, it can be inferred that the picture is very offensive or malicious. 3. \\"Foul-natured\\" - This phrase indicates that the picture has a bad or unpleasant disposition, which contributes to the overall unfavorable sentiment. 4. \\"Delivered by a Hollywood studio\\" - This part of the sentence implies that the source of the Christmas season picture is a large and influential studio, which only amplifies the negative sentiment, as it highlights that such a well-known entity could produce such a distasteful creation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Starr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group including Buddy Rich, William F. Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \\"Photograph\\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \\"Honey Don't\\" at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, he released the album Ringo Rama, which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \\"Never Without You\\". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs.Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \\"a Starr in the east\\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition. His 2005 release Choose Love eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9 Madryn Street, stating that it had \\"no historical significance\\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.Starr released the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart. Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters... The answer to this question is:","completion":"George \\"Never Without You\\" was written as a tribute to George Harrison, a former bandmate of Ringo Starr in The Beatles.

However, it is important to note that this description pertains to the flag used by Libya from 1977 to 2011, during the period of Muammar Gaddafi's leadership. The flag was also known as the \\"Green Banner of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\\" The Libyan flag from 1977 to 2011 was unique in its simplicity, as it was the only national flag in the world that consisted of a single color and had no other emblems, insignias, or design elements. The green color on the flag symbolized various aspects of Libyan society and culture, including Islam, which is the predominant religion in the country. Green is also a color associated with the Gaddafi-led political ideology of the Jamahiriya, which was a system that aimed to combine elements of socialism, Arab nationalism, and direct democracy. Additionally, green in the flag was intended to represent Gaddafi's \\"Green Book,\\" a political manifesto authored by Gaddafi outlining his vision for a utopian socialist society in Libya. The Green Book served as the main guiding document for the policies and principles of the Libyan government during this period. In 2011, the iconic green flag was replaced amidst the Libyan Civil War and the eventual fall of Gaddafi's regime. Libya's new flag was introduced by the National Transitional Council, which took over the governance of the country after the end of the conflict. The current flag of Libya consists of three horizontal stripes: red on top, black in the middle, and green at the bottom. At the center of the black stripe, there is a white crescent and star, which are symbols of Islam. This design reverts to the flag used by the Kingdom of Libya from 1951 to 1969 and is meant to signify a return to the values of unity, freedom, and independence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is left to his thoughts? from the following article ? The film opens with an English schoolteacher, Gwen Mayfield, packing up her belongings at a mission school in colonial Africa. The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits. The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby.

Danny felt sick and went to the doctor where he found out he had been infected with hepatitis B. Paul was ok and didn't require medical attention. But I can use this background: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B. What is an answer for this question: Which friend experienced more yellowing of the skin? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Danny is the friend who experienced more yellowing of the skin since he was infected with hepatitis B, which causes yellowing of the skin and eyes.

The paragraph states that Judith Miller is a reporter who was jailed for refusing to reveal the identity of a US-government source, who had identified Valerie Plame, a member of the CIA. The information only establishes her as a journalist and implies her involvement in a particular news story related to the US government and the CIA. It is important to note that journalists and reporters often cover stories that involve government actions, sources, and classified information. But being involved in such coverage does not necessarily imply that they themselves are government employees. To determine if Judith Miller works for the US Government, we would need additional information about her role, employer, and professional history. For instance, if she were a reporter for a private media organization, it would imply that she does not work for the US Government. Conversely, if she were employed by a government-run media agency or held an official position as a press practitioner within a government department, then we could infer that she works for the US Government.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. and the situation: Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Answer the following question: Which pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information and the situation provided, it is likely that the Mobutu pack would have more difficulty targeting prey animals than the Simba pack. The main reasons for this conclusion are as follows: 1. Confusion due to large group size: As mentioned in the background information, individuals living in large groups are generally safer from predators due to the confusion effect. The Mobutu pack is following large groups of zebras and other grazers, making it more challenging for them to target a single animal efficiently. In contrast, the Simba pack is ambushing wounded individual prey animals, which are easier to target as they are isolated. 2. Disruptive coloration of zebra stripes: The striped patterns of the zebras are known to have a disruptive effect on predator focusing abilities. When zebras are in a group, their stripes create an optical illusion, making it difficult for predators like lions to focus on a single zebra or determine where one zebra begins and another ends. The Mobutu pack is primarily following herds of zebras, so they are more likely to experience the confusing effects of the zebra stripes. The Simba pack, on the other hand, is targeting wounded individual animals, which may not necessarily be zebras, thus avoiding the disruptive effects of the zebra stripes. 3. Motion dazzle effect: When zebras move rapidly, their stripes tend to create a flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. This effect further increases the difficulty in targeting individual zebras for the Mobutu pack, as they are following herds of fast-moving grazers. The Simba pack, however, targets wounded individuals who may not be able to move as fast, thus not provoking the same motion dazzle effect. Considering these factors, the Mobutu pack, which is focusing on hunting large groups of zebras and other grazers, is more likely to face challenges in efficiently targeting individual prey animals compared to the Simba pack, which is targeting wounded, isolated prey animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As she goes to pass, her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction, then slammed full-force by the Mack, killing her. Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: 250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something.

Given the following context: San Francisco—officially known as the City and County of San Francisco—is a consolidated city-county, a status it has held since the 1856 secession of what is now San Mateo County. It is the only such consolidation in California. The mayor is also the county executive, and the county Board of Supervisors acts as the city council. The government of San Francisco is a charter city and is constituted of two co-equal branches. The executive branch is headed by the mayor and includes other citywide elected and appointed officials as well as the civil service. The 11-member Board of Supervisors, the legislative branch, is headed by a president and is responsible for passing laws and budgets, though San Franciscans also make use of direct ballot initiatives to pass legislation. The members of the Board of Supervisors are elected as representatives of specific districts within the city. Upon the death or resignation of mayor, the President of the Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board elects an interim replacement for the remainder of the term. In 1978, Dianne Feinstein assumed the office following the assassination of George Moscone and was later selected by the board to finish the term. In 2011, Edwin M. Lee was selected by the board to finish the term of Gavin Newsom, who resigned to take office as Lieutenant Governor of California. Lee (who won 2 elections to remain mayor) was temporarily replaced by San Francisco Board of Supervisors President London Breed after he died on December 12, 2017. Supervisor Mark Farrell was appointed by the Board of Supervisors to finish Lee's term on January 23, 2018. answer the following question: What is the name of the county and that seceded from another county in 1856?","completion":"The name of the county that seceded from another county in 1856 is San Mateo County."},{"prompt":"The answer to the question: What is the name of the person whose only remining artifact is a pocket watch? is inside the article: During a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, a girl becomes the latest victim of the deadly virus \\"XB\\".

Lurz, an industrialist with an office in a Berlin high-rise, informs his American headquarters that the company has difficulty selling its security-related computer systems to the West German government in Bonn. Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting. They are: August Brem, the ringleader; Susanne's composer husband Edgar; feminist history professor Hilde Krieger; Petra Vielhabor, a housewife who is constantly arguing with her banker husband Hans; and Rudolf Mann, a clerk in a record store. P.J. Lurz is informed by Gerhard Gast, the inspector-general of the police, that he is being watched and is under police protection. Gast has also arrived to pick up Susanne, his daughter-in-law. En route to their home, Susanne and Gerhard stop at a hotel room and have sex. They have been carrying on an affair with sado-masochistic undertones. The Gast family has dinner together: Gerhardt, Susanne, her husband Edgar, the caustic grandfather, the delusional pianist grandmother and the young coupleâs small son. During dinner Grandpa Gast tells Edgar that every generation needs a war. The terrorists gather at Rudolfâs large apartment, but August is annoyed by the presence of Rudolfâs roommate Ilse Hoffman, a drug addict. August sees her as a threat to their secret activities.

In designating the al-Nusra Front as a foreign terrorist organization and an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq, the U.S. State Department has put flesh on the bones of its policy of discriminating between the \\"bad\\" Syrian rebels and the \\"good\\" ones. But the decision is getting mixed reviews in Syria. Rebels in brigades fighting around Aleppo have told CNN that the move is a miscalculation. Their argument goes something like this: \\"The U.S. and the West in general have given us next to no help while we've witnessed thousands die at the hands of Bashar al-Assad's heavy weaponry and dominance of the skies. \\"Al-Nusra Front is one of many groups that are fighting the","completion":"Assad regime, and while we may not agree with their extremist ideology, they are currently a necessary ally in defeating the government forces. The U.S. designation will only alienate them further and make the fight against the regime more challenging. \\"Instead of focusing on labeling certain groups as 'good' or 'bad,' the international community should consider a comprehensive approach to supporting all anti-Assad forces, including providing humanitarian aid, military training, and potentially a no-fly zone over Syria to protect civilians and opposition fighters from air raids.\\" Critics of the U.S. decision argue that such binary distinctions among the rebels could undermine the opposition's overall goal of toppling the Assad regime and lead to further divisions within the rebel ranks. On the other hand, supporters of the move say that it is crucial to make a clear distinction between moderate rebel groups fighting for democracy and those tied to extremist, terrorist organizations. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the U.S. State Department's decision will depend on whether it incites divisions among the Syrian opposition or leads to more collaborative efforts to defeat Assad's forces and bring about a better future for Syria. As the conflict continues, it remains to be seen how these political maneuvers will impact the situation on the ground."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 2: When I share my posts on Facebook below the post it shows a name of which is the designer of the theme how to remove that name? Select from: [+] no. [+] yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Answer 1: No, winds are not always higher pressure air. Winds are caused by differences in air pressure, and they flow from areas of high pressure to those of low pressure. The difference in pressure is what drives the wind movement. When the difference in pressure is greater, the wind speed increases too. It is important to note that wind is a naturally occurring and dynamic process that depends on various factors such as the Earth's rotation, differences in temperature and humidity, and other regional and local factors that contribute to the creation of pressure differences. Answer 2: To remove the designer's name from the posts you share on Facebook, you need to edit the theme code in the backend of your website. The process might differ depending on the platform and theme you are using, but the general idea is to find the source code responsible for displaying the designer's name and remove or hide it from display. Please follow these steps to attempt this removal: 1. Log in to your website admin panel. 2. Navigate to the theme editor or the area where you can access the theme files. 3. Look for the file responsible for displaying the information in your shared posts. This could be a header.php, footer.php, or a variety of other files depending on your theme structure. You could use the \\"Find\\" feature to narrow down the location of the designer's name in the source code. 4. Once you find the designer's name, either delete the relevant code snippet or hide it by wrapping it with CSS style display property, such as: \`<span style=\\"display:none;\\">Designer's Name</span>\` 5. Save your changes and refresh your website to make sure the designer's name is removed or hidden. 6.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? It was more likely that Michael would get diabetes than Randy because","completion":"It was more likely that Michael would get diabetes than Randy because Michael had a combination of risk factors, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle habits that significantly increased his likelihood of developing the condition. Firstly, Michael's family had a strong history of type 2 diabetes. Both his parents and a few of his siblings were diagnosed with the condition in their adult years. Genetics plays a crucial role in determining an individual's susceptibility to diabetes, and a strong family history can considerably increase that risk. Secondly, Michael's body mass index (BMI) had been consistently high since his teenage years. Obesity is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. As a person's BMI increases, so does their risk of developing the disease. In Michael's case, his BMI was consistently over 30, putting him in the obese category and further increasing his chances of diabetes. In addition, Michael led a predominantly sedentary lifestyle which contributed to his weight gain and overall health. He often took the elevator instead of the stairs, spent long hours in front of screens at work, and rarely engaged in physical exercise. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to insulin resistance, a condition in which the body is unable to utilize insulin properly. Insulin resistance is a significant contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes. Poor dietary choices also put Michael at a higher risk of developing diabetes. He frequently indulged in high-calorie, high-carbohydrate, and high-fat foods, such as fast food, sugary snacks, and processed meals. These types of food can cause blood sugar levels to spike, putting additional stress on the body's insulin-producing cells. Over time, this can lead to the development of diabetes. Moreover, Michael was a heavy smoker and engaged in excessive alcohol consumption. Both cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol intake are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Smoking can lead to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which can contribute to the development of insulin resistance. In the case of alcohol, excessive consumption can lead to weight gain, and it can also harm the pancreas, the organ responsible for producing insulin. Contrastingly, Randy was at a lower risk for diabetes, as he led a healthier lifestyle. He maintained a healthy weight, engaged in regular physical activity, and his diet consisted of balanced meals with whole grains, lean proteins, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Moreover, Randy was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol in moderation. While he may not be entirely exempt from developing diabetes, his combination of genetic and lifestyle factors significantly reduced his likelihood in comparison to Michael. In conclusion, Michael's increased likelihood of developing diabetes in comparison to Randy was due to a combination of genetic factors, an unhealthy diet, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. It is essential to recognize and manage these risk factors to prevent the onset of diabetes and maintain overall health and wellbeing."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence, fill out the missing word with a 'no' or a number (between zero and ten).

I remember seeing this when it was released, in a theater in Palo Alto, and not expecting much. I mean -- an Australian movie? But it finally got to me. Here's a scene. Richard Chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in Sidney, facing an Australian aborigine elder named Charlie. Chamberlain: \\"You were outside my house last night. You frightened my wife. Who are you?\\" And Charlie at a deliberate pace replies, \\"Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?. . . . Are you a fish? Are you a snake? Are you a man? . . . . Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?\\" It's a stunning scene, shot all in close ups, with Chamberlain's blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to Charlie's black, broad-nosed, bearded visage. The two guys couldn't be more different and this film is the story of how Chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable, almost unspeakable, mysteries of Charlie's world. I don't think I'll go on much about the plot. It's kind of an apocalyptic tale. But I must say, whoever did the research on Australian aboriginal belief systems should get an A plus. They've got everything in here, from pointing the bone to the dream time, a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real. It's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects. Charly's world simply begins to intrude into Chamberlain's dreams, for reasons never made entirely clear. If there's a problem with the script, that's it. Nothing is ever made entirely clear. Does Chamberlain, who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines, die in the last wave? Do the aborigines? Does the entirety of Sidney? The basic premise is a little hard to accept too, though granted that this is a fantasy. The aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that Americans bestow on American Indians, whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying -- more elegant and beautiful, if you like -- mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary, demanding, and sometimes disappointing physical existence. The mysticism of Charlie is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" but they're brothers under the skin. But I don't care about that. Taken as a film, this one is pretty good, and it's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director, Peter Weir, and the Australian film industry. This was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes, some of them raucous, like \\"Mad Max,\\" and some subtle and dramatic, like \\"Lantana.\\" I like Weir's stuff, which resembles Nicholas Roeg's in being pregnant with subliminal dread. Try \\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\\" for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood.

Mandarin Chinese is spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. It has more native speakers than other forms of Chinese. Xie does not translate directly into English, but when spoken as xiè xie, it means \\"Thanks\\" and \\"'xiè xie nǐ\\" means \\"Thank you.\\" A rough pronunciation of xiè xie is syeh-syeh. The first xiè starts high and drops by the end. The second xie is a neutral tone, meaning it is said lightly and without any emphasis. In simplified Chinese characters, xiè xie is 谢谢. In traditional Chinese characters, it would be 謝謝。 Other \\"thank you\\" sayings involving xie xie include \\"xiè xiè nín de bāng zhù,\\" (谢 谢 您 的 帮 助) a formal way of saying \\"thanks for your help,\\" and \\"xiè xiè nǐ bāng wǒ,\\" (谢谢 你 帮 我) a casual way of saying \\"Thanks for your help. This phrase translates roughly into “where, where!” The Chinese culture values humility, and saying “thank you” in response to a compliment can come off as being a little arrogant. By saying “where, where,” you are essentially deflecting the compliment. Within the U.S. culture, it would be similar to saying “shucks.” A rough pronunciation of this response would be na-ha-lee na-ha-lee. In simplified Chinese characters, this response is written as 哪里哪里. In traditional Chinese characters, it would be 哪裡哪裡. As with nǎlǐ, nǎlǐ, responding with bù, bù, bù is a way to politely deflect compliments. This response is similar to saying \\"no, no, no\\" in English. The number of times you say \\"bù\\" can vary depending on how strong your denial needs to be. The greater the compliment, the stronger the denial. A rough pronunciation of bù, bù, bù would be bhoo bhoo bhoo. Write bù in Chinese as 不.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1–2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature, circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze through capillaries. This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element. Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6). Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you will see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur, relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells, whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes. Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the... Q: As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other what?

It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \\"great Alachua Savannah.\\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds. The Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park is open year round. The Florida Park Service works hard so that the park will appear as it did in the past. It offers many opportunities for recreation. At the park you can camp and picnic. You can hike and bike. You can boat and fish. You can ride on horse trails. And you can see lots of nature and wildlife.

Carlsen finishes the historic victory with a 6.5 to 3.5 score, having won twice as black and once as white. Magnus Carlsen is only 22, so because of his youth there's a lot of talk about \\"the passing the torch\\" to a new generation of players. At 43, Anand is from of the era of Kasparov (50) and other greats from the '90s. But to just focus on the age of the players misses the even bigger symbolism, which is that we're entering a totally new post-modern era of human chess. In the old days, high-level chess was a swashbuckling game filled with daring piece sacrifices and head-spinning multi-move combinations where the winner would pull off wins seemingly out of nowhere. Here's a beautiful game from 1857, where the American player Paul Morphy (playing as black) sacrificed his queen on his way to a crushing victory. You can quickly click the arrow buttons below to play through the game fast, and see how Morphy dominated his opponent despite his lack of a queen. This era of chess is also known as the \\"romantic\\" era. Between the daringness and drama of this, it's not hard to see why. As the study of chess became more rigorous, these wild games became more and more rare at the highest level, as daring (but theoretically weak) combinations became more easy to repel. That doesn't mean chess players stopped winning games via jaw-dropping combinations. This 1956 match between Donald Byrne and Bobby Fischer is sometimes called The Game Of The Century. Fischer was just 13 (!!) when he won by sacrificing his queen on move 17, only to win 24 moves later. Sadly (for fans) these kind of ridiculous-looking games have gotten more rare. Modern chess champions have won by building crushing, airtight, positional superiorities against their opponents, grinding them down and forcing a resignation. The chess is amazing, although frequently less of a high-wire act. Which brings us to the current match between Carlsen and Anand. After the first two games of the best-of-12 series, we lamented that the tournament was off to a disastrous start. The first two games were totally boring draws, with neither player comfortable going off \\"book.\\" In other words, the players spend so much time studying positions (and their opponents' play) with computers that by the time the players get to the table, much of the gamesmanship is already finished. There's a lot of hesitation to uncork a novelty on the board if it isn't something that's been backed up by hours of analysis by software programs (which at this point are better at chess than actual humans). Since those first two games, things have gotten more exciting, which is obvious as Carlsen has won three games. But the manner of the victories is interesting and tells us something important. In each game, Anand had decent chances to draw, but made some late-game blunder that gave Carlsen the victory. In today's match, actually, Anand playing as white had the initiative with a strong pawn position bearing down on Carlsen's castled king. But Anand blundered at the end, allowing Carlsen to gain an extra queen, without a clear chance to mate. Anand definitely had winning chances and probably could have drawn, but he screwed up. // var cbeOptions = { layout: \\"1\\", room: \\"cbtest-wcc1\\", game: \\"09-Anand_Viswanathan-Carlsen_Magnus\\", annotations: true }; // Live chess broadcast powered by ChessBomb and Chessdom This is, essentially how all the decisive games have gone. There's a chance for a draw, and Anand cracks under the pressure, while Magnus plays flaw-free chess. Magnus is just crushing Anand on the psychological game. And he does it in multiple ways. For one thing, if you've been watching the game you see that Magnus frequently just gets up and walks away from the table after he moves, which has to be unnerving. Also this is fascinating, from Tyler Cowen (via Kottke): Second, Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his \\"nettlesomeness,\\" to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan. Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response. This is our new era of post-modern chess. It's not about uncorking crazy, romantic brilliancies. And it's not about achieving crushing, positional victories. It's about being as cool as a computer while your opponent does things that are, well, human. ||||| The Chess World Championship is currently underway in Chennai, India. Through nine games, challenger and world #1 Magnus Carlsen is leading reigning world champ and world #8 Viswanathan Anand by the score of 6-3. It seems as though Carlsen’s nettlesomeness is contributing to his good fortunes. Second, Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his “nettlesomeness,” to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan.

Or perhaps Carlsen’s just inspired by the lovely chess set they’re using? Either way, he needs just one draw in the remaining three games to win the Championship. Or putting it another way, Anand has to win all three of the remaining games to retain the title. ||||| World number one Magnus Carlsen toppled local favourite Viswanathan Anand in Chennai to add the world chess championship title to his already impressive resume on Friday. A draw in the crucial 10th game after 65 moves of play gave the young Norwegian an unassailable lead in the 12-match contest and put an end to Anand’s hopes of retaining the FIDE title he’s held since 2007. Carlsen, about a week shy of his 23rd birthday, led 6-3 before Friday’s game and needed just a draw to become the first champion from the West since American Bobby Fischer’s reign ended in 1975. “I really hope that this could have positive effects for chess both in Norway and worldwide,” Carlsen said at the post-match news conference. Anand, who has slumped to eighth in the rankings, did not win a game in a series billed as the “War of the Wizards”. In this battle of youth and experience that kicked off on Nov. 9, both players started out with draws before the Norwegian won the fifth and sixth games to pull ahead. Anand drew the next two games before Carlsen prevailed in the ninth. On Friday, Anand was playing with black pieces — a disadvantage as white moves first — and could not make much headway in a game that lasted nearly five hours. The world title was the one accomplishment that had eluded Carlsen, often called the “Mozart of chess”. He earned the right to challenge Anand by virtue of winning the candidates’ tournament in April. The baby-faced Norwegian wasn’t even born when Anand became India’s first grandmaster in 1988 and was just 10 when Anand won the first of his five world titles in 2000. A grandmaster since he was 13, Carlsen now has the highest rating in the history of the game, breaking chess great Garry Kasparov’s record this year. He became the world’s number one at age 19, the youngest player ever to do so. Kasparov, who coached Carlsen for a while, described him as “a type of Harry Potter” destined “to leave a deep mark” on the game. A household name in India, Anand is widely credited with firing up the nation’s passion for chess more than two decades ago. Friday’s result was a disappointment for the 43-year-old, who had been the undisputed world champion since 2007. “This year, I’ve had a lot of problems with mistakes creeping into my game,” Anand said at the post-match news conference. “(Losing) the fifth game was a heavy blow,” he said, adding that it was time for him “to take stock”. The 2013 championship, played on a glass-encased, soundproof stage at five-star hotel in Chennai, drew unprecedented media interest, despite reams of newsprint and TV coverage devoted to Sachin Tendulkar’s swansong series happening concurrently in cricket-crazy India. More than 100 million TV viewers in India and Norway watched the chess championship broadcast, organisers said on the championship website. This year, the chess title comes with a cash prize of 1.5 million for Carlsen while Anand will receive around 1 million.

Carlsen finished with a 6.5 to 3.5 score, winning twice as black and once as white. At only 22 years old, Carlsen's victory has sparked conversations about \\"the passing of the torch\\" to a new generation of players. Anand, at 43 years old, is from the era of Kasparov and other great players from the 1990s. However, focusing merely on the age difference overlooks the larger symbolism: the arrival of a new post-modern era in human chess. In the past, high-level chess games were filled with daring piece sacrifices and multi-move combinations, with winners often emerging unexpectedly. This was known as the \\"romantic\\" era of chess. However, as the study of chess became more rigorous, these wild games gradually decreased at the highest level, as daring combinations were more easily defended. While stunning combinations still occurred, they became rarer. Modern chess champions have typically achieved victory by building crushing positional advantages against their opponents, gradually wearing them down and forcing a resignation. However, the current match between Carlsen and Anand represents a turning point. In each game, Anand made a late-game blunder, allowing Carlsen to seize the win. Carlsen has displayed exceptional psychological skills, forcing Anand into uncomfortable positions and capitalizing on his mistakes. Carlsen's playstyle emphasizes pressuring his opponent with creative moves, opening up opportunities for errors. This approach, combined with his unshakeable demeanor, highlight the dawn of a new era in post-modern chess. The focus has shifted from risky combinations and positional dominance to maintaining the cool efficiency of a computer while forcing your opponent to reveal their human flaws."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Drinking an ample amount of water is essential for maintaining a healthy body and mind. Proper hydration plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, such as digestion, absorption of nutrients, circulation, and temperature regulation. Furthermore, consuming enough water can help prevent dehydration, fatigue, and even headaches, ensuring that your body functions optimally. Moreover, adding diluted fruit or vegetable juice to your daily fluid intake can provide additional benefits. These juices contain vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can contribute to improved overall health, especially during periods of high physical activity or stress. When diluting fruit or vegetable juices, it is essential to strike the right balance between water and juice. Too much water may dilute the nutrient content, while too little water can lead to excessive sugar intake, which could be counterproductive to your health goals. A good rule of thumb is to mix equal parts water and juice, or adjust according to personal taste and nutritional preferences. During periods of increased physical activity or exposure to high temperatures, it is crucial to consume at least 2-3 litres of fluids daily. This amount may vary depending on individual needs, activity levels, and climate conditions. It is essential to listen to your body and adjust your water and juice consumption accordingly. In conclusion, staying well-hydrated is a critical factor in maintaining good health and well-being.

The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian Max Jakob Friedländer's pioneering Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance. Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It was not until the late 1950s, after the...","completion":"Erwin"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Does the sentence \\"In the 20th century after decades of intense warfare and political turmoil terms such as \\"Near East\\", \\"Far East\\" and \\"Middle East\\" were relegated to the experts, especially in the new field of political science.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where did the new wave of diplomats often come from?\\"","completion":"No, the given sentence does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where did the new wave of diplomats often come from?\\" The sentence primarily discusses how terms like \\"Near East,\\" \\"Far East,\\" and \\"Middle East\\" became specialized terminology used by experts, particularly in the field of political science, as a result of 20th-century warfare and political turmoil. To provide a valid answer to the question, we should focus on the factors and sources that contributed to the emergence of new diplomats. A more useful response to that question might look something like this: The new wave of diplomats during the 20th century often came from a variety of educational backgrounds and professional experiences, as the complex international political landscape necessitated a wider range of expertise and skills. Two primary factors contributing to this new wave of diplomats were the end of colonialism and the emergence of newly independent nations, as well as the rise of international organizations and institutions aimed at fostering collaboration and communication among countries. Firstly, the end of World War II and the process of decolonization that followed led to the birth of many new countries around the world. These newly independent nations required diplomatic representatives to engage with other countries and international organizations, promoting their interests and fostering cooperation on various issues. Consequently, many of the new wave diplomats were individuals who had either been involved in national liberation struggles or who possessed knowledge, experience, and connections relevant to their country's position in the global arena. Secondly, the establishment of international institutions and organizations such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund called for professional diplomats who had a deep understanding of global politics, economics, and law. Accordingly, the new wave of diplomats often originated from backgrounds in academia, law, business, or military service, utilizing these diverse skills to navigate the intricate sphere of international diplomacy effectively. In summary, while the sentence about the usage of terms like \\"Near East,\\" \\"Far East,\\" and \\"Middle East\\" provides insight into the complexity of 20th-century geopolitics, it does not directly address the origins of the new wave of diplomats. A valid response to the question should focus on the changes in the political landscape and the increased need for skilled professionals with diverse backgrounds capable of managing international relations and representing their countries in a rapidly evolving global environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On Monday , a suicide car bomber blew himself up close to the United Nations compound in Baghdad , also killing a security guard . (See options at the end). If the first sentence is true, is the second one also true? Possible answers: A). no; B). yes;","completion":"To determine if the second sentence can also be true, let's compare the key points in both sentences: 1. Both events occurred on Monday. 2. Both involved a suicide bomber. 3. Both took place near the United Nations compound. 4. Both resulted in the death of a security guard along with the suicide bomber. The only noticeable difference between the two sentences is that the first one does not specify the location, while the second one indicates that the event occurred in Baghdad. I will now justify my answer step by step: Step 1: Determine if there are any contradictions in the key points. - There are no contradictions, as both sentences share the same key points. Step 2: Analyze the additional information in the second sentence. - The second sentence specifies the location as Baghdad, which does not conflict with the first sentence, as it does not mention a location. Step 3: Evaluate if the first sentence being true allows for the second sentence to be true as well. - Given that there are no contradictions and the additional detail in the second sentence does not conflict with the first, the first sentence being true would also allow for the possibility of the second sentence being true. Based on these steps, I can conclude that if the first sentence is true, the second one can be true as well. Therefore, the answer is: B). yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens in 1963 in the town of Hemingford in western Nebraska, which is in the middle of a severe drought. In a tent out in the vast cornfields, a young boy, claiming that the Old Testament-era Canaanite God whom he calls \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" had spoken to him in his dreams, telling the other children that the sinful and blasphemous adults are the reason for their recent troubles (making a comparison to the corruption in Sodom and Gomorrah). The boy preacher tells the children that they must kill everybody age 19 and over in town; leading them to found a death cult with a prime rule that, once reaching the age of nineteen, one must be sacrificed to the cult's God.Twelve years later in the year 1975, a constantly bickering couple consisting of Vietnam veteran Burt (David Anders) and his wife Vicky (Kandyse McClure) are driving along a back road near Gatlin, Nebraska, planning on celebrating their second honeymoon in California, when a boy named Joseph (Ramington Jennings) stumbles out of the roadside corn and in front of their car. Accidentally running Joseph over, Burt assesses his body and realizes the boy's throat was slashed. After wrapping and placing Joseph's body in the trunk, Burt tells Vicky to wait for him while he looks around with shotgun in hand. Among the corn, Burt finds Joseph's bloodied suitcase and takes it with him back to the car. He and Vicky drive off in search of aid, not realizing they were being watched by Isaac (Preston Bailey), the nine-year-old boy preacher and current cult leader, and his most loyal follower, the 18-year-old warrior Malachai (Daniel Newman).After hearing a group of children giving an evangelical sermon over the radio, Burt and Vicky reach an abandoned gas station before deciding to go to Gatlin after finding the phones non-functional. While Burt drives, Vicky manages to open Joseph's suitcase and finds a tribal-looking barbaric amulet inside which she recognizes as a pagan creation.Meanwhile, in the cornfields in a small clearing, Isaac tells the... Answer:","completion":"\\"Whispers of the Cornfield: The Cult of Sinful Harvest\\" The movie title, \\"Whispers of the Cornfield: The Cult of Sinful Harvest\\" captures the essence of the chilling premise that revolves around a small town consumed by a child-led death cult, with the cornfields as the central backdrop. The title primarily highlights the tale of a mysterious, ancient deity called \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows,\\" whose whispers instigate the grotesque acts that take place in the seemingly serene cornfields. The words \\"sinful harvest\\" in the title refer to the twisted interpretation of the Old Testament the cult leader, Isaac, uses to justify the murders of adults aged 19 and over and to demonstrate his edgy perspective on Sodom and Gomorrah. This provocative title also embodies the chilling feeling of horror that runs through the story as Burt and Vicky, the bickering couple, become entwined with these sinister happenings, exposing the viewers to a profoundly unsettling scenario. In summary, \\"Whispers of the Cornfield: The Cult of Sinful Harvest\\" encapsulates the dark aura that permeates the movie's plot, hinting at the gruesome revelations waiting to be discovered within the cornfields. As a title, it effectively piques the interest of potential viewers who are fans of psychological horror and suspense-filled drama, inviting them to delve into the horrifying world of the death cult disguised among the vast, eerie cornfields of western Nebraska."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I can still remember the day I met my best friend Judy. She had just moved into the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to meet me. I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother,scared to look at each other. Soon we lost the shyness and started playing with each other. In the 7th grade ,I first lost touch with her. She was going through family problems and I _ her to be with the cooler people. None of my new friends liked her as much as I did because they knew she had problems. However, every summer we would always sit at each other's house, watch soap operas and talk about all the boys we like. It was last year when I noticed the problem. I guess I was too doveted in high school to realizeshe needed someone there. Anyway ,she made a new best friend and so did I. Then I didn't know why, but she started cutting herself! She then was diagnosed with clinical depression .At first, I was very upset, but we still stayed in touch. I wanted to be there with new her best friend basically deserted her and people were calling her crazy. Yesterday she came to me and said,\\"I never knew what a best friend was until you, the only person, would stop me cutting. I appreciate your help so much, and you didn't even know you were helping me.\\" We both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is never to give up on your friends. Even if they aren't as cool as others, or people think they are crazy, they need someone there. If you desert them, you will only be guilty yourself. Question: Judy was diagnosed with clinical depression. The most probable cause is _ . Options: A: She was too devoted in high school B: She was too shy to solve her family problems C: She couldn't learn how to make new friends D: She went through family problems and her friends deserted her A:","completion":"The most probable cause of Judy's clinical depression, given the context of the article, is D: She went through family problems and her friends deserted her. The article outlines an intimate portrait of two friends growing up together, but it also highlights instances of miscommunication, abandonment, and societal pressures that Judy experienced. Analyzing the options, Option A indicates the cause being Judy being too devoted in high school. However, it was mentioned in the article that she was having family issues from 7th grade, which suggests that her struggles had an earlier onset than just her high school experience. Option B suggests that Judy was too shy to solve her family problems. Whilst this option might partially address the root cause to the issue, the article did not fully stress on her shyness as a contributing factor to her depression. It's also important to note that it's highly likable that dealing with family problems is beyond the control of young teenagers, shy or not. Option C states that she couldn't learn how to make new friends. However, the text recounts that even after losing touch in the 7th grade, they made new respective friends which invalidates this option. Option D, on the other hand, encapsulates the significant hardships Judy underwent. The article explicitly states her struggle with family problems and being deserted by her friends. It's important to note that losing close connections like family and friends could potentially trigger feelings of loneliness and rejection, which may play a significant role in sparking or worsening depressive symptoms. Hence, given the available context, option D seems to be the most plausible cause of her clinical depression. It's crucial to remember that several factors could lead to mental health disorders like depression, including biological, psychological, and environmental aspects. It is not just one reason that could lead to depression, it usually a mix of multiple interlinked reasons. But within the provided context, her family problems and subsequent isolation seem to be the prevailing issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It was the second major Albanian victory over the Ottoman Empire. Sentence: Skanderbeg died in 1444.","completion":"Step 1: Identify the sentence to evaluate for truth. The sentence to evaluate is: \\"Skanderbeg died in 1444.\\" Step 2: Find relevant information in the text. The text does not provide any direct information about Skanderbeg's death. Step 3: Analyze the context to gather any indirect evidence. The text states that \\"The Battle of Mokra took place on October 10, 1445...The Albanian forces under Skanderbeg defeated the Ottoman forces under Firuz Pasha.\\" This indicates that Skanderbeg was alive and leading the Albanian forces during this battle in 1445. Step 4: Evaluate the sentence based on the gathered evidence. Since Skanderbeg was alive and leading the Albanian forces in 1445, the statement \\"Skanderbeg died in 1444\\" cannot be true.

He said a letter from the boss of Serco to David Cameron suggested \\"collusion\\" between business and Downing Street. The letter mentioned how support for EU membership could be \\"mobilised\\" - and also discussed further privatisation of the prison estate. Mr Cameron, meanwhile, has suggested the head of so-called Islamic State may be pleased with a vote to Leave. Speaking in London, the prime minister said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of so-called Islamic State in Iraq, \\"might be happy\\" in the event of a Leave vote in June, remarks which Mr Johnson said were a \\"bit too much\\". In other EU developments ahead of the 23 June referendum: Vote Leave has seized upon a leaked letter, published in the Daily Mail, from Rupert Soames - the head of the outsourcing firm Serco - to the prime minister on 8 February, in which he refers to a meeting with Mr Cameron the week before. Mr Soames, whose brother is the pro-EU Tory MP Nicholas Soames, wrote he was working with Lord Rose - chair of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign group - and Lord Chadlington, a long-term ally of Mr Cameron's - with a view to contacting some of the UK's largest firms to persuade them to highlight the perceived risks of leaving the EU in annual reports released before the 23 June poll. \\"Thank you for a very useful meeting last week,\\" he wrote. \\"There were two points I thought I might follow up on. \\"The first is how to mobilise corporates to look carefully at the risks Brexit represents... All public companies are required to set out in their Annual Report an analysis of key risks. During the Scottish referendum campaign, we managed to garner a lot of publicity as a series of companies formally stated in their annual reports that independence for Scotland was a major risk.\\" In his letter, Mr Soames also raised the issues of prison reform and the case for greater private sector involvement in the running of prisons. Serco currently operates six adult prisons in the UK and one juvenile training centre. The letter was written on the same day Mr Cameron made a speech promising the \\"biggest shake-up of prisons since the Victorian era\\", including piloting six \\"reform prisons\\" to tackle high levels of violence and re-offending. Vote Leave said the letter showed Downing Street \\"had been doing deals with businesses to exaggerate the risk of a vote to leave the EU\\". Mr Johnson, the former mayor of London who is now a leading Tory Leave campaigner, said it showed the PM's efforts to renegotiate the EU's membership had been the \\"biggest stitch-up since the Bayeux Tapestry\\". \\"Everybody is allowed to make their point but it is important that we look at what is really going on,\\" he said on a trip to Stafford. \\"When you have what looks like collusion between Downing Street and big Remain-supporting businesses. On the surface, it seems to be suggesting that in exchange for support to remain, there is consideration to be given to the exchanging of lavish public sector contracts. \\"I think we need to a full explanation of what is going on without delay.\\" Britain Stronger in Europe said Mr Johnson was \\"shouting out conspiracy theories\\" when he had been a strong supporter of Serco while he was in charge of London. It accused him of \\"stunning hypocrisy\\" over outsourcing and other EU-related issues. Both No 10 and Serco said they would not comment on the details of a leaked letter. The company, which had a turnover of Â£3.5bn last year and more than Â£100m in contracts with EU institutions, has said before that leaving the EU would be a risk to its business. Speaking to business leaders in London, Mr Cameron said they should \\"feel free\\" to speak out on either side of the argument and not be cowed by the politicised nature of the debate. \\"The British public deserve to hear from business, large and small, about what they think,\\" he said. \\"I don't want anyone to wake up on 24 June and feel they were not given the facts and the figures.\\" The Leave campaign, he suggested, was \\"losing the argument\\" and there was a \\"clear consensus\\" that quitting the EU would be damaging for both the economy and security. Meanwhile, the CBI has mobilised dozens of businesses to write to employees explaining why they want to remain ahead of the 23 June poll. Carolyn Fairbairn, the organisation's director general, said the move was \\"not about telling people how to vote\\" but rather an effort by \\"responsible business leaders\\" to explain to staff the effect Brexit would have on their companies and their livelihoods. Former British Chambers of Commerce boss John Longworth said the CBI's involvement was an \\"anti democratic abuse of power\\" from an organisation which \\"supported the ERM and the single currency\\".

The current action: they are still under the same roof while they work out the details. The hypothesis states: A. The current action: They are under the same roof while working out the details. B.

What is the sentiment of this tweet?","completion":"To determine the sentiment of this tweet, we'll break it down into parts and analyze the emotions expressed in each part. 1) \\"Adivino que tendre que dormir.\\" (I guess I'll have to sleep.) - This sentence indicates mild reluctance or acceptance of the need to sleep. 2) \\"I need some rest.\\" - This statement suggests that the user is tired or exhausted and acknowledges their need for rest. 3) \\"Goodnight!\\" - A positive and friendly farewell typically used before going to bed. 4) \\"Goodmorning too.\\" - A positive and friendly greeting typically used upon waking up or starting the day. With these pieces in mind, the overall sentiment of this tweet seems to be a mix of emotions: - Mild reluctance/acceptance (due to the need for sleep) - Tiredness/exhaustion (from needing rest) - Positivity/friendliness (from the goodnight and good morning wishes) Putting it all together, I would consider this tweet to have a generally neutral sentiment leaning slightly towards positivity, primarily due to the friendly farewells and greeting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The paragraph offers information on the cast, crew, and release date of the film but does not provide any specific details about the audience turnout, particularly on Thanksgiving. To ascertain the accuracy of the claim that moviegoers flocked to the theaters on Thanksgiving to watch A Merry Friggin' Christmas, one would need access to more data regarding the box office performance of the movie, specifically on Thanksgiving day and its surrounding time frame. Factors such as marketing efforts, movie reviews, and competing film releases could also play an essential role in gauging audience turnout. Furthermore, Thanksgiving occurs on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States, making it consistently later than the November 7th release date of the film. While it is possible that people might watch the movie on Thanksgiving after its initial release earlier in the month, there is still no data provided to support the hypothesis.

We can determine this by analyzing various aspects of the review, such as the choice of words, the expression of the reviewer's emotions, and the overall opinion conveyed about the movie. 1. Word choices: The reviewer uses words like \\"stupid,\\" \\"poorly crafted,\\" \\"disappointed,\\" and \\"terrible\\" to describe their opinion of the movie. These words possess a negative connotation and indicate dissatisfaction with the product. 2. Expressions of emotions: The reviewer shares their feelings of disappointment, particularly in expressing how both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig did not \\"get it\\" and prevent the movie from being aired. This sentiment demonstrates the reviewer's dissatisfaction not only with the movie but also with the actors' involvement. 3. Overall opinion: The reviewer states that they \\"will NOT trust their names as evidence it MUST be good.\\" This comment reflects a lack of confidence in the actors' future work based on their experience with this movie, further reinforcing the negative tone. Additionally, the use of capitalization for emphasis indicates a strong negative opinion. 4. Title of the review: The title, \\"Cowboys and Idiots,\\" itself has a negative connotation.

Statue of Liberty from World Trade Center In July 1986 I was honored to be a part of a group of photographers from the Los Angeles Times to report on the Liberty Weekend festivities in New York City. To refresh your memory, Liberty Weekend was a huge outdoor party for the people of New York to reopen and rededicate the Statue of Liberty and celebrate its centenary. Photographers from our group were positioned all over New York. Iris Schneider was across the Hudson River in New Jersey, Gary Friedman was on Governors Island, Bob Greiser and Bob Chamberlin were roaming the streets throughout the city and I was assigned to be atop the World Trade Center. Our photo editors had no idea how acrophobic – fearful of heights – I am. So trying to be a good team member, I faced my fears with a candy bar and made the daily trek to this very tall, 110-story building. For nearly a week I toted several cases containing 300 and 600 mm telephoto lenses, several camera bags, two tripods, clamps and a monopod through the subways and into the tower basement. In the basement there were great little deli stands selling sandwiches and bagels, amid an amazing little underground city with shops. I was in awe of this place. Once inside the building, I had to use three sets of very fast elevators to get to the rooftop. Each day I walked past the busy offices filled with people. The views were spectacular and this building felt powerful. Once I made it to the rooftop, I took a deep breath, commanded my knees to stop knocking and carved out a little spot against a very sizable railing with a view across the Hudson that seemed to go on forever. The Statue of Liberty looked very small from my vantage point. For several days I made my trek to the rooftop of the tallest building in New York. A pile of candy bars couldn’t make my acrophobia go away. One day while I was arriving with my gear, I was gripped with fear and anger when I saw several New York cops standing on the ledge of the building while they laughed and took pictures of each other — yikes! One false move and they were dead. Unfortunately, as soon as I got my camera out, they jumped down so I couldn’t record the moment. I was horrified, but I guess my fears started to melt a little that day. On the evening of July 3, 1986, President Reagan pushed the ceremonial button to reopen and reilluminate the Statue of Liberty, followed by a very long and illustrious fireworks show. We were still shooting film in those days and had to use some very long shutter speeds to capture the bursts, and to expose for the ships in the harbor. I didn’t notice it at the time, but the very tall tower was swaying in the breeze a little. All of my cameras and telephoto lenses were either locked down with tripods or clamped to the railings. I used a cable release, and there was movement in many of the frames. Very spooky. The next day, July 4, tall ships, warships and private sailing vessels from all over the world cruised past the Statue Of Liberty during Operation Sail. By now, most of my fears had gone away and a series of memorable moments filled that void. The beautiful sights on the Hudson River and the harbor below me were captivating and historic. On my final evening, I paused for a few minutes in a quiet place near the subway to study the map, just to make sure I was getting on the correct train, when a familiar voice broke the silence. Maybe I was in a state of delirium from lack of sleep and hard work, or maybe it was all the candy bars and coffee, but a voice that sounded like Kermit the Frog asked, “Pardon me sir, do you know which train will take me uptown … [to a certain street] ?” I turned around to see who this person was – who went with the very Muppet-sounding voice – and it was Jim Henson himself. I stumbled for a moment and told him I was sorry. “I come from Los Angeles, and I have no idea.… I’m trying to get back to my hotel,” I said. With that, Henson said goodbye and disappeared into a group of people. Photojournalists live vicariously. We step in and out of people’s lives and capture moments in time, saving them on film and in digital formats. For a week in 1986, I walked past the desks and offices filled with countless men and women working in the World Trade Center towers. I bought food in the basement shops. I stood on the rooftop and witnessed the beauty of a celebration. I watched, witnessed and never thought for a moment how fate would play its hand 15 years later. Recently I scanned and saved a series of pictures from the negatives and slides from Statue of Liberty Weekend that I had stored and saved in a three-ring binder. The fears that I overcame on that rooftop were renewed, but the beauty of the Statue of Liberty and the values it stands for are still strong. My long days and nights working on the rooftop of the World Trade Center have become another very strange but amazing memory to file away with so many others.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Anderson missed the 241-run first-Test win with a calf strain but is likely to replace Chris Woakes for the match at Newlands, which begins on Saturday. \\"My thought is you'd probably go with him, so fingers crossed he comes to us and says his body's feeling good,\\" said England coach Trevor Bayliss. South Africa pace bowler Dale Steyn misses out with a shoulder injury. Steyn, ranked as the number one Test bowler in the world, twice left the field during the first Test in Durban and will be replaced by Kagiso Rabada. Another Proteas pace bowler, Kyle Abbott, faces a fitness test on Friday, while wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock could be included to allow AB de Villiers to concentrate solely on batting. Anderson worked hard in the nets during the Durban Test, building up to a full six-over spell in the middle on Wednesday morning. The 33-year-old, England's leading Test wicket-taker, has 18 victims in five Tests in two previous tours of South Africa. Without him, England were still able to bowl South Africa out for 214 and 174 in the first Test in Durban, with Moeen Ali taking six wickets in the match, Steven Finn six and Stuart Broad five. Broad took the first over in both innings in Durban and former England spinner Graeme Swann has backed the Nottinghamshire seamer to lead the attack even when Anderson returns. \\"Jimmy's performance would not be affected by not being the official leader of the attack,\\" Swann told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"I'd say we are going to hand that to Stuart now because we are looking for leaders and future captains in this team. \\"Stuart Broad is a good option for that. Jimmy is world class and we can wrap him in cotton wool from now on, not play him in every Test match, not in everything. \\"It may sound ridiculous that our highest wicket-taker ever is stripped of a role, but this is just to pump up Stuart's tyres. Jimmy is still the best bowler.\\" Bayliss has welcomed the impact made by Nick Compton, who made 85 and 49 at Durban in his first Test since May 2013. There were suggestions that the 32-year-old Middlesex batsman's intense nature was the reason he was dropped after only nine Test appearances, even though he scored two centuries in that time. \\"I'm not going to judge anyone on what went before,\\" Bayliss said. \\"Everyone is allowed to get better and so far around the squad Nick has been fantastic, fitted in really well with the squad, and obviously batted very well. \\"What Nick has proven at the moment is that, of the guys around, he's in our best top three. \\"In Test cricket there is a role for someone who is able to get through those tough periods and make hundreds. We'd take that with our team at the moment, a lot of guys that play shots in the middle order. \\"If those guys can bat around Cook and Compton that could be the way ahead for us.\\" South Africa are without a win in their last seven Tests, which equals their longest sequence without a victory since their re-admission to international cricket in 1991. De Kock, who averages 33 from his six Tests, the last of which was in July, could return to keep wicket having made a hundred in the recent round of domestic four-day matches to follow a half-century against England for South Africa A. De Villiers dropped two catches behind the stumps during England's second innings of the first Test and there have been concerns over the star batsman's workload. Skipper Hashim Amla has made only 94 runs in his last eight Test innings but has stated his desire to remain as captain. \\"I've enjoyed every minute of it and it's just been disappointing not to get the runs,\\" he said. \\"In the middle of a Test series like this there is more hunger to get runs on the board.\\" South Africa (from): H Amla (c), Q De Kock (wkt), AB De Villiers (wkt), K Abbott, T Bavuma, JP Duminy, F Du Plessis, D Elgar, M Morkel, C Morris, D Piedt, Rabada, R Rossouw, S Van Zyl, H Viljoen.

Umpires: A Dar (Pak), B Oxenford (Aus) Third umpire: R Tucker (Aus) Match referee: R Madugalle (Sri Lanka) Summary:","completion":"Here's a little simpler version of the story: Anderson didn't play in the first game because his calf muscle was hurting, but now he feels better and he'll probably replace Chris Woakes in the next game, which will start on Saturday. The coach of England's team, Trevor Bayliss, seems quite hopeful about it. A player from South Africa's team, Dale Steyn, won't play because he hurt his shoulder. He's really good at the game, but he'll be replaced by Kagiso Rabada. Another player from South Africa's team, Kyle Abbott, will have a test on Friday to see if he's fit enough to play, and Quinton de Kock might also get to play, which means AB de Villiers will only have to bat. Even without Anderson, England's team was able to win against South Africa by getting all their players out twice in the first game, with Moeen Ali, Steven Finn and Stuart Broad playing well. Even when Anderson comes back, people say Stuart Broad should still be the one to lead the team. Nick Compton, who scored a lot of runs in the first game, is being praised by the coach. Compton hasn't played a game since May 2013, but even then, he did really well. South Africa hasn't won a game in their last seven games, which is a big deal since they're usually a really good team. De Kock might get to play as a wicketkeeper (the one who catches the ball behind the batsman) because he's good at the game and they think AB de Villiers has too much work to do. Their captain, Hashim Amla, hasn't scored a lot recently, but he wants to keep being the captain. That's pretty much it!

Present-day Powder River County was probably first entered by Europeans in the early 1800s in the form of French fur trappers. In the summer of 1865, the United States government sent over 2,000 U.S. soldiers into the Powder River country to combat Native Americans from the Cheyenne people, Lakota people, and Arapaho people tribes. From September 1-15, 1865, the Powder River Expedition (1865) battled Native Americans in the Powder River Battles (1865) near the future site of Broadus. On March 17, 1876, the Battle of Powder River occurred in the south-central part of the county, about southwest of Broadus. In June 1876 six companies of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (United States) led by Major Marcus Reno marched along the Powder River nearly to the mouth of the Little Powder before turning west toward the Battle of Little Bighorn. On November 1, 1878, Powderville, Montana became the first establishment in the county, as the Powder River Telegraph Station, on the Fort Keogh to Deadwood, South Dakota telegraph line. On April 5, 1879, the Mizpah Creek Incidents began near the Powderville telegraph station in the extreme northern part of the county. In the early 1880s, a large area of Southeastern Montana became Custer County, Montana, including the present area encompassed by Powder River County. In February 1900, the Broadus post office was established, named after the Broaddus family. In October 1918, publication of a newspaper, the Broadus Independent (now called the Powder River Examiner), began in Broadus, and is still published today. In 1919, Powder River County, Montana was formed from southern Custer County, and in an election in 1920, Broadus was chosen as the county seat of the newly established Powder River County.

Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure and Summer Wars were both animated films created in 2009; however, which one had a main character that originated from a play by J.M. Barrie?","completion":"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is the animated film that features a main character originating from a play by J.M. Barrie. It is a direct-to-video movie that is part of Disney's Tinker Bell film series, based on Disney's adaptation of the character Tinker Bell from J.M. Barrie's 1904 play, \\"Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up,\\" and its 1911 novelization, \\"Peter and Wendy.\\" The character Tinker Bell originated from these works by Barrie, where she played a pivotal role as a fairy companion of Peter Pan in the fictional realm of Neverland. This animated film, released in 2009, was a sequel to Disney's 2008 movie \\"Tinker Bell,\\" and followed Tinker Bell's journey as she embarked on a grand quest to find a lost treasure. The narrative took Tinker Bell on an adventure filled with friendship, discovery, and self-realization through her interactions with new characters and selfless acts for the benefit of her world, known as Pixie Hollow. Tinker Bell, being the main character of the film, originated from the works of J.M. Barrie, and has since then become a recognizable and well-loved fictional icon in her own right, separate from her connection to Peter Pan. On the other hand, Summer Wars is a 2009 Japanese animated science fiction film, directed by Mamoru Hosoda and produced by Madhouse, which has no connection to J.M. Barrie's works or Tinker Bell. The story revolves around a young mathematician, Kenji Koiso, who becomes involved in a complex virtual world called OZ, where users from around the globe interact with each other and engage in various activities. As a rogue artificial intelligence threatens to wreak havoc, Kenji and other characters must work together to prevent catastrophe both in the digital world and real-life consequences. In conclusion, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is the 2009 animated film that showcases a main character, Tinker Bell, that originated from a play by J.M. Barrie. It is inspired by Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" and the world he created with Neverland and its inhabitants. Meanwhile, Summer Wars is an original Japanese animated movie that has no connection to the works of J.M. Barrie or the characters he created."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: How anonymous is the Anonymous hacker group? The Anonymous hacker group is a loosely affiliated and decentralized international network of \\"hacktivists\\" who perform cyberattacks on various government, corporate, and individual targets. Due to its organization structure and how participants operate within it, the group is somewhat anonymous. However, the degree of anonymity varies depending on several factors: 1. Modes of communication: Anonymous participants often use secure and encrypted communication channels, such as encrypted email services, virtual private networks (VPNs), proxy servers, or the Tor Network. These methods make it more difficult for law enforcement and other entities to track them. 2. Operational security (OPSEC): The anonymity of the hacker group is directly linked to the level of operational security employed by its participants. Those that practice good OPSEC, like using pseudonyms, avoiding sharing personal information, and using secure operating systems like Tails, are more likely to remain anonymous. 3. Skill level of participants: Some participants in Anonymous are highly skilled in computer security, cryptography, and other techniques that help maintain anonymity online. Those with less knowledge in these areas may be more susceptible to being identified. 4. Law enforcement and counterintelligence efforts: Even though Anonymous is somewhat anonymous, participants are not immune to being caught. Many instances have occurred where individuals associated with Anonymous have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted. Second question: How is Anonymous (Hacker Group) so successful? Anonymous' success can be attributed to a combination of factors: 1. Decentralized nature: The group is a loosely connected network without any known official leadership, which makes it difficult for authorities to pinpoint any specific individual or core group responsible for their actions. This decentralized structure also allows for operational flexibility. 2. Collective power: Because Anonymous attracts people from different parts of the world with diverse skills and expertise, the group can tackle a wide range of targets with varying degrees of difficulty. Their collective efforts increase efficiency and effectiveness. 3. Grassroots activism: Anonymous is often motivated by a sense of activism, fighting against perceived injustice, or espousing certain political or social ideologies. This resonates with a wide audience and encourages more people to participate or support their efforts. 4. High-profile targets: The group has successfully targeted high-profile organizations and individuals, such as governments, corporations, and churches, which further amplifies their message and increases public awareness of their actions. 5. Media attention: Anonymous often uses striking visuals, such as the Guy Fawkes mask, and melodramatic language to grab public attention and increase its visibility. This media attention can contribute to the group's success and inspire supporters. To answer your last question, no, these two questions are not asking the same thing. While both questions deal with the Anonymous hacker group, they address different aspects. The first question focuses on the degree of anonymity that its members can achieve, while the second question explores the reasons behind the group's success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lyra then warns her uncle, Lord Asriel, who instructs her to remain in hiding. Lyra watches Asriel give a presentation regarding Dust, a particle that the Magisterium has forbidden the mention of. The college gives Asriel a grant to fund a northern expedition. At dinner, Lyra meets Mrs. Coulter, who insists on taking Lyra north as her assistant. Before Lyra leaves, the Master of the college entrusts her with the only remaining alethiometer, a compass-like artifact that reveals the truth. The Magisterium has destroyed all the others. He instructs her to keep it secret, especially from Mrs. Coulter. At Mrs. Coulter's house in a city that resembles a futuristic London, Lyra mentions 'dust', a type of mysterious particle. This puts Mrs. Coulter on edge and she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she leave the bag containing the aleithiometer. Mrs. Coulter's dÃ¦mon (a golden monkey) attacks Pan, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pan discover that Mrs. Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, the \\"Gobblers\\", who have been kidnapping local children. She also discovers that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been taken by the Gobblers. Lyra and Pan walk in on Mrs. Coulter's dÃ¦mon attempting to steal the alethiometer. They escape into the streets. The \\"Gobblers\\" pursue her, but she is saved by some Gyptians.

Available options: -- yes; -- it is not possible to tell; -- no;","completion":"Based on the premise \\"I feel like a fool,\\" it can be deduced that the person is indeed experiencing a sense of foolishness at the time of the statement. This is because the premise directly refers to the individual's present emotional state, and the language used, \\"feel like,\\" implies a current experience. Thus, when considering the hypothesis \\"I am feeling foolish right now,\\" it can be said that the premise does indeed entail it.

However, it is crucial to distinguish between them and to recognize the subtle differences between the words and phrases used. The presence of the word \\"fool\\" in the premise indicates a sense of embarrassment, regret, or frustration about the past or current situation. On the other hand, the word \\"foolish\\" in the hypothesis focuses on the feeling of being unwise but does not necessarily carry the same weight of embarrassment or regret.

A teaching assistant has escaped jail after sending lewd texts and naked photos of herself to a 14-year-old pupil. Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to the male student at a school where she worked in Telford, Shropshire, a court heard. She also sent him a series of naked photos - including an image of herself using a sex toy. Spared jail: Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to a teenage pupil, Shrewsbury Crown Court (pictured) heard. She has been handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. The mother of two admitted one charge of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity at Shrewsbury Crown Court on Friday. However, she has now been spared jail after a judge handed her a 20-month sentence, suspended for two years. Trinder began sending Facebook messages to children at the school in 2011, before singling out the teenage boy, the court heard. Contact: Trinder sent the student lewd texts every day, saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him (file picture) She then gave the pupil her Blackberry pin number and sent him a topless photo of herself - with only her arms covering her breasts. She later messaged the boy a nude image of the lower half of her body, before sending him a photo of herself using a sex toy. Trinder also sent the student lewd texts every day - saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him, the court heard. Raj Punia, prosecuting, said the school had spoken to Trinder about her behaviour in July 2011 after discovering she was chatting to pupils on Facebook. 'She was warned she would be putting her job at risk if she continued,' she said. 'In November it was brought to the attention of the authorities that there were inappropriate activities going on. 'She gave him (teenage boy) the pin number for her Blackberry phone so he could text her for free. 'He. sent her a message saying \\"hi\\" and instead of ignoring the message or. telling him it was inappropriate to text her, she encouraged this. contact. 'One night in August 2011 she sent him a message saying she was out drinking and said she was \\"horny\\".' Sentencing Trinder, Judge Robin Onions described her as 'totally unsuited' to a career in teaching. 'The school appears to have acted completely properly and warned her and she just ignored the warnings,' he said. Dismissed: Telford and Wrekin Council (pictured), which employed Trinder, said she was fired in March 2012. 'He was a remarkably vulnerable pupil and she was clearly sexually attracted to him. 'In many ways this is a classic grooming case, but they did meet and didnâ€™t have sexual contact. 'If there had been any contact, she would have gone into custody and it would have been measured in years. 'This young lady is remarkably immature and totally unsuited to a career in teaching. If she does anything like this again it will be prison.' Trinder has been banned from working with children for life and placed under a sexual offences prevention order for seven years. She has also been handed a two-year supervision order with 10-year notification requirements and a three-month curfew. Speaking after the case, Nigel Newman, a spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council which employed Trinder, said the teaching assistant was fired in March last year. He said: 'The individual was suspended from her employment with the council as a support assistant in February 2012 as soon as we were made aware of the allegation arising from the incident which led to her being charged by police. 'Following this, disciplinary proceedings were held which resulted in her dismissal from her job with the council in March 2013.'

Article: Bowing is a very important custom in Japan. Unlike people in many other countries, they greet each other by bowing instead of shaking hands. It is impolite not to return a bow to whoever bows to you. Bowing has many functions in one. It expresses the feeling of respect, thanks, regret, and so on. You can bow when you say, \\"thank you\\", \\"sorry\\", \\"hello\\", \\"goodbye\\", \\"congratulations\\", \\"excuse me\\", \\"good morning\\", and more. Bowing seems simple, but there are different ways of bowing. Bowing techniques vary from a small nod of the head to a long, 90-degree bow. It depends on the social position or age of the person you bow to. If your opposite is of higher social position or older than yourself, you are supposed to bow deeper and longer than him or her. It is polite to bow from your waist. Men usually keep their hands at their sides, and women usually put their hands together on their legs with their fingers touching. If it is not a very formal situation, you can bow by nodding. The most common bow is a bow of about 15 degrees. You might feel strange doing it, but try to bow in Japan.

Options are: + Energy for cell processes is released.. + Oxygen is released for photosynthesis.. + Cells undergo decomposition.. + Nutrients are excreted to prevent the buildup of body fat..","completion":"The correct answer to the question is: Energy for cell processes is released. Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic processes that take place within the cells of living organisms, during which energy stored in organic molecules, primarily glucose, is converted into a more readily usable form, known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Cellular respiration is essential for all living organisms because it provides the energy needed to sustain their cellular functions. The process of cellular respiration mainly involves three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. 1. Glycolysis: It is the first stage of cellular respiration that takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound). This process generates two molecules of ATP (used as energy for cellular processes) and two molecules of NADH (an electron carrier molecule). 2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle or Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle): It takes place in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells or the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The two molecules of pyruvate formed during glycolysis are converted into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle. In this cycle, acetyl-CoA is completely oxidized, releasing carbon dioxide as a waste product. During the citric acid cycle, a small amount of ATP is produced, along with NADH and FADH2 (another electron carrier molecule). 3. Oxidative Phosphorylation: It is the final stage of cellular respiration and takes place in the inner membrane of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells or the plasma membrane of prokaryotic cells. This process involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen molecules through a series of protein complexes called the electron transport chain. This electron transfer process creates a gradient of protons across the membrane, which drives the synthesis of a larger number of ATP molecules through a process known as chemiosmosis. In summary, cellular respiration results in the release of energy for cell processes in the form of ATP, which can be utilized by the cell to carry out various functions such as growth, maintenance, and reproduction. The byproducts of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide and water, which are excreted from the organism as waste products. Oxygen is not released during cellular respiration. Instead, it is consumed as the final electron acceptor during the process of oxidative phosphorylation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that was evacuated from Leningrad? ? The Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 took place on 9 August 1942 during the Second World War, while the city of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) was under siege by Nazi German forces. Dmitri Shostakovich had intended the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, but because of the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert. Despite the poor condition of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert was supported by a Soviet military offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence German forces during the performance. The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of psychological warfare. The Leningrad première was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and political effects. The conductor concluded that \\"in that moment, we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine\\". Reunion concerts featuring surviving musicians were convened in 1964 and 1992 to commemorate the event.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on.

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Monteux"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If you have an underlying medical issue or a blood disease that prevents your body from producing red blood cells, you won't be able to avoid anemia on your own. Seeking medical help to understand and treat the disease is the best way forward. Anemia that is not preventable can be congenital or caused by a number of conditions including: chronic disease, bone marrow disease, sickle cell and aplastic anemia, and thalassemia. Some diseases prevent the body from making the correct number of red blood cells. The most common of these is kidney disease. If you have a disease that makes you prone to anemia, consulting your physician for appropriate treatment is absolutely necessary. If you have anemia from an intestinal condition such as Crohn’s or Celiac, you will need to speak to your doctor and develop an effective treatment plan. If you have aplastic anemia or anemia caused by cancer, you may need a bone marrow transplant to help your body produce more red blood cells. If you have hemolytic anemia, you may need to avoid certain medications and take immunosuppressant drugs to boost your red blood cell count. Eating a lot of iron and avoiding situations that may cause injury could also help. In some cases, anemia is inherited in the form of a blood disease. Knowing that you or family members have the disease is the important first step to getting proper treatment and managing the condition. The following blood diseases cause anemia: People suffering from sickle cell anemia have red blood cells shaped like sickles, which makes the cells prone to getting stuck in blood vessels and blocking blood flow. Sickle cell anemia can be very serious and very painful if not treated. Thalassemia causes the body to make less hemoglobin than normal, leading to anemia. Aplastic anemia causes the body to stop making enough new blood cells, including red blood cells. This can be caused by outside factors like certain cancer treatments, exposure to toxic chemicals, drugs, infections, and other causes.

In the case of this article, the summary is that some types of anemia cannot be prevented or treated just by eating healthy food. These types of anemia can be caused by different medical problems, like blood diseases or kidney disease. People with these problems need to talk to their doctors to find the best way to help their bodies make enough red blood cells.

Context: Before we got married my husband and I lived in 4 different apartments all within the span of one year. The worst one of all of them was actually a great apartment, but our upstairs neighbors drove us positively insane. A list of their common antics: Blasting movies/music with the bass turned all the way up into the small hours of the morning, in their bedroom, which was directly above our bedroom Stomping, all day, every day, no matter what, always stomping. Sometimes running full speed around their apartment. It was a 1 bedroom and they had at least 4 adults (two couples) and at least 2 kids living there. They also always had company over. It was a nonsmoking complex but they smoked on their porch and tossed their butts over their balcony, which would leave them landing in our little porch. Constantly came out to find butts and trash in our potted plants and all over the ground. We had to call the sheriff on them once because one of the couples living there got in a very loud, very obvious domestic violence situation. We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall. The kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too. Could have started a fire. Then there was the spitting. They would spit over the edge of their balcony and we complained so they started spitting THROUGH the floor boards so it was definitely intentional. I have never experienced a more trashy group of people. So glad to be out of that apartment and away from them now. Question: How does the writer feel about the stability of the family living above?

The sentence clearly identifies who were taking slaves as concubines during the time period specified. It mentions three groups of people: white slaveholders, their sons, and other powerful white men. These people engaged in the practice of taking slave women as concubines in spite of anti-miscegenation laws, which were designed to prevent this. In the context of this sentence, \\"concubines\\" refers to enslaved women who were used for sexual purposes by their white masters. These relationships were often non-consensual and exploitative, as the enslaved women had no agency or control over their own bodies and could not refuse their masters' advances. Anti-miscegenation laws were legislated in many states during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries to maintain racial separation and reinforce white supremacy. These laws prohibited intermarriage and sexual relations between people of different races. However, the existence of these laws did not deter white slaveholders, their sons, or other powerful white men from engaging in sexual relationships with enslaved women of African descent and fathering multiracial children.

Article:The contracts mean maximum flexibility for the employer and minimum security for the worker - the sense of David being, well, thoroughly crushed by Goliath - undervalued, underpaid and thrown to the wolves when it suits. It's all pretty fertile territory for the man who's built his economic case around the \\"cost-of-living crisis\\". Labour leader Ed Miliband has bemoaned zero-hours contracts in the past - but Newsnight has learned that on Friday he'll attempt to turn words into policy. Speaking in Scotland - in what's being billed as his first attempt to make his mark on the pro-Union side of the independence debate - he'll offer legislation under a Labour government to stop what he's called an exploitative practice. He will promise some key measures: Mr Miliband will say the key to these policies is that they are UK-wide (a nod, then, to No to Scottish independence), to ensure that the economies both sides of the border don't try to undercut each other in a race to the bottom. So far so good. It'll chime with a lot of people pulling pints, stacking shelves, building houses and so on. But it doesn't take a genius to spot where such a plan might unravel. Who's to stop a boss, for example, offering five months' work instead of six to get around the legislation. Who's to stop a boss firing a worker just short of a year in, if they suddenly fear a little bit too much commitment coming round the corner? Critics also point out that the realities of life for those who work under zero-hours contracts mean few may be willing to stand their ground and fight for their rights. They often apply to the vulnerable - young workers, first-timers - those generally less likely to flex their muscle against all-powerful boss. Mr Miliband may be the first to put a legislative pledge in writing - but he's certainly not the first to raise the zero-hours contracts issue. Last week UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the Express he wanted to \\"tackle\\" the practice, saying: \\"I do not believe in banning zero-hours contracts. But I do believe there is a very strong case for expecting large employers to sign up to a tough code of conduct as to how they are applied. \\"For instance, if an employee proves reliable enough to be working for a big company for a year or more then there should be an expectation that the company will offer him or her a permanent position.\\" And this is where the politics gets interesting. Mr Miliband and Mr Farage may be seeking the same kind of voter - badly paid, disenfranchised, frustrated with the perceived big, bad corporate world. What the other two main parties do in response will be key. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has already ruled out a complete ban on the contracts and the Conservatives are unlikely to want to take employers on with this one either. But payday loans and energy prices - both of which the coalition has acted upon - began as \\"Labour issues\\". Mr Miliband's ideas on zero-hours contracts may start by being rubbished and ridiculed. Yet could they also end up influencing his opponents? See my full report on Newsnight on BBC Two from 22:30 BST on Thursday and on the BBC iPlayer later. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article highlights the issue of zero-hours contracts, which provide maximum flexibility for employers and minimum security for workers, leading to feelings of being undervalued and underpaid. Labour leader Ed Miliband plans to turn his opposition to zero-hours contracts into policy, offering legislation under a Labour government to stop what he calls an exploitative practice. He proposes several key measures, including restrictions on the use of zero-hours contracts and guaranteeing certain rights to employees who have been working under such contracts for an extended period of time. These policies are intended to be UK-wide, addressing both sides of the Scottish independence debate. Critics argue that implementation of these policies may be difficult, as employers can find ways around the legislation, and workers on zero-hours contracts, who are often young and vulnerable, may not be willing to stand their ground and fight for their rights. The article also mentions UKIP leader Nigel Farage's proposal of a tough code of conduct for large employers using zero-hours contracts, which he believes should not be banned but regulated. The response of the two main parties, the Lib Dems and the Conservatives, will be crucial as they have ruled out a complete ban on zero-hours contracts but have acted on other issues brought up by Labour, such as payday loans and energy prices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mount Dana , elevation , was climbed the next day by the group before Martinez had to return home to Muir .","completion":"To accomplish this task, we will break down each sentence into its main components and compare them for both meaning and order. Let's go through the process: Sentence a): -Mount Dana: Subject of the sentence. -altitude: Not given any explicit value but suggests the high location. -climbed by the group: The action taken by a specific group. -the next day: The time when the action took place. -before Muir had to return to Martinez: An extra action/event occurring after the initial action. Sentence b): - Mount Dana: Subject of the sentence. - elevation: Similar to 'altitude' in sentence (a), suggesting the high location. - climbed the next day by the group: The action, similar to sentence (a), but in a different order. Instead of saying \\"was climbed by the group\\", it's \\"climbed...by the group\\". - before Martinez had to return home to Muir: This indicates an event happening after the main action. Here's where the change in meaning occurs: In Sentence A, Muir is the one returning to Martinez, while in Sentence B, Martinez is returning to Muir. Both sentences talk about a group climbing Mount Dana on the next day, but differ in 'who' has to return 'where'. So, to conclude, these two sentences do not have the same meaning because of the difference in who is returning and where they're returning to."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
