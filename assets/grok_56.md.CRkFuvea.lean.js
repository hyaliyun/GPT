Title: Books at a great price Review: The price is great - not sure what is up with the funky cover or how it relates to the book title - but it was in excellent condition and shipped fast. A:","completion":"Based on the customer's review, it can be inferred that the customer is generally satisfied with their purchase. The reasons for their satisfaction are as follows: 1. Great price: The customer specifically mentions that the price of the book is \\"great.\\" Price is often a crucial factor when it comes to purchasing items, and if the customer believes the price is favorable, it can contribute positively to their overall experience, thus leading to satisfaction. 2. Excellent condition: The fact that the customer received the book in \\"excellent condition\\" furthers their satisfaction level. The customer would be happy knowing that they got a high-quality product at a great price, ultimately serving their purpose and expectations. 3. Fast shipping: The customer also positively notes the shipping process. They mention that the book was \\"shipped fast,\\" which reflects the customer's appreciation for the timely delivery of their product.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop? from the following article ? The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455 Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory.

Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color.

It could be any one of these four finalists By Gary Strauss, USA TODAY After thousands of auditions and weeks of performances, NBC's America's Got Talent is down to four acts competing for the Season 5 crown. Tonight (9 ET/PT), three singers and a novelty group seemingly destined for Las Vegas perform for a final time, with a winner to be crowned following Wednesday's two-hour finale (8 p.m. ET/PT). USA TODAY talks to the four finalists ahead of tonight's performances. The angelic 10-year-old with the preternaturally mature voice came late to AGT, among 12 performers selected for an August show based on YouTube video submissions. Evancho's operatic performances have wowed viewers ever since. \\"I don't know where it comes from,\\" Evancho says. \\"It's just a gift from God, I think.\\" Evancho discovered a singing ability after watching Phantom of the Opera as a 7-year-old in Lincoln Township, Pa. She has performed at local talent concerts and Pittsburgh Pirates games. No matter how she does tonight, Evancho — who released the album Prelude to a Dream in November and will perform at Carnegie Hall's Christmas Carol show in December — hopes to make singing a career. \\"I really haven't figured out a plan, but I would like to do concerts and stuff,\\" she says. For now, the fifth-grader — whose performances have pulled in nearly 20 million YouTube views — is looking forward to going home. \\"I'll be glad when this is over. There's a lot of stuff to concentrate on.\\" Part Kabuki theater, part Blue Man Group, Fighting Gravity features 13 Virginia Tech fraternity brothers who have forgone their fall semester to compete on AGT. \\"The worst part was letting down our parents,\\" says Gregg Curtin, a senior from Falls Church, Va. \\"But we all think we're learning life skills about teamwork and time management that you can't learn in school.\\" Like Jackie Evancho and Prince Poppycock, Fighting Gravity was discovered virally, after five original group members performed at a campus talent show. Their subsequent AGT performances have featured crowd-pleasing, over-the-top choreographed moves that the competition's judges say are ideal for the big Las Vegas show venues that all four final acts hope to secure. Fighting Gravity already has received an offer to play Vegas' Hard Rock Cafe on New Year's Eve. \\"We're still debating it,\\" Curtin says. \\"But we're focusing on things one day at a time.\\" The choreography and lighting — done without professional help — is all-consuming. \\"It can be incredibly draining, working 14-hour days,\\" he says. Bluesy singer Grimm didn't make it through an early round of America's Got Talent last year. He auditioned again this year to honor his grandparents, Tom and Laura Butters, who raised him but are still reeling after losing their southern Mississippi home to Hurricane Katrina. \\"I'm surprised and grateful to make it this far,\\" says Grimm, who began singing and playing guitar at local bars at age 12. He's spent the past decade working smallish restaurants and lounges in Las Vegas. His biggest pre-AGT gig? Opening for rock band Heart in 2006. \\"Nothing compares to this show,\\" says Grimm, 30, a self-described nerd whose interests include everything from stamp collecting to panning for gold with his girlfriend, Lucie. AGT is opening potential offers, including recording deals and offers to play larger venues. \\"Everything I've been working for my whole life, it's been an uphill climb. I see the summit in front of me. I'm almost there,\\" he says. If he wins, Grimm plans to buy a home for his grandparents: \\"Hopefully this will get me to the point where I can do something for them.\\" The flamboyant, over-the-top alter ego of John Quale is part performance artist, part opera singer, a persona developed for a 2006 nightclub gig. AGT producers found a Poppycock performance on the Internet and encouraged him to audition. Since widespread exposure on summer's top-rated series, the campy character has gained fans \\"from little kids to grandmothers,\\" he says. \\"The huge outpouring of love has been incredible.\\" Quale isn't talking about how he'll top last week's semifinals performance, a Liberace-fused homage to Uncle Sam. \\"Hopefully it will be a fitting finale performance for this crazy journey that Poppycock has gone on,\\" says Quale, 32. The Los Angeles store clerk, normally shy and reserved, undergoes a massive personality change as Poppycock. \\"I can be dark and withdrawn at times, but when I am Poppycock, I can make fun of myself in a way that people can join in on.\\" Post- AGT, Quale hopes to record a second album and perform stage shows. \\"Offers have started to come in, but I need to be focused on (tonight).\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Question: where does cellular respiration occur I found the following answer on Google: The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly address the question of where cellular respiration occurs. Cellular respiration is a process that occurs primarily in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. It is a series of metabolic reactions that convert nutrients, like glucose, into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency of the cell. The process can be broadly categorized into three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle), and the electron transport chain (oxidative phosphorylation). 1. Glycolysis: This process takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell and does not require oxygen. Glycolysis involves the breakdown of one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound). The process generates a net gain of two ATP molecules and two molecules of the electron carrier NADH. 2. Krebs Cycle: The Krebs cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria. Each pyruvate molecule produced during glycolysis is converted into an acetyl-CoA molecule, which then enters the Krebs cycle. The cycle consists of a series of redox reactions that produce energy-rich molecules like NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). These molecules are used in the next stage of cellular respiration to generate more ATP. The Krebs cycle also releases two molecules of ATP along with carbon dioxide as a waste product. 3. Electron Transport Chain (Oxidative Phosphorylation): The final stage of cellular respiration takes place in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The electron carriers NADH and FADH2 generated in the previous stages donate their electrons to the electron transport chain, which powers the synthesis of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor in the chain, and water is the waste product. This stage is responsible for generating the majority of the ATP produced during cellular respiration, approximately 32-34 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose. In conclusion, cellular respiration mainly occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Individual processes like glycolysis occur in the cytoplasm of the cell, while the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain are localized within the mitochondria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They both loved to help people in their own ways. Erin was a kind-hearted girl who loved to share her smiles, hugs, and laughter with everyone she met. She believed that helping others didn't need a price tag, and so she offered her time and energy for free. Erin was like a little sunshine, brightening up everyone's day with her kindness. Jennifer, on the other hand, liked the idea of turning her helpful skills into a little business. She decided to charge for her time because she believed that people would value and appreciate her help more if they paid for it. Jennifer was a very organized girl, and she always made sure to schedule her appointments and manage her time wisely. One sunny afternoon, a little boy named Timmy needed help with his homework. He had a difficult math problem that he just couldn't figure out. Timmy knocked on Erin's door, and she welcomed him with a warm hug. \\"Of course, I'll help you, Timmy!\\" Erin said, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. Together, they sat down and tackled the math problem. Timmy couldn't believe how fast Erin helped him understand the math problem, and he thanked her with a big smile. Later that day, Timmy's older sister Sarah needed help with her science project. She was feeling the pressure because it was due the very next day. Remembering how helpful Jennifer was known to be, Sarah decided to seek her assistance. Sarah paid Jennifer for her time, and they got to work. Since Jennifer was so organized and experienced, they finished the science project quickly. Sarah was grateful for Jennifer's help, and she left feeling confident in her project. Both Timmy and Sarah learned something valuable that day. Erin taught Timmy that kindness and love could be shared freely, and he found comfort in her caring approach. Sarah, meanwhile, learned that paying for help could be worthwhile, because Jennifer's expertise saved her time and helped her achieve success for her project. Erin and Jennifer's town continued to flourish as they both shared their talents and strengths with their neighbors. The people in the town knew that they could always count on Erin's selfless love and Jennifer's resourceful skills whenever they needed a helping hand.

Article: Almost nothing we do in this world is done in isolation*. At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure. Lastly, and probably most importantly, good leaders need to be sensitive*, confident and be able to get on well with different kinds of people.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What does Beyoncé introduce by name as the song opens? ? \\"Déjà Vu\\" is a contemporary R&B song, performed in a moderate hip hop groove. It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone \\"to play something more singing\\",...

The Roman Republic (Latin: Res publica Romana; Classical Latin: [ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na]) was the period of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. During the first two centuries of its existence, the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century, it included North Africa, Spain, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to the transition from republic to empire. The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. However, most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves, the Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending the Republic. What marked the beginning of the Roman Republic?","completion":"The beginning of the Roman Republic was marked by the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Invention workshops will guide you through the basics of coming up with an idea, building it, and then telling other people about why your idea is important and useful. There are young inventor workshops all over the world that you can sign-up for and participate in. There are also camps available for young inventors that might be of interest. In most cases a simple name describing the function of your invention is sufficient, but a catchy name can also help people remember your product. Keep the name short and to-the-point. Avoid using a confusing or misleading name. Come up with a few different names and ask your friends and family what sounds the best. In order to protect your invention and claim it as your own, you must patent it. A patent is a legal document stating that you came up with the idea and proves that you own the invention. It prevents other people from stealing your idea. The patent process can be complicated so ask your parents for help with this if it’s something you are seriously considering. If you want to mass produce your invention and start selling it to others, you will likely need to raise some money. Investors are individuals who give you money when you are first starting out so you can produce the product. In return, they will get some of the profits from the sales of product. You can start by asking friends and family to help out. Participating in inventor challenges can be a great start because many of them have cash prizes. Inventor challenge competitions are a great way to show your inventions. Some of these competitions may have specific problems that they are trying to solve, while others are completely open to submit whatever you like. If you have a working prototype, consider submitting it to an open competition. Find a competition near you and register for it.

At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. What will likely happen when the teacher finishes her instructions? - the children will go outside to play - the children will draw their self portrait - not enough information - the children will trace their hands","completion":"The most likely outcome when the teacher finishes her instructions is that the children will draw their self portrait. The passage explicitly describes a lesson aimed at teaching young children how to create self portraits. The teacher models the process, explaining and visually illustrating each step for the students. The overall context and goal of the lesson, as well as the detailed description of how the teacher guides the students through the self-portrait creation process, strongly suggest that the students will attempt to draw their self portraits after the teacher finishes her instructions. The presented options do not provide any contextual evidence that the children would go outside to play or trace their hands, and all needed information for the task is given, thus these options can be eliminated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which has a more importance with constraints? Context: In a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991, Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky developed optimality theory—an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially Mark Hale and Charles Reiss.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the quartet that wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal? , can you please find it? Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

In this article, we will walk you through the complete process of buying Orbeez and how to use them correctly for the best experience. Step 1: Purchasing Orbeez Orbeez comes in various vibrant colors and sizes that make them an exciting toy or decoration material. To purchase, you have two options available: buying in-store or online. Purchasing in-store allows you to see the product's real-time condition and availability. Visit a toy store, craft store, or general supermarket around your location and look for the section of kid's toys or craft materials, where Orbeez are typically available. One of the advantages of a physical store purchase is the opportunity to ask the salesperson for more details about the product in case of any questions or concerns. If you prefer the convenience of online shopping, Orbeez can be easily found on numerous e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, eBay, or specialized toy/craft stores online. To locate the product, type 'Orbeez' in the search bar and browse through the options available. Always remember to read through reviews and ratings to ensure the product's quality before purchasing. Step 2: Soaking Orbeez Once you have your package of Orbeez, the next step is to prepare them for use - this requires soaking them in water. Below is a simple guide: 1. Open the package: Carefully open the Orbeez package and spread them evenly in a large, shallow tray or bowl. 2. Fill with water: Pour enough water into the tray or bowl to completely submerge the Orbeez. Be cautious that excessively high water levels can cause spills, while insufficient water will not allow the Orbeez to grow to their full potential size. 3. Soak the Orbeez: Allow the Orbeez to soak in the water for at least 4 hours. This step is crucial because Orbeez are made of a superabsorbent polymer that absorbs the water, causing them to expand. As the Orbeez absorb water, they will start to grow, becoming round, squishy, and amazingly fun to play with. After soaking, it is essential to drain any excess water to prevent molding and prolong the lifespan of your Orbeez. In conclusion, purchasing a package of Orbeez either in-store or online and soaking them in water for at least 4 hours can equip you with these vibrant, engaging elements for your craft projects, decorations or simply as toys for kids. Enjoy the fun and creativity that comes with this simple yet fascinating product! In writing the given article, the first step involves detailing the process of purchasing Orbeez, covering both offline and online buying options. This gives our readers a comprehensive idea of where they might find the product.

Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right.

When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital.

Background: Edwin Washington Edwards (born August 7, 1927) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as the U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 7th congressional district from 1965 to 1972 and as the 50th Governor of Louisiana for four terms (1972-1980, 1984-1988 and 1992-1996), twice as many elected terms as any other Louisiana chief executive. He served a total of 16 years in office, the sixth-longest serving gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,784 days. A colorful, powerful and legendary figure in Louisiana politics, Edwards, who has been dubbed the \\"very last of the line of New Deal Southern Democrats\\", was long dogged by charges of corruption. In 2001, he was found guilty of racketeering charges and sentenced to ten years in Federal prison. Context: Though arguably minor compared to the Edwards scandals of the 1980s and 1990s, the governor was embroiled in several ethics controversies during his first two terms in office. At the time, Edwards was remarkably candid about his questionable practices. When questioned about receiving illegal campaign contributions, he replied that \\"It was illegal for them to give, but not for me to receive.\\" He also insisted he saw no problem with investing in a proposed New Orleans office building called \\"One Edwards Square\\" (it was never actually named that) while still governor, and demonstrated his gambling prowess to the press on one of his frequent gambling trips to Las Vegas. Later, Edwards' commissioner of administration Charles Roemer - father of future governor Buddy Roemer - was convicted of taking bribes and having connections with Mafia boss Carlos Marcello. Edwards managed to avoid direct implication in the Roemer case. During the governor's first term, a disaffected former Edwards bodyguard named Clyde Vidrine made several high-profile accusations of corruption, including the sale of state agency posts. The accusations were investigated by a grand jury, but the Edwards administration attacked Vidrine's credibility and the investigation stalled. Later, Vidrine published a tell-all book called Just Takin' Orders, which included salacious details of Edwards' frequent gambling trips and extramarital escapades. Vidrine was murdered in December 1986 by the husband of a woman he was guarding, who believed Vidrine was having an affair with his wife. In a 1976 scandal known as Koreagate, it came to light that Edwards and his wife Elaine had received questionable gifts in 1971, while Edwards was a U.S. representative. South Korean rice broker Tongsun Park was under investigation for trying to bribe American legislators on behalf of the South Korean government, and for making millions of dollars in commissions on American purchases of South Korean rice. Edwards admitted that Park gave Elaine an envelope containing 10,000 in cash, but insisted that the gift was given out of friendship and that there was nothing improper about it. In the course of the controversy, Edwards stated that he thought it was \\"super moralistic\\" for the U.S. government to prohibit American businessmen to accept gifts from foreign officials in the course of their business dealings. The scandal also engulfed Edwards's former congressional colleague Otto Passman of Monroe, who was later acquitted of all charges in the case. Question: were his accusations true?. Whats the answer?","completion":"So, a man named Edwin Washington Edwards was a very important person in Louisiana. He was the boss of the state, called the Governor, for a really long time. But some people thought he did bad things while being the boss. Some people said that he took money that he shouldn't have, and that his friends and helpers did some bad things too. There was a man named Clyde Vidrine who used to work with Edwards and said that Edwards did many wrong things. But it was hard to know if everything he said was true because he didn't have a lot of proof. Later, he wrote a book about all the things he knew and sadly, he was killed by someone else for different reasons. Another time, people talked about a problem called \\"Koreagate\\" where some people from another country, South Korea, tried to give presents and money to powerful people in the United States to make them do things for South Korea. Edwards and his wife got some money too, and some people said that it was wrong. But Edwards said it was just a gift from a friend and nothing bad happened because of it. So, it's hard to know if all the bad things people said about Edwards were true, but some people believed they were. In the end, Edwards had to go to a place called prison after they found out that he did some really bad things with money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: As soon as you meet, or even see, a person, you form an impression of him based on his posture, gesture and facial expressions. This is why it is important to make a good first impression on the person who will be interviewing you. Within the first 60 seconds of meeting you, the interviewer will have formed an impression about what type of person you are and what kind of employee you would become, and 55% of this will be based only on your body language. Here are some tips to make you that impression a good one. First of all, relax. Think positive thoughts and you are more likely to come across as a positive, confident person during the interview. Dress smartly, as your appearance is one of the first things an interviewer will notice you. Stand up straight, and walk in with your shoulders back and your head up. Try to avoid slowing down as you walk into the room because this suggests fear and uncertainty. Shake hands with the interviewer firmly. You should have a positive handshake and a warm smile. Open your coat or jacket as you sit down shows that you, too, are open. Posture is important. You should be sitting well back in your seat. Sit up straight and lean forward slightly, but not too much. Sitting at too much of an angel expresses discomfort and distrust. Two of the most common signals are crossing your arms and legs, so try to avoid them. Another important issue is eye contact. Looking someone in the eye shows confidence in yourself and trust in the other person. However, don't overdo it, as too much eye contact or starring will make the other person uncomfortable. Use more eye contact when listening than when talking, and when you look away, look down. Looking up at the ceiling will make you seem bored and rude.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major? Answer the above question based on the context below: Handel's music for Messiah is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God\\", apart from the solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" they are heard only in \\"Hallelujah\\" and the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \\"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\\". In \\"Glory to God\\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \\"quietly, from afar\\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance. In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \\"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\\" according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \\"an aspiration towards D major\\", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\" as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" and on numerous other...","completion":"Based on the given context, the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major is Handel's \\"Messiah.\\" This oratorio, composed by George Frideric Handel, is celebrated for its beautiful music and orchestral restraint. Throughout the piece, Handel employs various musical devices and techniques to create an integrated and cohesive work to convey its message. One critical aspect of Handel's \\"Messiah\\" is its tonal scheme that leans towards D major, which is associated with light and glory. The musicologist Anthony Hicks summarizes this tonal scheme as \\"an aspiration towards D major.\\" While the oratorio doesn't have a predominant key, it incorporates different shifts in key to reflect changes in mood. The key of D major emerges predominantly during the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages and ultimately brings the masterpiece to its triumphant conclusion. Moreover, musicologist Rudolf Steglich suggests that Handel uses the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\" as a unifying motif throughout the oratorio. The ascending fourth is most noticeably present in the first two notes of the aria \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth,\\" as well as in numerous other parts of the work. Handel's exceptional use of trumpets in \\"Messiah\\" is another significant aspect of his restraint. After they feature in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God,\\" the trumpets appear only in \\"Hallelujah,\\" the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb,\\" and as a solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound.\\" Musicologist Percy M. Young remarks that the trumpets' rarity throughout the work is what makes their interventions particularly effective. In conclusion, the work referred to here is Handel's \\"Messiah,\\" a masterful oratorio that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major. The innovative use of orchestral restraint, trumpet placement, and the tonal scheme revolving around D major all contribute to the work's enduring appeal and its unforgettable, exultant finale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Has these dangers caused and increase or decrease in child labour with drug cartels?\\"","completion":"The sentence \\"Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence.\\" presents an observation of the phenomenon in which drug cartels utilize children for their illicit activities. However, this statement does not directly address the specific question of whether these dangers have caused an increase or decrease in child labor within drug cartels. In order to provide a valid and detailed answer to the question, we must first analyze the factors that may have contributed to the increase or decrease in child labor within drug cartels and discuss any notable trends or shifts within this context. Some factors that could potentially impact the use of child labor by drug cartels include: 1. Law enforcement strategies: If governments and law enforcement agencies have recently intensified their efforts to crack down on drug cartels, these organizations may be more prone to using children, as they are less likely to be suspected by the authorities and can therefore continue their operations more discreetly. In this scenario, the increased dangers would potentially lead to an increase in child labor within drug cartels. 2. Public awareness and advocacy: If there is a growing public awareness and condemnation of child labor in drug cartels, exemplified through various campaigns, documentaries, and investigative journalism pieces, it could potentially dissuade drug cartels from recruiting children. This awareness, in turn, could lead to a decrease in child labor within drug cartels. 3. Economic incentives: In some regions characterized by poverty and lack of access to education, families may view participation in drug cartels as an opportunity for their children to earn income, which can undermine efforts to eradicate child labor. Conversely, broader efforts to alleviate poverty and improve educational opportunities might reduce the demand for child labor within these cartels. 4. Cartel expansion or contraction: The overall size, scale, and territorial control of drug cartels can also influence the use of child labor. An expanding cartel may require more personnel and therefore recruit more children, while a contracting cartel might have less need for child labor. 5. Organizational structure and culture: The organizational structure and culture of each specific cartel can play a significant role in determining the extent to which they utilize children for their operations. Some cartels might be more inclined to use child labor due to historical practices or specific leadership preferences, while others may minimize the practice based on ethical values or a commitment to community welfare. To draw a definitive conclusion on whether the dangers associated with drug cartels have caused an increase or decrease in child labor, a thorough analysis of the aforementioned factors would be required. It is also important to note that these factors may vary across different geographic regions and cartels. Moreover, reliable and comprehensive data on child labor within drug cartels may be difficult to obtain, given the illicit and secretive nature of these organizations. Still, a detailed and long answer to the question would address these variables and any available evidence to provide a more nuanced understanding of the current state of child labor in drug cartels."},{"prompt":"Question: Given this review: \\"Google play Love it\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

There was almost no air pollution at all in Switzerland, while the air in India was almost impossible to breathe it was so polluted. Which country had fewer people develop asthma? Answer:","completion":"Based on the described scenario, it would be Switzerland that likely had fewer people develop asthma. However, this conclusion involves a bit more complex understanding and explanation. Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways that transport air to and from the lungs. No definitive cause of asthma is known, but many environmental factors, such as air pollution, can exacerbate the condition. Individuals suffering from asthma have inflamed bronchial tubes, which leads to sensitivity to various stimuli such as air pollutants, dust, and smoke. Air pollution plays a considerable role in triggering asthma symptoms. Particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide are common pollutants that can provoke asthma attacks. When one is exposed to high levels of these pollutants, it can lead to breathing problems, damage to the lungs, and if severe enough, the development of asthma. Switzerland, known for its clean environment and strict regulations on air pollution, has relatively cleaner air than many parts of the world. This reduces residents' exposure to airborne pollutants that can ignite asthma. On the contrary, India is marked by relatively high air pollution levels. Industrial growth, rapid urbanization, and increasing vehicle emissions play a significant role in this. The particulate matter and other pollutants in the air in India are known to be at dangerously high levels, especially in urban areas. These conditions contribute significantly to respiratory problems including the prevalence of asthma. However, it's essential to remember that while there's a clear link between air pollution and asthma, asthma's exact cause isn't solely dependent on air quality. Factors like genetics, overall health, immune system behavior, and other environmental factors also play a significant role. Therefore, specific individual's health can vary greatly and isn't necessarily indicative of the general population's health. Yet, when considering the overall population, given the described conditions, we would expect fewer cases of asthma development in Switzerland due to lower air pollution compared to India."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Rae Armantrout, who has been a poetry professor at the University of California San Diego(UCSD) for two decades, has won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize in the poetry category for her most recent book, \\"Versed\\". \\"I'm delighted and amazed at how much media recognition that the Pulitzer brings, as compared to even the National Book Critics Award, which I was also surprised and delighted to win,\\" said Armantrout. \\"For a long time, my writing has been just below the media radar, and to have this kind of attention, suddenly, with my 10th book, is really surprising.\\" Armantrout, a native Californian, received her bachelor's degree at UC Berkeley, where she studied with noted poet Denise Levertov, and her master's in creative writing from San Francisco State University. She is a founding member of Language Poets, a group in American poetry that analyzes the way language is used and raises questions to make the reader think. In March, she won the National Book Critics Circle Award for \\"Versed.\\" \\"This book has gotten more attention,\\" Armantrout said, \\"but I don't feel as if it's better.\\" The first half of \\"Versed\\" focuses on the dark forces taking hold of the United States as it fought the war against Iraq. The second half looks at the dark forces casting a shadow over her own life after Armantrout was diagnosed with cancer in 2006. Armantrout was shocked to learn she had won the Pulitzer but many of her colleagues were not. \\"Rae Armantrout is a unique voice in American poetry,\\" said Seth Lerer, head of Arts and Humanities at UCSD. \\"Versed\\", published by the Wesleyan University Press, did appear in a larger printing than her earlier works, which is about 2,700 copies. The new edition is scheduled to appear in May. Question: Which of the following is true of Rae Armantrout? Options: A: She published a poetry textbook. B: She used to teach Denise Levertov.

Movie title: The League of Gentlemen Context: A manhole opens at night in an empty street and out climbs Lieutenant-Colonel Norman Hyde (Jack Hawkins) in a dinner suit. He gets into a Rolls-Royce and drives home. There, he prepares seven envelopes, each containing an American crime paperback called The Golden Fleece, half of a Â£5-note and an unsigned invitation from âCo-operative Removals Limitedâ to lunch at the Cafe Royal. The envelopes are sent to former army officers, each in desperate or humiliating circumstances. When they all turn up looking for the other half of the Â£5 notes which are handed out, Hyde asks their opinion of the novel which is about a robbery. They show little enthusiasm but Hyde then reveals each person's misdemeanors. Hyde has no criminal record but holds a grudge for being made redundant by the army after a long career. He intends to rob a bank using the team's skills, with equal shares of Â£100,000 or more for each man. The gang meet under the guise of an amateur dramatic society rehearsing Journeyâs End to discuss the plan before moving into Hydeâs house and living a military regimen of duties and fines for being out of line. Hyde knows that a million pounds in used notes is regularly delivered to a City of London bank and has details of the delivery. They raid an army training camp in Dorset for arms and supplies. Hyde, Mycroft, Porthill and Race distract soldiers by posing as senior officers on an unscheduled food inspection. The others steal weapons while posing as telephone repairmen, speaking in Irish accents to divert suspicion to the IRA. The gang rent a warehouse to prepare. Race steals vehicles including cars and a truck which are fitted with false number plates.

Paragraph: Mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion or position. This type of energy describes objects that are moving or could move. A moving ball can have energy from motion. An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy. Can you think of some other examples? Where does the energy of motion come from? It comes from the energy created by position. This energy is stored energy. This means it is not moving yet, but it has the potential to move. How can you store energy? The arrow gains energy from the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion. Can you think of some other ways to store energy using position? Question: \\"Is an arrow released from a bow an example of mechanical energy?\\" Answer: \\"No\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choices: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"Answer: (2). yes The paragraph talks about the concept of energy. It tells us that mechanical energy is the energy got from motion (anything that moves) or position. An arrow that has been released from a bow is an example of mechanical energy. When the bow is pulled back and the arrow is released, the arrow moves. This is the 'energy of motion'. So the answer is \\"yes\\". The answer \\"no\\" is wrong because the paragraph clearly tells us that anything that moves has mechanical energy, and an arrow released from a bow moves.

How do you do this: How can you lose weight?","completion":"Losing weight involves a combination of approaches focused on diet, physical activity, and lifestyle modifications. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way: 1. Set realistic goals: Begin by setting achievable short-term and long-term weight-loss goals. Consult a health professional or use an online calculator to estimate your daily calorie requirements, based on factors such as age, gender, height, weight, and activity level. 2. Create a calorie deficit: To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than your body requires. This can be achieved by reducing your calorie intake or increasing your physical activity. Aim for a calorie deficit of around 500 calories per day, which can result in a weight loss of about 1 pound per week. 3. Focus on a balanced diet: A well-balanced diet should include a variety of foods from all food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Ensure you are getting all the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals necessary for optimal health. 4. Watch your portion sizes: Overeating, even healthy foods, can hinder your weight loss efforts. Practice portion control by using smaller plates, measuring out servings, and being mindful of hunger and satiety signals. 5. Keep a food journal: Maintaining a food diary can help you track your daily calorie intake, monitor your eating habits, and identify areas for improvement. It can also help you stay accountable and motivated. 6. Stay hydrated: Drinking water can help control your appetite, boost metabolism, and aid in digestion. Aim to drink at least 8 cups (64 ounces) of water per day, and consider consuming more if you are physically active. 7. Exercise regularly: Engaging in regular physical activity can help you burn calories, build muscle mass, and improve overall fitness. Combine both cardiovascular (aerobic) exercises, such as walking, running, swimming, or cycling, with strength training exercises, like weightlifting or body-weight exercises, for a well-rounded workout regimen. 8. Get enough sleep: Poor sleep can affect your weight loss efforts by increasing your appetite and hindering your ability to make good food choices. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. 9. Manage stress: Chronic stress can lead to weight gain and make it harder to lose weight. Incorporate stress-reduction practices into your daily routine, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. 10. Seek support: Having a support system, whether in the form of friends, family, or a weight-loss group, can provide motivation, encouragement, and accountability throughout your weight-loss journey. 11. Avoid quick fixes: Fad diets and weight-loss supplements may promise rapid results, but they often lack long-term effectiveness and can harm your health. Focus on making permanent lifestyle changes that promote healthy weight loss and maintenance. 12. Be patient and consistent: Weight loss takes time and requires consistent effort. Do not be disheartened if you do not see immediate results. Stick to your plan and remember that progress, no matter how small, is still progress. Remember, it's essential to consult with your healthcare professional before beginning any weight loss plan, particularly if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking medications. They can help you create a personalized weight loss plan that best suits your needs and ensures your safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Bewildered, he is befriended by Alison Smith (Sheila Sim), a London salesgirl turned landgirl and Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price), a British soldier on his way back to camp outside the village. As they leave the station, a mysterious figure jumps from the shadows and pours glue on Alison's hair. Bob and Peter give chase to the town hall, but the only person there is the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer for whom Alison has come to work. She learns that she is the glueman's eleventh victim, and that Colpeper has no use for inexperienced landgirls. Next day, she gets a job on another farm, while Bob, curious about the glueman's identity, decides to stay on to help expose him. While attending a lantern-slide lecture about the Pilgrim's Way by Colpeper (well-attended since few local girls are willing to go out at night with servicemen for fear of the glueman), Bob, Peter and Alison all come under the spell of Colpeper's words. Alison is already familiar with this part of the country from a pre-war holiday with her archaeologist fiancé, now missing, presumed dead, in action. Bob also fears that he has lost his girlfriend, who is not answering his letters. Peter is a cynic who studied classical music but opted instead for the money he can earn as a cinema organist. With gangs of children enlisted in unmasking the glueman, all the evidence points to Colpeper. Confronted on the train into Canterbury, he confesses but pleads that he did it for the 'higher good': not only preventing local girls from taking up with GIs while their husbands/boyfriends are away at war, but boosting attendances at his lectures on the national heritage. Peter intends to alert the police but, once in Canterbury, the trio of pilgrims find the blessings they receive outweigh any desire to bring the glueman to book.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"The question you've asked is not entirely clear, so let me try to understand what you might be asking, and then offer a response. You've given an overview of the wine-making process, and then mentioned food particles entering jets. This mention of jets is somewhat confusing and feels disconnected from the wine-making process. However, assuming you're asking about how the presence of food particles would affect grape crushing and fermentation, let's continue. If food particles were present during grape crushing, there is a possibility that these particles would mix with the crushed grapes, affecting the purity of the grape juice (also called must) that eventually goes into the fermentation container. This impurity could potentially impact the fermentation process, the flavor of the wine, or even the clarity of the final product. Now, in terms of the second effect mentioned, I believe you're referring to the yeast being added to the container, which then consumes the sugar from the grapes and produces alcohol. If less grapes are crushed because of the presence of food particles or some other obstacle, this could lead to a reduction in the sugar content of the grape must that goes into the fermentation process. This reduction in sugar content will have a direct effect on the final alcohol content of the wine. When there is less sugar available for the yeast to consume, it will produce less alcohol as a byproduct. Therefore, the effect of fewer grapes being crushed and the presence of food particles in the process could potentially lead to a lower alcohol content in the final wine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Experts say that to stay healthy, children need at least one hour of moderate exercise every day. But only six out of ten boys and four out of ten girls get that. One of the reasons is that parents have developed a habit of driving their children to school when they could just walk or ride a bike to school. Teachers often say that children who walk or ride a bike to school are more ready to listen to their classes, ask and answer questions in class than those driven by car, and the school journey is a good chance for children to learn about road safety and other life skills. Also, for many children, riding a bike is more fun than going to school by car. Most parents know the benefits . Then what's stopping them from letting their kids ride a bike?

The answers are important enough that they will be a discussion topic of this year's Senior Day at 9 a.m. March 25 in the House Chamber at the Capitol. The following is a preview of some of the answers for review: We can all agree that older Oklahomans need medical care. But even the best care is worthless if an older patient can't drive to the doctor for ongoing treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt dispute. Therefore, lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 Oklahomans age 60 and older. Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment. Lawyers know how to make landlords heat apartments so the medical treatment can stick. (By the way, a May 16, 2001, article in The New York Times reports on a program at Boston Medical Center providing a walk-in legal clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients' legal and administrative battles.) We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process. \\"Old\\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights. Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices. It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use. In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights. They are not to be used to help a family \\"manage\\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient. Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them. But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents. Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems. All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents. Question: \\"What can lawyers do for old people?\\" Response: \\"It is the Lawyers duty to help Older Oklahomans\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph provided. The paragraph mentions several instances where older Oklahomans require the assistance of lawyers, such as debt disputes, housing issues, health care decisions, and taking care of grandchildren. The role of lawyers in these situations is crucial in ensuring that older Oklahomans have appropriate legal representation and protection of their rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please capitalize where necessary: greenland in 50 years","completion":"Greenland in 50 Years: In 50 years, numerous changes are expected to occur in Greenland, which encompass various sectors such as climate, environment, politics, and social development. These changes will continue to shape the country's future significantly. The following paragraphs outline some of these potential developments and their implications. Climate Change: As global temperatures continue to rise, the effects of climate change are expected to become more apparent in Greenland. An increase in annual average temperatures could lead to accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which is the second-largest ice mass in the world. This will subsequently result in a rise in global sea levels, causing flooding in coastal areas and posing risks to communities worldwide. Furthermore, as the Arctic region continues to warm, Greenland may experience drastic changes in precipitation patterns, affecting its ecosystems and water resources. Environment: In the coming decades, environmental shifts in Greenland could lead to a transformation of its unique landscape. Melting ice could expose previously inaccessible regions, which will likely result in increased human activity such as mining, fishing, and tourism. These activities may contribute to environmental degradation and put pressure on the delicate Arctic ecosystems. As a consequence, the native flora and fauna of Greenland may be threatened, with the potential for some species to face extinction. Politics: Greenland's political landscape may also change significantly in the next 50 years. As its natural resources become more accessible, the country is expected to gain more international attention. This could lead to increased pressure from other nations, particularly those with interest in the Arctic, such as the United States, Russia, and China, to strengthen their political and economic ties with Greenland. Furthermore, as a territory of Denmark, Greenland may seek to renegotiate its relationship and pursue greater autonomy or even full independence. Socioeconomic Development: Over the next 50 years, socioeconomic development in Greenland will likely be driven by the changes in its climate and political context. Improvements in infrastructure, education, and healthcare may result from increased investment and collaboration with foreign countries. However, as the economy shifts toward natural resource extraction, there may be a need to address potential issues related to labor and income inequality, environmental sustainability, and cultural preservation of the Indigenous population. In conclusion, Greenland in 50 years is expected to undergo numerous transformations driven by factors such as climate change, environmental shifts, political dynamics, and socioeconomic development. The melting ice, political relations, and environmental issues will play major roles in shaping the country's future landscape. It is crucial for Greenland's government and the global community to work together in addressing these challenges and creating a sustainable future for its population and the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilot who was part of the 1949/1950 tour of South Africa was Keith Ross Miller. Born on November 28, 1919, in Sunshine, Victoria, Australia, Miller was not only a skilled aviator but also a prominent cricketer, often regarded as one of the all-time great all-rounders in the sport. Miller attended Melbourne High School and later went on to play cricket professionally. He made his debut on the Australian cricket team, the Baggy Greens, in 1946, earning a reputation for his aggressive batting, exceptional bowling skills, and powerful presence on the field. Additionally, he captained Victoria in Australian domestic cricket and played for New South Wales. When World War II erupted, Miller put his sporting career on hold to enlist in the armed forces. He joined the RAAF in October 1942, and after completing his training, he was assigned as a pilot officer to the United Kingdom. There, he served with the RAAF's No. 169 Squadron, where he flew night fighter operations and was responsible for protecting the UK mainland from enemy attacks. Later, Miller was posted to No. 616 Squadron, where he flew the de Havilland Mosquito, a formidable ground attack aircraft, until the war ended in 1945. In the post-war era, Miller resumed his cricket career, enjoying great success both as a player and a respected leader. Notably, he was part of Sir Donald Bradman's Invincibles, the Australian cricket team that toured England without losing a single match in 1948. The following year, in 1949, Miller was appointed the vice-captain of the Australian cricket team that toured South Africa from 1949 to 1950. During this tour, under the captaincy of Lindsay Hassett, Australia played a five-match Test series against South Africa. Miller's all-rounder capabilities shone through, and he contributed significantly to the team's success, resulting in a clean sweep victory for Australia. Miller played a total of 55 Test matches throughout his career and scored 2,958 runs at an average of 36.97, while taking 170 Test wickets at an average of 22.97. Due to his dual accomplishments as both a cricketer and an RAAF pilot, Keith Miller has left an indelible mark in Australian sports and military history. He passed away on October 11, 2004, at the age of 84, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Would \\"Other types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified .\\" be a reasonable answer? Choices: [A]. No. [B]. Yes. The answer is:","completion":"A: No. A more detailed answer would be that while the statement \\"Other types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified.\\" provides factual information about different categories of eating disorders, it might not be a suitable response when talking to someone with an eating disorder. Conversations with individuals struggling with eating disorders should focus on providing support, understanding, and empathy, rather than simply listing types of eating disorders. When speaking with someone who has an eating disorder, it is essential to be sensitive and supportive. Many people with eating disorders feel ashamed, embarrassed, or guilty about their condition. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid judgments, criticisms, or comments that might make them feel worse about themselves or their situation. Here are some suggestions for things not to say to someone with an eating disorder, and a few helpful alternatives: 1. Don't say: \\"Why don't you just eat more/less?\\" Instead, say: \\"I can't fully understand what you're experiencing, but I'm here to support you and listen without judgment.\\" 2. Don't say: \\"You don't look like you have an eating disorder.\\" Instead, say: \\"Eating disorders can affect people of all shapes and sizes, and it's important to focus on your feelings and experiences rather than appearances.\\" 3. Don't say: \\"Eating disorders are just a phase, you'll grow out of it.\\" Instead, say: \\"Recovery is a process that takes time, and I'll be here with you every step of the way.\\" 4. Don't say: \\"You're doing this for attention.\\" Instead, say: \\"It's brave of you to open up about your struggle, and I'm here to help you find the support you need.\\" 5. Don't say: \\"Just be more disciplined about your eating habits.\\" Instead, say: \\"Recovery from an eating disorder is a complex journey that involves physical, emotional, and psychological aspects. We can find professional help to guide you through this process.\\" Remember, when talking to someone with an eating disorder, it is crucial to be patient, non-judgmental, and empathetic. Offer support and reassurance, and encourage them to seek professional help from a qualified mental health professional if they haven't already."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum might have had a little same-sex fling on the side. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early-20s during his stint on \\"The Surreal Life\\", which at first was fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship. The last episode, where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to Christopher for his birthday, was not a good move on her part. And he dealt with it in a very mature fashion, just picking up and leaving to clear his head. I think he was always bowing to her every need and now he's finally taking a stand. And I hate to say it, but I think she abuses him, verbally. The way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing. Also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men, which is not something any self-respecting human being should do when already married to someone. If this were a man talking down to his wife like that, and going out every night partying and having sex with other people, everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language in the text provided is French. This particular language is native to France and is officially spoken in many different countries worldwide, across several continents. French, in its standardized form known as Standard French or Parisian French, is an Indo-European language belonging to the Romance group of languages. It evolved from the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. French's development was also influenced over the centuries by various other languages and groups, including the Celts, the Romans, the Franks, and the English. French is the official language in 29 countries, like Belgium, Canada, Rwanda, Cameroon, and Haiti. Likewise, it holds a prominent position in many international and multinational companies, organizations, and institutions, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Olympic Committee, to name a few. Besides, French is the second most studied foreign language after English and is considered an international language of literature and scientific standards. Also, it is one of the six official languages and one of the two working languages (the other being English) of the United Nations, and it is the official language of the Universal Postal Union.

A lifeless and disappointing adaptation of the source material, lacking the essence that made the original interesting. 4.

Question: Was the general that was killed in 1176 married at the time of his death? Passage:A member of the Aspietes family, of noble Armenian origin, Constantine was probably a close relative of his contemporary Michael Aspietes, a distinguished general killed in 1176. Like his relative, Constantine too had earned distinction during Manuel I Komnenos' campaign against the Hungarians in 1167. The historian John Kinnamos records that he held the rank of sebastos. He is next recorded as being active in 1190/1, during the Byzantine efforts to suppress the Bulgarian–Vlach rebellion of the brothers Peter and Ivan Asen. The historian Niketas Choniates records that, in an effort to sustain the troops and bolster their morale, Aspietes decided to distribute to them their delayed annual salaries. This act, however, enraged Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who saw in it almost an attempt to bribe the army to support Aspietes in overthrowing him. The emperor had Aspietes arrested and blinded, after which nothing further is known of him. He possibly died in the early years of the 13th century. Links: a. Michael Aspietes b. Aspietes c.

Write highlights for this article: Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi said Friday that elections taking place this weekend would not be \\"free and fair\\" but that her party still hoped to win as many parliamentary seats as possible. Suu Kyi, who was released in 2010 by Myanmar's military rulers after years under house arrest, said that she believed there had been voting irregularities, illegal activities and intimidation either committed or encouraged by official entities. But Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy figure and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said at a news conference outside her residence in Yangon that she did not \\"at all regret having taken part\\" because the election campaign had raised political awareness among Myanmar's population. Worldwide attention is focused on the April elections, which are seen as a test of the Myanmar government's commitment to removing the fear and paranoia of citizens silenced by nearly five decades of military rule. The government has invited in hundreds of foreign journalists and election observers to witness the voting. The vote, in which credible alternatives to the ruling party will appear on the ballot, was called to fill seats vacated by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year. Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), is in competition for 44 of the 45 seats up for grabs in the by-elections. It had boycotted previous elections. Its candidate in one constituency has been rejected by the election commission because his parents had taken up foreign residency, Suu Kyi said, adding that the party planned to challenge the candidate's exclusion later. The international community has applauded recent steps toward greater openness in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962. The generals are loosening their grip after international sanctions and criticism over their regime's human rights record. So far this year, the regime has agreed to negotiate with an ethnic rebel group and pardoned hundreds of political prisoners. Top diplomats from the United States, Britain and France have made recent visits to the country after decades of shunning it. Suu Kyi said she believed President Thein Sein, a former general who has taken civilian office, wished for democratic reform, but that she was uncertain how much support he had, notably from the military. She told the hundreds of journalists gathered outside her residence Friday that she didn't plan on becoming a minister in the military-backed civilian government, if a position was offered to her. Under Myanmar's constitution, lawmakers can't hold ministerial office. Asked where she would place Myanmar's democracy on a scale of one to 10, Suu Kyi quipped, \\"We're trying to get to one.\\" She mentioned two recent physical attacks against NLD candidates, which she said she thought were actions of individuals rather than state-sponsored acts. In one of the attacks, somebody used a catapult to fire betel nuts at a candidate's car, she said. Some people in Southeast Asia chew betel nuts as a mild stimulant. The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi herself became an inspiration with her long struggle for democracy in the country. She quietly defied Myanmar's military junta for years from from the prison of her crumbling Inya Lake villa in the former capital, Yangon. Suu Kyi, 66, is now a candidate for the parliamentary seat in Kawhmu, a contest analysts say she is all but certain to win. Results are expected about a week after the voting. Suu Kyi has been crisscrossing the country to attend election rallies where she is often greeted like a rock star. But her busy schedule has taken its toll: earlier this week she had to suspend campaigning after falling ill. On Friday, she said she felt somewhat \\"delicate,\\" but was in good enough spirits to joke about her health. She told the reporters at the news conference that if they asked \\"any tough questions, I'll faint straight away.\\" CNN's Paula Hancocks reported from Yangon, and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.","completion":"Myanmar opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, claims that the upcoming elections will not be \\"free and fair\\" due to numerous irregularities, illegal activities, and intimidation by official entities. Despite her concerns, Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), still aim to win as many parliamentary seats as possible. The NLD is in the running for 44 of the 45 seats available in the by-elections. The Myanmar government's commitment to overcoming the fear and paranoia of citizens established by nearly five decades of military rule is being tested by these April elections. The government is allowing hundreds of foreign journalists and election observers to document the voting process. Furthermore, the international community is taking note of Myanmar's movement toward increased openness after enduring many years of sanctions and criticism for their human rights record. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, acknowledges President Thein Sein's desire for democratic reform but expresses uncertainty regarding the level of support he has, particularly from the military. She also clarifies that she does not intend to hold a ministerial position within the military-backed civilian government if it is offered to her, as the constitution for Myanmar prohibits lawmakers from holding ministerial office. Despite recent setbacks in her campaign due to health issues, Suu Kyi continues to actively participate in election rallies throughout the country, where she garners strong support and enthusiasm. Election results are expected one week after voting takes place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The population is an important unit in ecology as well as other biological sciences. How is a population defined, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of this definition? Are there some species that at certain times or places are not in populations?. Q: During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for what, by accumulating energy and building blocks of dna? Choices: - proteins division - chromosome division - technology division - cell division A: The answer is:","completion":"cell division Before diving into the answer, let's first clarify how it relates to the given paragraph, which discusses populations and their relevance in ecology and biological sciences. While the question itself is not directly related to populations or ecology, it does concern a fundamental biological process: cell division, and cells are the structural and functional units of all living organisms. Understanding how cells divide and grow is essential to understanding populations and the life cycles of species. Now, onto the main question about interphase, which is a stage in the life cycle of a cell. During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes and also prepares for cell division. The process of cell division is crucial because it is the means by which living organisms grow, develop, and reproduce. Interphase is typically divided into three phases: G1, S, and G2. 1. G1 (Gap 1) phase: The cell grows in size, synthesizes proteins and other cellular components, and checks for any damage to its DNA. The cell accumulates energy and the necessary building blocks (nucleotides) to undergo the next phase, the S phase. During G1, the cell also checks for signals from the body or its environment that might indicate whether it should continue to grow and divide or not. 2. S (Synthesis) phase: In this phase, the cell duplicates its entire DNA, forming two identical copies of each chromosome. These copies will later be distributed to the two daughter cells during cell division. DNA replication is carried out by various proteins, such as DNA polymerase, which synthesizes the new DNA strand using the old strand as a template. 3. G2 (Gap 2) phase: The cell undergoes further growth, synthesizes more proteins, and checks its DNA for any errors that occurred during the replication process in the S phase. The cell prepares the machinery for the next step of cell division: mitosis or meiosis. So, given the question options (proteins division, chromosome division, technology division, and cell division), the best answer is \\"cell division.\\" During interphase, the cell grows, duplicates its DNA, synthesizes proteins and other components, and prepares to divide into two daughter cells through the process of cell division, ensuring the continuation of life within various populations and ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After checking price's, I decided to buy treatment from the store rather than the dermatologist's office for my acne, because the Pick from: (a). store was cheaper.; (b). dermatologist's office was cheaper.;","completion":"After checking the prices, I decided to buy treatment from the store rather than the dermatologist's office for my acne, because the store was cheaper. This decision was influenced by multiple factors, including convenience, product variety, accessibility, and overall value for money. Firstly, the store offered a wider selection of treatments and products at various price points. From over-the-counter creams, gels, and face washes to medications and remedies for different skin types and acne severity, the store provided a vast array of options for me to choose from. This allowed me to find a product catering to my specific needs and preferences while also keeping my budget intact. In contrast, the dermatologist's office had a limited range of products, mostly including prescription medications and treatments that could be costly. While these might have been more effective in some cases, I concluded that it was worth testing an affordable store-bought product first before committing to a professional treatment. Furthermore, purchasing an acne treatment from the store allowed for greater convenience and accessibility. Many stores have extended hours of operation or even 24-hour access, making it much easier for me to buy the required product whenever needed. On the other hand, I would have had to make an appointment with the dermatologist and potentially wait several weeks to see them regarding my acne concerns. Moreover, the store's products typically come with clear instructions and guidelines for usage, enabling me to start the treatment immediately upon purchase. This further adds to the convenience factor and allows me to treat my acne sooner, with the hope of witnessing positive results in a shorter period. An additional point to consider is that, in many cases, store-bought acne treatments are backed by a money-back guarantee or return policy if unsatisfied with the product. This presents a safety net for me and ensures that I can switch to another treatment without facing a significant financial loss. While it is true that a dermatologist would better cater to my needs and provide a more personalized treatment plan, my decision to opt for a store-bought product was based on a careful assessment of the aforementioned factors. By selecting a cost-effective store option, I gained access to a wide variety of treatments, suitable for various acne types and severity levels, which ultimately offered me the opportunity to explore multiple approaches while keeping expenses to a minimum. Therefore, it was the affordability, convenience, product variety, and accessibility provided by the store that made it more appealing for me to purchase an acne treatment there rather than in a dermatologist’s office, which had higher costs and fewer treatment options readily available for immediate purchase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These are two distinct processes involving different raw materials and production methods. The process of fermenting grapes remains the same, regardless of people's preferences for the strength of their coffee. The hypothesis might have a potential indirect effect if people's preference for weaker coffee leads to increased consumption of alternative beverages, such as wine, because they perceive it as a better alternative.

Polarization is the sum of the E-plane orientations over time projected onto an imaginary plane perpendicular to the direction of motion of the radio wave. In the most general case, polarization is elliptical, meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time. Two special cases are linear polarization (the ellipse collapses into a line) as we have discussed above, and circular polarization (in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal). In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation. Circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as right-handed or left-handed using the \\"thumb in the direction of the propagation\\" rule.

Charlottesville has eighteen distinctive neighborhoods. It is named after the British Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the City of Charlottesville with the County of Albemarle for statistical purposes, bringing its steadily growing population to approximately 150,000. Charlottesville is the heart of the Charlottesville metropolitan area, which includes Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene and Nelson counties. - Bella Morte is a gothic band that was formed in 1996 in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. They incorporate elements of metal, dark wave, deathrock, alternative and synthpop. The band's name means \\"beautiful death\\" in Italian. According to Andy Deane, the name was chosen to \\"suggest that beauty can be found in tragedy\\", which is a theme occurring in every Bella Morte album. - Founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1993, Metropolis Records has developed a strong reputation over the years as a leader in various genres of underground music. Though widely known for electro-industrial, synthpop, future pop, darkwave, and gothic music, the label has always operated with a bent towards all genres of dark alternative music, be it electronics-based or post-punk. - Bleed the Grey Sky Black is Bella Morte 's fourth release on Metropolis Records . It reached # 1 on Metropolis ' pre-order sales in September 2006 . - Dark wave or darkwave is a musical term used for dark, usually gothic rock-influenced music that incorporates synthesizers, or elements of new wave and synthpop, although the term is also applied to post-punk bands that produce a dark atmosphere. The label began to appear in the late 1970s in German music media, coinciding with the popularity of new wave and post-punk. Building on those basic principles, dark wave is used to describe dark, introspective lyrics and an undertone of sorrow for some bands. In the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose members were called \\"wavers\\" or \\"dark wavers\\". - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. - Electro-industrial is a music genre drawing on EBM and post-industrial that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the \\"dark electro\\" genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the \\"aggrotech\\" offshoot. The fan base for the style is linked to the rivethead subculture. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A recent study, while showing a generally positive attitude toward science, also suggests a widespread worry that it may be \\"running out of control\\". This idea is dangerous. Science can be a force for evil as well as for good. Its applications can be channeled either way, depending on our decisions. The decisions we make, personally or collectively, will determine the outcomes of science. But here is a real danger. Science is advancing so fast is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference. And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of \\"controlling\\" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques. The outcomes are hard to predict. Therefore, discussions on how science is applied should be extended far beyond scientific societies. Only through the united efforts of people with hope, can we be fully safe against the misuse of science and can science best serve mankind in the future. Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Answer: Possible answers: (a). Science and its applications bring us many dangers.. (b). The development of science mostly lies in people's attitudes.. (c). Mankind can largely take control of science with their efforts.. (d). The future of science will be influenced by the dangerous ideas.. A:","completion":"The main idea of the passage is: (c). Mankind can largely take control of science with their efforts. The author emphasizes the importance of making decisions and taking united efforts to ensure the responsible use of science, rather than giving in to a sense of hopelessness or fear that it will become uncontrollable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Often people may be awakened by a group of carolers beginning to gather at the church. They return home to make final preparation as to the clothes one must wear and also as to his offering for the Christmas service. The most important part of their Christmas service is the love offering. This is the gift in honor of Jesus. At about 8 or 9 o'clock, everyone makes their way to the celebration of the birthday of Jesus. Everyone who attends the service goes forward to lay down their gift upon the raised platform near the Communion table. Not one person will attend the service without giving a gift. Christmas in South Africa is a summer holiday. There is no snow, but it has many flowers, many beautiful varieties of wild flowers being in their full pride.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques. Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \\"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\\".In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \\"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique.

Options: - driveway - gallbladder - river bed - quarry - creek bed The answer is \\"river bed\\" because A:","completion":"As they skipped stones, they were looking for new ones in the \\"river bed\\" because: Step 1: Identify the context of the question. The question is about a location where people are looking for stones to skip, indicating that they are likely near a water body. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options. - \\"driveway\\" does not make sense in the context of skipping stones, as driveways are typically not near water bodies, and stones found there may not be ideal for skipping. - \\"gallbladder\\" is an internal organ in the body and unrelated to the context of skipping stones. Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options. - \\"quarry\\" is a possibility, but quarries are not typically associated with water bodies where people would be skipping stones. - \\"creek bed\\" is a possibility, as creeks can have water bodies with stones ideal for skipping. However, creek beds are generally smaller and contain less water than river beds, so the likelihood of finding suitable stones is lower. - \\"river bed\\" is most appropriate because river beds are commonly associated with water bodies, and they typically contain an abundance of smooth, flat stones ideal for skipping.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Photo That Changed America's Civil Rights Movement The raw videos depict the last moments of Philando Castile‘s and Alton Sterling‘s lives. Widely shared on social media – one of them live – they have shocked an entire nation. Like the videos that showed the killings of Walter L. Scott, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner in 2014 and 2015, they provide the necessary imagery to force us to address, once again, the pervasive and inherent racial inequalities that still exist across the country. More than 60 years ago, when racial segregation was still the norm in many states, one grieving mother, Mamie Elizabeth Till-Mobley, understood the power of imagery to expose America’s racism. In August 1955, Emmett Till, a black teenager from Chicago, was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he stopped at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. There he encountered Carolyn Bryant, a white woman. Whether Till really flirted with Bryant or whistled at her isn’t known. But what happened four days later is. Bryant’s husband Roy and his half brother, J.W. Milam, seized the 14-year-old from his great-uncle’s house. The pair then beat Till, shot him, and strung barbed wire and a 75-pound metal fan around his neck and dumped the lifeless body in the Tallahatchie River. A white jury quickly acquitted the men, with one juror saying it had taken so long only because they had to break to drink some pop. When Till’s mother Mamie came to identify her son, she told the funeral director, “Let the people see what I’ve seen.” She brought him home to Chicago and insisted on an open casket. Tens of thousands filed past Till’s remains, but it was the publication of the searing image photographed by David Jackson and first published in Jet magazine, with a stoic Mamie gazing at her murdered child’s ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism. For almost a century, African Americans were lynched with regularity and impunity. Now, thanks to a mother’s determination to expose the barbarousness of the crime, the public could no longer pretend to ignore what they couldn’t see. In this video narrated by Bryan Stevenson, an attorney and the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, has no doubt: “Without the images,” he says “no one would be prepared to believe the violence we’ve witnessed.” In revisiting Jackson’s photograph today, he believes, “that image still has resonance, it still has power. I think it still expresses the pain and anguish of a huge part of our population that is still hoping for basic recognition of their humanity.”","completion":"This news article talks about a very sad event that happened a long time ago in 1955, which helped change how people felt about treating others differently just because of their skin color. A young boy named Emmett Till was hurt really badly by two men just because he may have talked to a white woman. Emmett's mom, Mamie, wanted everyone to see how bad racism could be, so she let people take pictures of Emmett after he was hurt. Those pictures made many people realize that racism is wrong and that everyone should be treated fairly. Even today, some people still struggle with racism, but we can learn from Emmett's story to treat everyone with kindness and respect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hands Google Big Win: The Federal Trade Commission found that Google did not violate antitrust and anticompetition laws, clearing the way for the company to further dominate the Web search field. WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday handed Google a major victory by declaring, after an investigation of nearly two years, that the company had not violated antitrust or anticompetition statutes in the way it arranges its Web search results. By allowing Google to continue to present search results that highlight its own services, the F.T.C. decision could enable Google to further strengthen its already dominant position on the Internet. It also enables Google to avoid a costly and lengthy legal war of attrition like the antitrust battle that Microsoft waged in the 1990s. That fight took an enormous toll on Microsoft and opened the door for competitors like Google to become the technology sector’s new leaders. Now, a weakened Microsoft was among those most vocal in complaining that Google was unfairly abusing a monopolistic position to thwart its rivals. Google, which attracts 70 percent of all search queries in the United States, has used its search business, which generates billions of dollars in profit annually from advertising, to expand into businesses that include maps, restaurant reviews and travel bookings. Competitors worry that the F.T.C.’s decision will allow Google to continue to make inroads at their expense. The decision sets up a potential conflict with European officials, who are working with Google to resolve similar concerns about the way the company operates its search engine in Europe, where it is even more dominant than in the United States. Web search has become vital to the success of many businesses. Being ranked higher in search results can mean a great deal more traffic and revenue; being ranked lower can hurt both. Google has long claimed that it uses a neutral algorithm for search queries, something that competitors disputed. But Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the F.T.C., said that “While not everything Google did was beneficial, on balance we did not believe that the evidence supported an F.T.C. challenge to this aspect of Google’s business under American law.” The five-member commission voted unanimously to close its investigation without bringing charges, although some staff members argued vigorously that Google should face sanctions for using online search results to draw consumer traffic to its own services. The F.T.C. said it had found that Google’s practices improved its search results for the benefit of users and that “any negative impact on actual or perceived competitors was incidental to that purpose.” Google did agree to make some minor changes to its search practices related to search advertising. The F.T.C. said those commitments were enforceable if the company violated them, but the agreement avoided a formal consent decree or litigation, weapons that the F.T.C. had available. One F.T.C. commissioner, J. Thomas Rosch, said in a partial dissent that the commission would not be able to hold Google to its promises in any meaningful way, as it might do through a contempt proceeding or a fine. Competitors said the war was not over. Fairsearch.org, a group of Google rivals including Microsoft, said Thursday’s action left the F.T.C. “without a major role in the final resolution to the investigations of Google’s anticompetitive practices by state attorneys general and the European Commission. The F.T.C.’s inaction on the core question of search bias will only embolden Google to act more aggressively to misuse its monopoly power to harm other innovators.” In a less-watched part of the investigation, which will have a less direct impact on consumers, the commission found that Google had misused its broad patents on cellphone technology, and it ordered Google to make that technology available to rivals. That order may benefit phone manufacturers that use either Google’s Android operating system or competing systems. Some F.T.C. officials said that in the long run, the sanctions could be a bigger victory for consumers, encouraging the development of more innovative devices. But the broadest impact of the F.T.C.’s action is to present more competitive challenges to companies that do specialty searches, for things like travel or shopping. Consumers will continue to see what has now become familiar on Google — the presence of results that link to Google’s other businesses. When a consumer searches for “airfare to Los Angeles,” for example, the most prominent results are generated by Google’s own travel business, rather than by the likes of Expedia, Priceline or Kayak. On the company’s Web site, David Drummond, a senior vice president at Google and its chief legal officer, wrote, “The conclusion is clear: Google’s services are good for users and good for competition.” Mr. Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman, called Google’s lifting of content from other Web sites “the most troubling of its business practices related to search and search advertising.” The company agreed to stop taking its rivals’ content, particularly reviews of things like restaurants or consumer products, for use in its own specialized search results. Yelp, a consumer review site, complained that Google took parts of its reviews and placed them in its own results. When competitors objected, Google threatened to remove them entirely from results, something Mr. Leibowitz said “is clearly problematic and potentially harmful to competition because it might harm incentives to innovate.” Google also agreed to stop contractual restrictions that prevented small businesses from advertising on competing search platforms. Last year, some F.T.C. staff members pushed hard in reports to the commission that the company’s actions constituted “unfair methods of competition,” an area that, like that of antitrust, is policed by the F.T.C. But the trade commission faced a struggle in proving malicious intent — that Google changes its search algorithm to purposely harm competitors and favor itself. Antitrust lawyers say anticompetitive behavior cannot be proved simply by showing that a change in the algorithm affects other Web sites and causes sites to show up lower in results, even though studies have shown that users rarely look beyond the first page of search results. ||||| Google will resolve a 20-month antitrust probe by U.S. regulators tomorrow with a voluntary agreement and a consent decree.

Read More Google will resolve a 20-month antitrust probe by U.S. regulators tomorrow with a voluntary agreement and a consent decree. Close Google Inc. (GOOG) will resolve a 20-month antitrust probe by U.S. regulators today with a voluntary agreement and a consent decree on the company’s alleged misuse of patents, three people familiar with the matter said. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is poised to announce that Google has agreed to voluntarily change some business practices and settle allegations it misused patents to thwart competitors in smartphone technology, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision isn’t public. The FTC is expected to close its investigation into whether Google, operator of the world’s most popular search engine, skews its search results to favor its own services without enforcement action, the people said. The FTC’s decision not to take action is a blow to competitors including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Yelp Inc. (YELP) and Expedia Inc. (EXPE) and comes at a time when the European Union is seeking a “detailed commitment” on search to end its probe into allegations that Google discriminates against rivals. As part of its voluntary concessions, Google will make changes in the way it uses content from other websites and allow advertisers to export data to other platforms, the people said.

Peter Kaplan, a spokesman for the FTC, and Niki Fenwick, a Google spokeswoman, declined to comment on the resolution of the probe. Google Opponents The expected FTC decision was drawing criticism from Google opponents, including the FairSearch.org coalition, an alliance that includes Microsoft and Expedia. “If the FTC fails to take decisive action to end Google’s anti-competitive practices, and locks itself out of any remedies to Google’s conduct that are offered in Europe later this month, the FTC will have acted prematurely and failed in its mission of protecting America’s consumers,” according to a FairSearch.org blogpost published yesterday. In another blogpost yesterday, Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel Dave Heiner accused Google of anticompetitive practices, including continuing “to prevent Microsoft from offering consumers a fully featured YouTube app for the Windows Phone.” Microsoft has complained about the issue both to the EU and the FTC, Heiner said. Google has blocked Microsoft’s new Windows Phones from operating properly with YouTube, while enabling its own Android phones to access YouTube, Heiner said in the posting. “These restrictions are just one example of where we believe Google is impeding competition in the marketplace,” Heiner wrote in the posting.

U.S. antitrust regulators added that they have found no evidence to claims that Google unfairly favors its own services in search results. Google did agree to license patents deemed to be \\"essential\\" for rival mobile devices such as Apple Inc.'s iPhone, Research in Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry and smartphones running on a Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software. Some of the patents in question came as part of Google's 12.4 billion acquisition of device maker Motorola Mobility Holdings earlier this year. Regulators say Google is also promising that upon request, it will exclude snippets copied from other websites in its summaries of key information, even though the company had insisted the practice is legal under the fair-use provisions of U.S. copyright law. Despite the fair-use practice, Google already had scaled back on the amount of cribbing, or \\"scraping,\\" of online content after business review site Yelp Inc. lodged one of the complaints that triggered the FTC investigation. The FTC's investigation focused on allegations that Google has been abusing its dominance in Internet search. Google's rivals, including Microsoft Corp., say the search company has been highlighting its own services on its influential results page while burying the links to competing sites. Google Inc. has fiercely defended its right to recommend the websites that it believes are the most relevant. The FTC said it saw no evidence of wrongdoing in those recommendations. Google's stock rose 4.11 to 727.36 in afternoon trading Thursday. Microsoft is down 28 cents at 27.34. |||||","completion":"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Google for nearly two years to see if the company broke any rules about being fair to other businesses on the internet. They wanted to find out if Google was playing favorites with its own services in search results. After the investigation, the FTC decided that Google did not break any rules, and they will allow Google to continue showing search results that highlight its own services. This decision is important because it helps Google stay strong on the internet and lets them keep growing. However, some companies like Microsoft are not happy with the decision because they think Google has an unfair advantage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a test of commonsense. Complete the next sentence: How to stop being judgmental and prejudiced Learn why prejudice exists. This can help you understand the roots of your thinking. Studies indicate people are born with an innate tendency to be drawn to those similar to them and judge those who are different.","completion":"To stop being judgmental and prejudiced, one should take several steps that involve self-awareness, education, empathy, open-mindedness, and practicing kindness and fairness towards others. 1. Reflect on your beliefs and attitudes: Before you can change your behavior, you must first acknowledge and understand why you are judgmental and prejudiced. Reflect on your personal experiences, upbringing, and social influences that have shaped your perspective. Try to identify any influences that have contributed to your judgments and prejudices, such as family, friends, media, or stereotypes. 2. Educate yourself: Acquire knowledge about different cultures, religions, disability types, genders, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This will help you become more aware of the diversity in the world and appreciate the common values and shared humanity that unite people. Your increased understanding will help break down barriers and misconceptions about others that contribute to judgment and prejudice. 3. Develop empathy: Imagining yourself in someone else's shoes is a powerful way to develop empathy. When you try to understand others' feelings and experiences, you can better appreciate their situations, challenges, and perspectives. This understanding builds compassion and connection, reducing the likelihood of being judgmental and prejudiced. 4. Challenge your biases: Everyone has unconscious biases based on their background, upbringing, and life experiences. To stop being judgmental and prejudiced, you must recognize and confront your biases. When you catch yourself making a judgment or assumption about someone, ask yourself why you think or feel that way and whether your judgment is based on fact or opinion. 5. Be open-minded: Be receptive to new ideas, perspectives, and experiences. Listen actively to opposing opinions and try to appreciate their point of view, even if you don't agree with it. By exposing yourself to different viewpoints and stepping out of your comfort zone, you can challenge your beliefs, broaden your horizons, and become less judgmental and prejudiced. 6. Surround yourself with diversity: Develop friendships and engage in social activities with people from various backgrounds. This exposure to diverse experiences and perspectives will not only enrich your worldview but also help you eliminate judgment and prejudice. 7. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. With increased self-awareness, you are better equipped to recognize when you are being judgmental, acknowledge your prejudice, and change your mindset. 8. Hold yourself accountable: Recognize that change takes time and effort, and you may encounter setbacks along the way. It's important to hold yourself accountable when you notice yourself displaying judgmental or prejudiced behavior. Reflect on your actions and take steps to rectify the situation, such as apologizing, or challenging yourself to change your thoughts and actions in future interactions. 9. Be kind and fair: Treat people with compassion, kindness, and fairness, regardless of their background. Adopt a respectful approach to engage in conversations with others, striving to understand their perspective before offering your own. By doing so, you are less likely to judge people and less likely to develop or display prejudice. In conclusion, to stop being judgmental and prejudiced, it is essential to understand the roots of your thinking, develop self-awareness, educate yourself, develop empathy, challenge your biases, be open-minded, surround yourself with diversity, practice mindfulness, hold yourself accountable, and be kind and fair towards others. It's an ongoing process, but with commitment and self-reflection, you can change your mindset and become a more accepting and compassionate person."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the context of a juice stand, the man could also be preparing fresh juice, which involves the blending of fruit, but doesn't necessarily result in a smoothie. The difference lies in the fact that smoothies typically have a thicker, more substantial texture than juices, often as a result of incorporating components like yogurt, milk, ice cream, or protein supplements. Juices, on the other hand, aim to extract the liquids and flavors from fruits and sometimes vegetables, often resulting in a thinner, more watery consistency than smoothies.

If \\"A little girl holding a camera.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The girl has a camera.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"The girl has a camera\\" if the statement is \\"A little girl holding a camera.\\" Let's analyze the given statement and the logical conclusion in more detail. The statement \\"A little girl holding a camera\\" provides us with two primary pieces of information: 1. There is a little girl. 2. This girl is holding a camera. By using the word \\"holding,\\" the statement tells us that the little girl has the camera in her possession, and she is physically carrying or grasping it. The act of holding something implies that the person or subject has control or ownership of the object, at least for the time being. Now, let's consider the conclusion statement: \\"The girl has a camera.\\" The word \\"has\\" signifies possession or ownership. In this context, having a camera means that the girl owns, possesses, or is in control of the camera. Comparing the initial statement with the conclusion, we can observe that the information provided in the conclusion matches the information given in the original statement. The conclusion specifies that the girl possesses or is in control of a camera, and since we know from the initial statement that the girl is holding the camera, it is reasonable to deduce that she has it. Therefore, it is logically valid to conclude that \\"The girl has a camera\\" when given the statement \\"A little girl holding a camera.\\" This conclusion accurately portrays the relationship between the little girl and the camera based on the information provided. While \\"holding\\" highlights the physical action of having a camera, \\"has\\" describes the possession, ownership, or control of the camera, all of which are true in this scenario."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan. She kept these little books after all the others had gone back. She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins.

Select from: + no; + yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"yes; the answer is correct. Johnnie felt like she was giving up part of herself when she finally decided to return the books to the office. This feeling was due to her deep connection with the volumes of English verse, which she had read and reread multiple times. The books had become intertwined with her own vocabulary, imagery, and thoughts, making them a significant part of her identity. Moreover, she had grown attached to Stoddard's annotations, which served as personal expressions and reminders of their relationship. The decision to return these cherished books was a painful one, signifying a loss of something dear to her. Consequently, when Johnnie prepared the package to take them back to the mill, she felt as though she was giving up a part of herself, demonstrating a profound emotional attachment to the books and the memories associated with them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What was the full name of the person who painted four lunette murals? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Pennsylvania State Capitol houses the chambers for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Capitol contains 475 rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine between the first and second floors, and a basement. The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. Mercer produced 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2) of tile, which includes \\"377 mosaics, representing 254 scenes, artifacts, animals, birds, fish, insects, industries and workers from Pennsylvania history\\". The interiors of the rotunda and the dome are inscribed with a quote from William Penn made upon the foundation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: There may be room there for such a holy experiment. For the nations want a precedent. And my God will make it the seed of a nation. That an example may be set up to the nations. That we may do the thing that is truly wise and just.

Unlike Game 1, Seattle's offense got off to a strong start, as RB Shaun Alexander got a 2-yard TD run, while QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 49-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson. That's how the rest of the first half would end up. In the third quarter, the score of the period was Arizona kicker Neil Rackers completed a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Seahawks got a 1-yard TD run by FB Mack Strong. The Cardinals would get a touchdown, which would come in the form of a 40-yard TD pass from QB Kurt Warner to WR Bryant Johnson, but fortunately, Seattle would maintain the lead for the win. The Seahawks would extend their home winning streak to 11 straight games and improved to 2-0.

To provide more context, Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan, also known as Renzong, was the fifth emperor of the Yuan dynasty in China, a ruling dynasty founded by the Mongolian ruler Kublai Khan. He was the son of Darmabala and Dagi (a descendant of the family of Genghis Khan) and the great-grandson of Kublai Khan. During his reign, Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan implemented several significant changes and reforms that had a considerable impact on the political landscape during his time. One such reform was the reinstatement of the imperial examinations for China's civil service, which had been abolished by Kublai Khan. The imperial examination was an essential element of traditional Chinese society, as it allowed individuals to obtain positions within the government based on their merit and knowledge, rather than their social status or connections. The imperial examinations were designed to assess a candidate's knowledge of the Confucian classics and their ability to write essays and poetry. This system ensured that those selected for government positions were well-versed in Chinese culture, ethics, and governance. Kublai Khan, as a Mongolian ruler, abolished the imperial examinations to consolidate his power and diminish the influence of the Chinese literati, who had dominated the imperial bureaucracy for centuries. During Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan's reign, a shift occurred in the Yuan dynasty's attitude towards Chinese culture, scholarship, and governance. He reinstated the imperial examinations to foster a more inclusive and merit-based system for selecting government officials, thereby recognizing the importance and value of Chinese intellectual traditions. In conclusion, the sentence provided does answer the question about when Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan reigned. His reign occurred between 1311 and 1320, during which he made several significant changes, such as the reinstatement of the imperial examinations, a practice previously abolished by Kublai Khan. This demonstrated his recognition and appreciation of the intellectual and scholarly traditions of China, which had lasting effects on the country's political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.

Both sentences are stating that \\"it\\" is available in specific areas, which are Phibsboro, Castleknock, Finglas, Cabra, and Ballymun. The difference between the two sentences is the presence of an additional comma and the absence of the word \\"and\\" before \\"Cabra\\" in the second sentence.

C++ (pronounced \\"cee plus plus\\" ) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM. C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as \\"ISO/IEC 14882:2014\\" (informally known as C++14). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as \\"ISO/IEC 14882:1998\\", which was then amended by the C++03, \\"ISO/IEC 14882:2003\\", standard. The current C++14 standard supersedes these and C++11, with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization. The C++17 standard is due in July 2017, with the draft largely implemented by some compilers already, and C++20 is the next planned standard thereafter. 1. What are the biggest strengths of C++? 2.

Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived. Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back. Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox.

The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family. It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital.

This skill can help you learn new music more rapidly and enhance your overall musicianship. Allocate a portion of your practice routine to sight-reading exercises. Step 8: Play with others Playing music with others provides valuable experience and allows for immediate feedback. Join a local orchestra, band, chamber group, or attend jam sessions to refine your ensemble skills and learn from other musicians. Step 9: Record yourself Recording your practice sessions can help you identify areas that need improvement. Listen back to your recordings critically, taking note of intonation, rhythm, tone quality, and other aspects of your playing. Step 10: Stay motivated and track progress Celebrate small victories and milestones, and don't be too hard on yourself when you encounter challenges. Keep a practice log or journal to document your progress, and consider sharing your journey with friends, family, or on social media for extra accountability and support. Step 11: Seek out performance opportunities Performing in front of an audience can build confidence and offer valuable experience. Seek out performance opportunities, like open mics, talent shows, recitals, or simply playing for friends and family. Step 12: Continue learning To maintain momentum and continuously improve as a musician, explore new techniques, styles, and repertoire. Attend workshops, take masterclasses, or pursue further education to expand your knowledge and skills. Learning a new instrument is a rewarding journey that requires time, effort, perseverance, and patience.

What religious term originally referring to the the most educated and literate officials and leaders within the church, evolved into a workplace title nowadays positioned at the other end of an organizational hierarchy?","completion":"The religious term that originally referred to the most educated and literate officials and leaders within the church but evolved into a workplace title nowadays positioned at the other end of an organizational hierarchy is \\"clerk.\\" The term \\"clerk\\" has its roots in the Latin word \\"clericus,\\" which referred to a clergyman or a cleric, and the Late Old English term \\"clerc,\\" which denoted a member of the clergy. In the medieval period, education and literacy were primarily accessible to those in religious institutions. As a result, clergymen were among the most educated and literate people in society. During the medieval era, the Catholic Church played a critical role in governance, so it was natural for clergymen to assume various administrative and leadership positions. They were responsible for numerous tasks ranging from recording events, managing financial transactions, tracking legal matters, and overseeing routine administrative functions. As we progressed into the late Middle Ages, literate laymen, mainly drawn from the emerging middle class, began to assume roles previously held by clergymen. This development was catalyzed by the expansion of secular schools, which churned out skilled scribes and administrators. Eventually, the term \\"clerk\\" began to lose its religious connotation and took on a more secular meaning. In the modern context, the term \\"clerk\\" is commonly used to describe individuals employed in administrative or support roles within various organizations, from businesses to governmental institutions. Rather than signifying an individual with exceptional education or authority, as it did in the past, the term is now often associated with entry-level or lower-level professionals in an organizational hierarchy. Nonetheless, the expertise and administrative duties hailing back to their connection with the church remain essential components of the clerk's core functions. In summary, the term \\"clerk\\" has evolved significantly over the centuries, transforming from its origins as a title for the highly educated and literate officials within the church to a workplace designation for individuals who perform routine administrative duties and occupy entry-level roles within an organization. This shift reflects both the changing influence of religious institutions over time and the broader development of secular education and the emergence of distinct professional classes."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war. Question: \\"Who was joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei in Singapore?\\" Answer: \\"The British\\" Is this answer correct?

One feat that often captivates the attention of fans and commentators alike is the field goal. Attempting to put points on the board from great distances is a rare showcase of skill, accuracy, and strength. Record-breaking field goals are etched into the annals of football history, and in this article, we'll answer the question, \\"Which player kicked the longest field goal?\\" Step 1: Provide Statistics and Player Background Matt Prater, a renowned placekicker, currently holds the record for the longest successful field goal attempt in NFL history. Born on August 10, 1984, Prater was drafted by the Detroit Lions in 2006 from the University of Central Florida. Over the years, he has played for the Miami Dolphins, Atlanta Falcons, Denver Broncos, and now the Detroit Lions once again. Through his illustrious career, Prater has consistently proven his reliability and prowess on the field. Step 2: Discuss the Record-Breaking Kick Prater set the record for the longest field goal on December 8, 2013, while playing for the Denver Broncos. In a game against the Tennessee Titans, this incredible 64-yard field goal not only demonstrated the tremendous skill of Prater but also aided the Broncos in securing a 51-28 victory. This record-breaking kick surpassed the previous record held by Tom Dempsey, a legendary kicker known for his uniquely squared-toe shoe. Dempsey's 63-yard feat, set in 1970 with the New Orleans Saints, had stood as the NFL's longest successful field goal attempt for 43 years before Prater's awe-inspiring kick shattered the milestone. Step 3: Explain the Factors that Contributed to the Achievement Several factors contributed to Prater's record-breaking kick, such as the altitude of the Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado. As the stadium is approximately 5,280 feet above sea level, the thinner air allows the ball to travel farther than it would in a lower altitude environment. Another significant factor in Prater's success was the support of his teammates – the holder, who carefully positioned the ball, and the offensive line, who made sure Prater had the time and space necessary to execute the kick with speed and precision. With their combined efforts, Prater was able to make history. Conclusion: The Legacy of Matt Prater's Longest Field Goal Matt Prater's record-breaking 64-yard field goal is a testament to his unparalleled skill, focus, and tenacity. As the longest field goal ever made in NFL history, this feat earns him an esteemed place amongst the greatest placekickers in the NFL. With superb capabilities, impeccable technique, and the support of his peers, it is no wonder that Prater was able to break this long-standing record and inspire future generations of kickers to strive for greatness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No While The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter does represent a notable example of a work that won both the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction, we cannot infer that these prestigious awards have never been awarded to the same author in one year simply based on this example alone. In fact, there have been instances in which both awards have gone to the same author for the same work in the same year. For example, in 1993, Annie Proulx's The Shipping News won both awards. Similarly, Richard Powers's The Overstory won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 2018.

For example, some spray bottles have adjustable nozzles which can be turned to control the spray from a fine mist to a more focused stream. 6. Hold the spraying device in one hand, positioning it with the nozzle facing away from you and towards the target area where you want to apply the spray. 7. With your other hand, grasp the trigger, lever, or button that controls the flow of the substance through the nozzle. This could be a squeeze-trigger on a spray bottle, a button or lever on a paint sprayer, or a pump action on a perfume atomizer. 8. Apply pressure to the trigger, lever, or button to release the substance in a spray or mist pattern towards the target area. Maintain a consistent pressure and a steady hand to ensure an even application of the substance. 9. Move the spraying device in a sweeping motion across the target surface or area, overlapping each pass slightly to ensure thorough coverage. Continue spraying until the desired coverage and effect are achieved. 10. Once you have finished spraying, release the trigger, lever, or button to stop the flow of the substance. Clean the nozzle or any parts of the spraying device that came into contact with the substance, as necessary, following the manufacturer's cleaning instructions. 11. Store the spraying device and any remaining substance according to the manufacturer's recommendations or specific safety guidelines for the substance being used."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"What was the goal of the partition?\\" Context: \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The goal of the partition was to create separate independent states for the Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority regions in British India, as the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League had differing visions for India's future. The partition aimed to address the concerns of the Muslim minority who feared domination by the Hindu majority in a unified secular Indian state. This led to the formation of India and Pakistan, with the intention to prevent civil unrest and potential civil war. Unfortunately, the partition also resulted in massive population displacement and violence between the two communities, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen, binominal name or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the \\"International Code of Zoological Nomenclature\\" (\\"ICZN\\") for animals and the \\"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\\" (\\"ICN\\"). Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In the Virginia woods, Mark Warner is trailed by Obamacare Updated 7:27 a.m. ET, 4/17/2014 Wakefield, Virginia (CNN) - Mark Warner was weaving his way through the crowd on a chilly Wednesday afternoon at the Shad Planking, the annual Virginia fish fry that brings beer-sipping politicos together in the tall pines of southeastern Virginia, when a burly man sporting an NRA sticker approached. “Senator, did you read the Affordable Care Act before you voted for it?” he asked. Warner, his brow furrowed earnestly, was prepared. “I’ve outlined a series of changes to it,” he said, gripping the man’s shoulder and jabbing his finger. “Five separate bills.” The Democrat moved along briskly, back-slapping longtime supporters but also facing down several more questions about the health care law he supported from hostile interrogators, most of them backing Republican Ed Gillespie, his likely challenger this year. CNN: Key races to watch in 2014 With his signature grin and rolled-up sleeves, Warner answered them all like the seasoned politician he is. But the specter of the Obamacare pecked at him throughout what was supposed to be a light-hearted afternoon of backwoods politicking and friendly bipartisan joshing. The drive into the 66th annual Shad Planking along Brittles Mill Road in Wakefield was dotted with hundreds of pro-Warner campaign signs. But they were overshadowed by a series of larger placards paid for by the Republican Party of Virginia. “Mark Warner Betrayed Virginia,” they read. “Obamacare’s Deciding Vote.” Warner has a big lead over the little-known Gillespie early polls, and the Republican still has to secure the Senate nomination at a convention in June. But inside the event, Gillespie supporters appeared to outnumber Warner backers by a wide margin. Gillespie had arrived earlier, trailed by staffers and a small horde of volunteers hoisting campaign signs. The first-time candidate, a veteran GOP fixer and lobbyist, worked his campaign booth, handing out beer and taking questions from reporters. “The problem with Sen. Warner is with his record,” Gillespie said. “The more Virginia learns about that record, they’ll be surprised because it’s also at odds with how Sen. Warner portrays himself back home. He is not the independent voice he portrays himself to be, voting 97% of the time President Obama and Harry Reid.” On his way out of the woods, Gillespie bumped into Warner, the first time the two have crossed paths as rival candidates. They chatted briefly about Terry McAuliffe, the new Virginia governor who chaired the Democratic National Committee a decade ago when Gillespie ran the Republican National Committee. Polls: Warner way ahead of Gillespie in Virginia Warner was booked as this year’s headline speaker. He was introduced by John Hager, a former GOP lieutenant governor, who heralded the event’s bipartisan conviviality. “Looks like there’s lots of good gettin’-together,” he chuckled as he surveyed the audience. It wasn’t always that way: The event was started by the segregationist Democrats who used to dominate politics in the commonwealth. Today, women and African-Americans are allowed to participate, but the Shad Planking retains a conservative bent. Wednesday’s vest-wearing crowd was mostly white and mostly male, part Garden and Gun, part Guns and Ammo. In keeping with the spirit of the day and his own political centrism, Warner avoided charged rhetoric in his brief talk on stage. A former governor and Democratic Party chairman, it was his fourth career appearance at the Shad Planking. He had warm words for the Republicans sitting next to him on stage, including George Allen, the former governor and senator who had a wad of tobacco stuffed into his lower lip. Warner declined to roast Gillespie, as speakers often do with their opponents here. His jokes were instead about Virginia’s shifting electoral landscape. “Of course, I know among this crowd I represent an endangered species – a Virginia Democrat,” Warner cracked. “Not unlike Republican women, our numbers here are few.” And then: “You know, they say the face of Virginia is changing. I have been coming to the Shad Planking for nearly 25 years, and as I look out over this crowd, the face of Virginia looks just about the same as it ever was. Just a little more wrinkled.” Complete coverage of the 2014 midterm elections His speech was peppered with feel-goody nods to “the Virginia way,” commonwealth shorthand for a genteel manner of across-the-aisle deal-making that “produces results.” The happy talk glossed over the grid-locked realities of do-nothing Washington and the ideological warfare unfolding in the state capital of Richmond, where a battle over Medicaid expansion could force a government shutdown. Warner huddled with the press after his speech. They wanted to know what elements of his Senate record he would feature in his campaign. He was quick to pivot back to his accomplishments as governor, mainly his landmark 2004 tax reform deal and successful efforts to boost Virginia’s business-friendly reputation. “What Virginians have always appreciated is people who get stuff done,” he said. But what about his Senate record? Warner talked about his “efforts” on issues like debt, infrastructure, immigration, housing and finance - but not health care. He referenced his work with bipartisan “gangs” in the Senate, where “being a gang member is a good thing.” He punted when asked if he would welcome President Barack Obama to campaign with him before November. “There will be time to talk about the campaign,” he said. “I have worked with the President, but there are areas where I disagree with the President.” As examples, Warner pointed to entitlement reform and energy policy, specifically his support for the Keystone XL Pipeline and offshore oil and gas drilling. “So that’s a maybe?” a reporter followed up. Warner was already moving on to shake the next hand.","completion":"Senator Mark Warner faced questions about his support for the Affordable Care Act from hostile interrogators during a gathering at the annual Virginia fish fry. Despite his lead over his Republican challenger Ed Gillespie in early polls, Gillespie supporters seemed to outnumber Warner's at the event.

David Bruce Vitter (born May 3, 1961) is an American lobbyist, lawyer and politician who served as United States Senator for Louisiana from 2005 to 2017. He was the first Republican elected to the Senate from his state since the Reconstruction Era. Previously, he served in the United States House of Representatives, representing the suburban Louisiana's 1st congressional district. He served as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives before entering the U.S. House. Vitter has been actively involved with legislation concerning illegal immigrants. In June 2007, he led a group of conservative Senators in blocking federal Immigration Legislation that would have granted a pathway to legal residence to 12 million illegal immigrants coupled with increased border enforcement. The bill's defeat won Vitter national attention as the bill was supported by President George W. Bush, John McCain, and Ted Kennedy, among others. Vitter characterized the bill as amnesty, which supporters denied. Bush accused the bill's opponents of fear mongering. In October 2007, Vitter introduced an amendment withholding Community Oriented Policing Services funds from any sanctuary city which bans city employees and police officers from asking people about their immigration status in violation of the Illegal Immigration Act. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, in opposition to the amendment, said these cities do not want to inquire about someone's status if they report a crime, are a victim of domestic violence or get vaccinations for their children. The amendment was defeated. In November 2007, Vitter introduced a bill requiring banks to verify that no customer was an illegal immigrant before issuing banking or credit cards. The bill never made it out of committee. In March 2008, Vitter reintroduced the latter two proposals and cosponsored ten of eleven other bills in a Republican package of tough immigration enforcement measures including jail time for illegal border crossing; deportation for any immigrant (legal or illegal) for a single driving while intoxicated; declaration of English as the official language (thereby terminating language assistance at voting booths and federal agencies)' additional construction of a border fence; permission for local and state police to enforce immigration laws and penalties for states who issue drivers licenses to illegals. None of these proposals passed, partially because the Democratic-controlled Senate preferred a comprehensive approach which would include a guest-worker program and a path to citizenship for the current population more akin to the package defeated by Vitter in 2007. In April 2008, Vitter introduced a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that a child born in the United States is not a citizen unless a parent is a citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien serving in the military. Currently the Constitution grants citizenship to children born within the U.S. regardless of the legal status of the parents. The bill never made it out of the Democratic-led committee.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... Dan is a geneticist and studied two villages from 2,000 years ago. Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. Which village displayed an observable Allee effect? Answer:","completion":"Village B displayed an observable Allee effect. The Allee effect refers to a decline in individual fitness within a species due to a decrease in population size and a subsequent reduction in genetic diversity. In the case of the two villages studied by the geneticist Dan, Village A had a large population that grew larger over time, which would result in a relatively stable and diverse gene pool. Consequently, there would be a lower likelihood of an Allee effect occurring in Village A. On the other hand, Village B had a small and declining population, and was geographically isolated. These factors would contribute to a reduction in genetic diversity due to a limited gene pool size and a higher likelihood of inbreeding. Genetic bottleneck, which can result from a shrinking population, can lead to an accumulation of deleterious mutations due to genetic drift. Smaller gene pools are also more susceptible to stochastic events where harmful alleles become fixed, reducing the overall fitness of individuals within the population. Mildly deleterious alleles that are less likely to be removed by natural selection, and beneficial mutations with a higher chance of being lost by random chance, could also be more prevalent in smaller gene pools like that of Village B. Considering these factors, it is more likely that Village B displayed an observable Allee effect due to its small and declining population, leading to a decrease in individual fitness within the species and a higher propensity for genetic issues as a result of reduced genetic diversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Water flows into the dishwasher - The dishwasher heats the water - The detergent dispenser opens at the right time - Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes - The dirty water is drained - More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes - The water is drained again - The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The water is cold happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis states that if the water is cold, it will help the dishwasher clean better. To analyze the effect of this perturbation on the dishwasher's cleaning process, let's break down the process step by step and examine the consequences of using cold water instead of hot water. 1. Water flows into the dishwasher: Cold water enters the dishwasher instead of hot water. This can lower the overall temperature inside the dishwasher during the cleaning cycle. 2. The dishwasher heats the water: In response to the cold water introduced, the dishwasher will need to expend more energy and take more time to heat the water to the desired temperature. This could lead to increased energy consumption and longer wash cycles. 3. The detergent dispenser opens at the right time: Cold water can hinder the effectiveness of some detergents, as they may not dissolve and activate optimally in cooler temperatures. This can result in a less effective cleaning process as the detergent will not be able to break down food residues and stains as efficiently. 4. Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes: Cold water doesn't have the same grease-cutting and stain-removing properties as hot water. Consequently, the cleaning power of the dishwasher may be reduced, requiring more energy, more detergent, or additional wash cycles to achieve the desired level of cleanliness. 5. The dirty water is drained: Since the water may not have cleaned the dishes as effectively, the drained water may still contain food particles, grease, and detergent residues. This could cause blockages or malodorous conditions in the dishwasher. 6. More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes: If cold water is used for rinsing, it may not be as effective in removing detergent residues and cleaning agents from the dishes. This could leave a film or spots on the dishes after they have been dried. 7. The water is drained again: Similar to the previous draining step, the residual detergent and food particles might not be effectively removed, causing potential clogging issues and undesirable odors. 8. The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes: Since the dishwasher may need to expend more energy to heat the cold water, the overall energy consumption during the drying process may also increase, making the drying less efficient. In summary, the supposed perturbation of using cold water in the dishwasher cleaning process has both direct and indirect effects on the effectiveness and efficiency of the process. Cold water can hinder detergent activation, reduce the cleaning power of the water, and increase energy consumption and cycle times. Consequently, the perturbation hypothesis does not support the claim that using cold water would help the dishwasher clean better. Instead, it would likely reduce the overall cleaning performance and efficiency of the dishwasher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Interior Ministry said it had deployed almost 10,000 police and 48 dogs to track down the fugitive leader of the Sinaloa cartel. Mexico is also co-operating with neighbouring Guatemala and the United States to increase border controls. Guzman's escape from a top-security jail through a 1.5km-long tunnel is a major embarrassment for officials. It is the second time the drug cartel leader has escaped from a top-security Mexican jail. Should drug lord Guzman have been extradited to the US? More than 100 roadblocks have been set up on highways across Mexico and 100,000 leaflets with mug shots of Guzman have been distributed at toll booths. Airports have been put on alert and security personnel have been told to search any private flights taking off. Police are also searching hotels and hospitals for any trace of Guzman. The government is offering a 60m peso (3.8m; Â£2.4m) reward for information leading to his capture. On Wednesday, Mexican officials said they were also co-operating with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the FBI. The DEA reportedly played a key role in Guzman's 2014 re-capture, providing intelligence which led Mexican security forces to the apartment where he was hiding, in his native Sinaloa state in north-western Mexico. The Mexican interior minister has also held meetings with Guatemalan officials to prevent Guzman slipping into the neighbouring country. In 1993, Guzman was arrested just south of Mexico's border with Guatemala. Saturday was the second time Guzman managed to escape from a maximum-security jail. In 2001 he broke out of Puente Grande prison, reportedly hiding in a laundry cart. He was on the run for 13 years before being re-arrested in February last year. The scale of the tunnel through which he fled on Saturday raised suspicions that he had help from prison staff. Three senior prison officials, including the director of the jail, have been dismissed. The escape tunnel, which leads to a building outside the prison perimeter, is more than 1.5km (1 mile) long and measures 1.70m (5ft 6in) in height. Security officials said it could have taken a year to build. On Wednesday, prison officials allowed journalists to inspect the cell from which he fled. Each journalist was only given two minutes inside the cell. One-hundred-and-twenty seconds are enough to raise questions about how this escape was possible. How could it be that no one heard or saw anything? Inside the cell suspicion mounts that you don't get out of here without accomplices on the inside. Underneath the shower is the hole where the tunnel starts, but it's so deep and dark you can't really see anything. At two sides of the hole are 1.2m-high walls which were meant to shield Guzman's privacy while he was showering. The security camera could not see past these walls and it was behind them that the man who is now being sought by thousands of police escaped. The Sinaloa cartel, which Guzman leads, is one of Mexico's most powerful drug gangs, responsible for smuggling huge quantities of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines to the United States. Following his escape, the Chicago Crime Commission has again declared Guzman \\"Public Enemy Number One\\".

A house guest is facing felony charges after he allegedly killed a friend's dog by putting the canine in a sweltering oven. Joel Clark, 37, was being held on Thursday at the Marion County Jail in Indiana. He faces charges of killing a domestic animal and torturing or mutilating a vertebrate animal, according to new court documents. Prosecutors said Clark was on house arrest and living with two friends, Christina Kelley and Richard Smith at the time. Miss Kelley found Zane, a Miniature Pinscher, dead on May 18. The little dog was discovered in the bottom of a trash can. The woman was then horrified to discover dog hair and a toenail on a cookie sheet and pizza pan in the oven, court documents said. A necropsy found that the dog's whiskers were burned, it had burn marks on its legs and feet and blood on its snout and mouth. Court documents said Clark told one of the friends that he had killed the dog about 30 minutes before its body was discovered, but they did not believe him. The dog's owners had no idea of Clark's motive. He also told one of the friends that he 'could take care of that dog, too' when a pitbull walked past them, the documents said. The friends ordered Clark to leave their home after they found Zane dead, court documents said. Miss Kelley and Mr Smith said that they were aghast by the death of their pet and totally bewildered because no argument had taken place before the brutal killing, according to the Indy Star.

Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that the tribes of Israel were scattered to roam the world as the Ten Lost Tribes. This implies that they left their original location and dispersed to different parts of the world. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that the tribes of Israel stayed where they were and nothing ever changed. This suggests that they remained in their original location and did not disperse. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis The two statements are contradictory. The premise says the tribes dispersed, while the hypothesis says they remained in place. Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the statements The premise and hypothesis are mutually exclusive; they cannot both be true at the same time. If the premise is true, the tribes dispersed, and the hypothesis, which states they stayed, must be false.

Q: The facade of Saint Denis resembled what other well known structure? A: The rose window is the earliest-known example above the West portal in France. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"No, the response does not correctly address the question, which asks about the overall resemblance of the façade of Saint Denis. Instead of naming another known structure, the response describes a specific architectural feature of the Saint Denis. Allow me to provide a detailed and correct response: The Basilica of Saint-Denis, a large medieval abbey church in the city of Saint-Denis, just north of Paris, is known as one of the first structures built in the style of Gothic architecture. The Basilica's façade, with its architectural elements and layout, resembles the façade of the western front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris; hence, these two buildings are often compared. The façade of Saint Denis heavily influenced the design of other Gothic cathedrals and structures. It features two massive towers, abundant carved ornamentation, and a large, central rose window that became iconic elements of Gothic church facades, just like Notre Dame's west front. Both façades share several architectural features typical of the Gothic style, like portals decorated with detailed sculptural compositions, large windows, and verticality that draws the eye upwards towards the heavens. The comparison between the façade of Saint Denis and the façade of Notre Dame serves to pinpoint the proliferation and influence of the early Gothic style that originated in the Ile-de-France region, bearing witness to the architectural evolution that occurred during the Middle Ages. Despite some differences due to the different construction periods and architectural advancements, the resemblance in their structure and design elements link these two iconic buildings and indicate Saint Denis's significant influence on the Gothic architectural style development. In summary, the façade of Saint Denis is often compared with well-known structures built in the early Gothic style, such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, due to their characteristic architectural features and the influential role Saint Denis had in the evolution and spread of this style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Combine facts and answer this: Are both Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay both writers? A:","completion":"Yes, both Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay can be categorized as writers, although they possess different writing styles, subject matter, and cultural backgrounds. Let's take a closer look at each of these writers, their accomplishments, and how they made their mark on the literary world. Julio Cortázar (1914-1984) was an Argentine writer who was a key figure in the Latin American \\"Boom\\" literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Born in Brussels, Belgium, but raised in Argentina, Cortázar is best known for his novels and short stories, which often combine elements of both traditional realism and the literary avant-garde. Cortázar's work displays an intense sensitivity to language, a keen awareness of structural possibilities within different genres, and a tendency to play with the reader's expectations and assumptions. His works include the novels \\"Hopscotch\\" (1963), \\"62: A Model Kit\\" (1968), and \\"A Manual for Manuel\\" (1973), as well as numerous collections of short stories, such as \\"Bestiary\\" (1951), \\"Final Exam\\" (1950), and \\"Cronopios and Famas\\" (1962). Cortázar is well-known for his experimental, non-linear narratives, sometimes utilizing unconventional methods of storytelling, such as allowing the reader to rearrange the order of his novel \\"Hopscotch\\" in a choose-your-own-path style. Norman Lindsay (1879-1969) was an Australian artist, poet, writer, and etcher. Born in Creswick, Victoria, Lindsay enjoyed a varied creative career, achieving success in several fields. As a writer, he is best known for his novels and children's books. His literary work often features themes of romance and modernity, typically centering on the tensions between individualism and social conformity, with a sprinkling of humor and satire. He was also a talented artist and became controversial for his erotic depictions of the female form. Lindsay's most notable literary contributions include the novels \\"A Curate in Bohemia\\" (1913), \\"Redheap\\" (1930), and \\"The Cautious Amorist\\" (1931), as well as his children's book, \\"The Magic Pudding\\" (1918), which has become a classic of Australian children's literature. Despite facing censorship challenges in his lifetime, Lindsay's works have continued to be celebrated and enjoyed by many readers. In conclusion, both Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay were writers who made significant contributions to the literary world. While hailing from different cultural backgrounds and focusing on distinct genres, themes, and writing styles, they shared a mutual passion for the written word, leaving a lasting impact on literature and inspiring future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard.

He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge.

After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \\"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\\". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits.

Her father was an itinerant preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist. Alongside Franklin, her parents had three other children while both C. L. and Barbara had children from outside their marriage. The family relocated to Buffalo, New York when Franklin was two. In November 1966, choosing not to renew her Columbia contract after six years with the company, Franklin signed to Atlantic Records. In January 1967, she traveled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama to record at FAME Studios to record the song, \\"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\\" in front of the musicians of the famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. The song was later issued that February and shot up to number-one on the R&B chart, while also peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Franklin her first top ten pop single. The song's b-side, \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\", reached the R&B top 40, peaking at number 37. In April, Atlantic issued her frenetic version of Otis Redding's \\"Respect\\", which shot to number-one on both the R&B and pop charts and later became her signature song and was later hailed as a civil rights and feminist anthem. Franklin's debut Atlantic album, I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, also became commercially successful, later going gold. Franklin scored two more top ten singles in 1967 including \\"Baby I Love You\\" and \\"(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman\\". Franklin's rapport with producer Jerry Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of Franklin's peak recordings with Atlantic. In 1968, she issued the top-selling albums, Lady Soul and Aretha Now, which included some of Franklin's most popular hit singles including \\"Chain of Fools\\", \\"Ain't No Way\\", \\"Think\\" and \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\". In February 1968, Franklin earned the first two of her Grammys including the debut category for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. On February 16, 1968, Franklin was honored with a day in her honor and was greeted by longtime friend Martin Luther King, Jr. who gave her the SCLC Drum Beat Award for Musicians just two months before his death. In June 1968, she appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Franklin's success expanded during the early 1970s in which she recorded top ten singles such as \\"Spanish Harlem\\", \\"Rock Steady\\" and \\"Day Dreaming\\" as well as the acclaimed albums, Spirit in the Dark, Young, Gifted & Black and her gospel album, Amazing Grace, which sold over two million copies. In 1971, Franklin became the first R&B performer to headline Fillmore West, later recording the live album, Aretha Live at Fillmore West. Franklin's career began to experience problems while recording the album, Hey Now Hey, which featured production from Quincy Jones. Despite the success of the single, \\"Angel\\", the album bombed upon its release in 1973. Franklin continued having R&B success with songs such as \\"Until You Come Back to Me\\" and \\"I'm in Love\\" but by 1975, her albums and songs were no longer top sellers. After Jerry Wexler left Atlantic for Warner Bros. Records in 1976, Franklin worked on the soundtrack to the film, \\"Sparkle\\", with Curtis Mayfield. The album yielded Franklin's final top 40 hit of the decade, \\"Something He Can Feel\\", which also peaked at number-one on the R&B chart. Franklin's follow-up albums for Atlantic including Sweet Passion, Almighty Fire and La Diva bombed on the charts and in 1979, Franklin opted to leave the company.

Help as much as you can. One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

It smashes into the couple's car, with them still in it, on a hillside beside the lookout over Fawcett City. It's revealed that that meteor is in fact Black Adam returning to Earth from his long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a seemingly rundown slum with very little food and rats for pets. He rises from his bed wearing a fan t-shirt bearing the Superman crest. He goes to his kitchen to find food, but only finds potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to rendezvous with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees three bullies robbing a homeless man. After attempting to defend the homeless man, Billy himself earns a black eye for his trouble. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, and calls him \\"The Captain\\". Billy responds by telling him he always try to do the right thing.

Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls. He emerges from beneath the rubble and transforms himself into Superman. Adam stalks young Billy through the streets stating his surprise over the Wizard's choice to become the next Marvel, but Billy is completely unaware of what he means.

All of this had already been cleared with all family members, however, I found out earlier this morning that for the past two days my mother and sister had been lying to my face (we talked about me staying at an Airbnb with my friends, they said it was a good idea) and my brother was not ok with my friends coming to town, or so my sister told me. There were maybe 60 some hours until my friends were supposed to leave, so I immediately messaged them and told them the truth, stating that my family did not want them to come (I’m not gonna lie about the reason when I have to cancel a trip on them last minute). I also made arrangements to, instead of going with my family, return home for the holidays. When I informed my sister of my plan, she accused me of using her and my brother, defended herself, and didn’t apologize for lying to me or any of the sort. Now, I’m finding out, maybe 3 hours after this all went down, that she meant they weren’t welcome at the apartment, but miscommunicated that to me by saying generally they weren’t welcome to come. My family is asking me to remake the plans with my friends and come to Denver anyways, but after all of this, I just want to go back home and take a break from them. I understand they’re my family and I love them, and I understand my mom not wanting to tell me the news on Christmas (worrying that it would ruin the holiday), but I just can’t handle the fact that they were okay with lying to my face to “preserve the holiday,” and potentially leaving me on the line to foot a several hundred dollar Airbnb bill from my friends (luckily they hadn’t booked yet).

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath. Story: Marco is sitting at the bottom of a mountain and painting a picture of it. Lauren, Marco's friend, is sitting about halfway up the mountain and painting a picture of the horizon.

Katrin, unnerved by Jack's actions, retreats to her house, but soon rejoins him to observe local dancers performing at a Buddhist festival. Stimulated by the dancing and the atmosphere of a Buddhist temple, Jack confesses his love to Katrin, and Katrin admits that she is not in love with Walter. At home, Katrin then treats Walter coolly and reveals that his chronic lateness and fatigue annoy her. To make amends, Walter comes home early the next day, but discovers Katrin's bedroom door locked and Jack's hat on a table. That evening, Walter confronts Katrin with his suspicions, and she admits that she loves Jack. Distraught, Walter tells Katrin that he will grant her a divorce only if Jack promises in writing that he will divorce his wife and marry her.

In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in.

In recent weeks, torrential rains have swept across several countries, resulting in the deaths of over 100 people and causing widespread panic throughout the region. Step 1: Describe the affected countries and their situations. Nepal, India, and Bangladesh are among the hardest-hit countries in the South Asian monsoon disaster. In Nepal, more than 50 people have been reported dead, scores are injured, and many residents are displaced due to the flooding and landslides. India, on the other hand, has seen a sharp increase in water levels in many parts of the country, particularly in the states of Assam and Bihar. In Bangladesh, the floods have killed at least 17 people, forcing around a million people to seek shelter in camps. Step 2: Mention the effects on infrastructure and housing. Source: ShutterstockMonsoon floods have led to severe infrastructural and housing damage in affected areas, as water levels have risen, inundating roads, bridges, and homes. Many residents in these areas are now without access to electricity, clean water, and essential services. As a result, people are forced to navigate the rising waters without proper support or resources, exacerbating the crisis. Step 3: Explain the relief efforts and potential challenges. Governments and humanitarian organizations, such as the Red Cross, have been mobilizing to provide relief to affected populations. The Indian government has deployed personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to evacuate those stranded in flood-affected areas, while the Nepalese and Bangladeshi authorities are working alongside UNICEF and other non-governmental organizations to supply assistance to their citizens. However, these efforts face significant challenges. The continuous rain has made transportation and distribution of aid quite difficult, while the ongoing threat of landslides in Nepal and the potential for waterborne diseases pose additional risks. The COVID-19 pandemic adds an extra layer of complexity to relief measures, as crowded shelters and supply distribution points complicate social distancing guidelines and risk sparking infection outbreaks. Step 4: Address the potential long-term effects on the region. The monsoon floods' long-lasting effects on the South Asian region are cause for concern. Food insecurity could become more widespread as farmlands are submerged and crop yields are diminished. Furthermore, the disrupted transportation systems and damaged infrastructure may hamper economic recovery efforts, particularly for those who rely on tourism and local trade for their livelihoods. Conclusion: The recent monsoon floods in South Asia have emphasized the need for a robust disaster response system in the region, including early warning systems, infrastructure planning, and investment in climate resilience. With the tragic loss of life and significant disruptions in affected countries, it's crucial that long-term solutions are devised to address the challenges posed by the monsoon season and prevent future catastrophes of such magnitude."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What areas were used to add to the city?\\" Context: \\"Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The areas used to add to the city during the reign of Napoleon III and under the direction of Georges-Eugène Haussmann can be broadly categorized into three main domains: expansion of existing infrastructure, annexation of surrounding towns, and creation of new urban spaces. 1. Expansion of existing infrastructure: One of the primary goals of Napoleon III and Haussmann's urban renewal project was to modernize and expand Paris's existing infrastructure to accommodate the rapidly growing population. This included the construction of wide, new boulevards, which were not only intended to facilitate transportation but also had the added purpose of allowing better control over crowds and preventing barricade-building during uprisings. The most famous of these boulevards is the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, which was extended westward to connect the heart of Paris with the newly created Bois de Boulogne. 2. Annexation of surrounding towns: In order to expand Paris to its current limits and better integrate the city with the surrounding metropolitan area, Napoleon III annexed several neighboring towns and villages in 1860. These newly incorporated areas were organized into eight new arrondissements, numbered from the 12th to the 20th. The annexed territories include: - Auteuil and Passy, which became part of the 16th arrondissement; - Batignolles and Monceau, which became part of the 17th arrondissement; - Montmartre, La Chapelle, and Clignancourt, which became part of the 18th arrondissement; - Belleville and Ménilmontant, which became part of the 19th arrondissement; - Charonne, Bercy, and La Villette, which became part of the 20th arrondissement. 3. Creation of new urban spaces: Napoleon III and Haussmann's project aimed not only to expand the city's existing infrastructure but also to create new, grand urban spaces that would serve as hubs for culture, commerce, and leisure. A multitude of new structures and public spaces were constructed during this period, including: - The Palais Garnier (also known as the Opéra de Paris), a neoclassical masterpiece that served as the city's principal opera house; - Les Halles, a central market and commercial hub that was designed to anchor the city's food supply network; - Numerous parks and gardens, including the Bois de Boulogne, a vast public park to the west of Paris, and the Bois de Vincennes, a sprawling forest and parkland to the east. These green spaces provided recreational opportunities and improved the overall quality of life for Parisians. In summary, the areas used to add to the city of Paris during the tenure of Napoleon III and Haussmann included the expansion of existing infrastructure, the annexation of surrounding towns, and the creation of new civic spaces. This extensive and ambitious public works project transformed the urban landscape of Paris, forming the foundation of the city as we know it today."},{"prompt":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Ummm, sounds like a copy cat Review: The clips that I've heard sound like nothing more than an unoriginal, copy-cat artist.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which group had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells? Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\" According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"In what state can women not obtain child support if they are not legally divorced?\\" is \\"California\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"In what state can women not obtain child support if they are not legally divorced?\\" is \\"Texas\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: This article: The story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez and Mia Samonte. The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat. One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride. Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice. Mia left for Malaysia. Two years after, when Allan finally broke free from his indecision, he went to Malaysia to look for Mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy. It was now Mia's turn to make a choice. She chose the new guy who loved her so much and the one she knew could help her support her family. Even though she honestly knew in her heart that she still loved Allan. Allan did not lose hope. He patiently waited for Mia for another three years. He firmly believed that she would come back to him as predicted by the old man earlier in the story. True enough, the Malaysian guy let Mia go as he was aware of who Mia truly wanted and her intention of choosing him over Allan.

Question: Where does this conversation most probably take place? - At a restaurant - In a fish shop - At a clinic The answer is:","completion":"At a restaurant. The conversation most probably takes place at a restaurant for several reasons. First, the context suggests a setting where food is being served or offered to customers, as the woman (W) is making a recommendation about a seafood dish with a special sauce. This is typical of a restaurant or dining establishment where staff members might help customers make menu choices based on their preferences or dietary restrictions. Furthermore, the presence of \\"sir\\" in the conversation indicates a level of formality that is likely to be found in a restaurant setting, where staff generally address customers politely and respectfully. Additionally, the man (M) responds to the recommendation by stating his allergy to shellfish, suggesting that he is a customer considering his meal options. While a fish shop may also sell seafood, the act of making a recommendation and discussing dietary restrictions is more commonly associated with a restaurant where the food would be prepared and consumed on-site. Finally, at a clinic, it would be highly unlikely for a staff member to recommend a seafood dish, as the primary focus in healthcare centers is on medical treatment and advice rather than food service."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.

Don't fight with your sisters or brothers, help with chores like cleaning the house, and be nice to your friends and teachers. If your parents see that you're a good boy, they might think that you can handle having longer hair. 2.

If you can show your parents that you'll take good care of your hair, they might not worry about it getting messy or dirty. 3. Talk to them about why you want long hair: Sometimes, just having a calm conversation with your parents can make a difference. Tell them why you want to grow your hair longer.

Dagonet A:","completion":"Title: The Icy Veil of Fate Genre: Mystery, Thriller, Drama Plot: Act 1: Introducing the Characters Thomas Dagonet, a middle-aged history professor, learns about a medieval manuscript from ancient Europe that is rumored to hold the key to supernatural powers. Thomas, a staunch skeptic of the supernatural, embarks on a mission to debunk the myth and prove that the manuscript holds nothing but historical and cultural insights. Accompanying Thomas on this journey is his daughter Emma, a young and ambitious journalist, and Jack, a former marine and an expert in survival skills. Unbeknownst to Thomas, his ex-wife Celeste, a powerful corporate executive, hires Jack to protect him during the expedition, fearing that her mysterious adversaries are after the manuscript for sinister purposes. Act 2: The Quest for the Manuscript Driven by their shared sense of adventure, the trio follows a series of clues that lead them to a remote wintry village in the Alps. As they discover more about the manuscript's history, they become increasingly intrigued by the supernatural legends, which seem to be rooted deeply in locals' lives. The villagers warn Thomas and his companions about a giant enchanted ice wall in the mountains, which supposedly houses the entrance to the secret world. As they ascend into the mountains, the devastating weather conditions force them to take shelter in the only available cabin. Act 3: Breaking the Ice and Confronting the Mysterious Adversaries When a sudden avalanche traps the trio in the cabin, Thomas, driven by his desire to disprove the legends, decides to break the ice wall outside the cabin with an axe. The act brings disastrous consequences, as the ice seems to cast a curse on him, causing his body to weaken and start freezing over. Meanwhile, Celeste's enigmatic adversaries reveal themselves as members of an ancient and dark order. Desperate to save Thomas, Jack and Emma lead the charge against them. As the battle unfolds, Thomas, on the brink of death, has a vision of a mysterious woman who reveals that the manuscript's true power lies in the hands of the believer. Act 4: The Power of Love and Belief Embracing the power within, Emma and Jack manage to fight off the adversaries and recover the manuscript. With his dying breath, Thomas confesses to his daughter that he now believes her mother was right about the supernatural. Emma, realizing that the bond of love and belief is the key to unleashing the manuscript's power, channels her energy to save her father. As Thomas comes back to life and the ice curse loses its grip, the trio returns to the village with a renewed sense of wonder and purpose. Together, they continue to explore the mysteries of the ancient world, humbled by the knowledge that the power of love and belief is the ultimate force. \\"The Icy Veil of Fate\\" is an action-packed, thrilling, and emotional journey that reminds the audience of the power of love, the importance of believing in something greater, and the strength of the human spirit when faced with supernatural forces."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Mesa, Arizona. (Reuters) In the news lull before much of America takes off for Christmas, Donald Trump's use of the word \\"schlonged\\" to describe Hillary Clinton's 2008 primary loss seized the public's imagination — or, according to our analysis of Google data, the imagination of that dismal subsection of the public that cares about politics. The subtext of it all was that the term appeared to be a crass reference to the male anatomy. Or was it, as Trump suggested on his personal newswire (Twitter) on Tuesday night, just a term for losing an election badly? For those on TV defending my use of the word \\"schlonged,\\" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2015 Trump also retweeted political analyst Jeff Greenfield's defense of the term, in which Greenfield declared that the term is \\"a commonplace NY way of saying: 'I lost big time.'\\" On further review, Trump is right on this. \\"I got schlonged\\" is a commonplace NY way of saying: \\"I lost big time,\\" w/out genital reference. — Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) December 23, 2015 To be perfectly clear, the expression is by no means \\"commonplace\\" — in New York or elsewhere. It has never appeared in the New York Times (prior to this week) and does not appear to have been used in any New York paper early in the 20th century. It doesn't appear in Irving Lewis Allen's 1993 book, \\"The City in Slang,\\" which documents any number of lesser-known expressions that trickled out of New York City. And, as a point of personal privilege, it's not something that I'm familiar with, having grown up upstate and lived in the city for most of the past decade. But it has popped up a few times, as The Post's Justin Moyer reported on Tuesday, including one usage in the exact same context — and in an interview with The Fix's very own Chris Cillizza. In March of 2011, Cillizza was interviewed by NPR's Neil Conan to discuss the then-recent death of 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro. Conan, who was born in Beirut but grew up in New York City, used the expression to describe the outcome of that race, which Ferraro and Walter Mondale lost overwhelmingly. CONAN: Chris Cillizza, that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls, but that's a historic moment. CILLIZZA: Absolutely historic moment, Neal, but as you point out, lost 49 states. The only state that that ticket won, which was led by Walter Mondale, was his home state of Minnesota. A veritable schlonging. (The word didn't impress itself upon Cillizza at the time, he said over email Tuesday evening, nor does it seem to have fazed him during the interview.) There are other examples, pointed out by linguist Ben Zimmer in an article at Politico. He also notes that Google's index of books turns up some examples, such as from \\"Welcome, Sinner\\" by Richard Posner, published in 1974. Slang like \\"schlonged\\" wouldn't normally crop up in written journalism, of course. That it appears in a radio broadcast, where editing is trickier, isn't really a surprise. Conan, like Trump, is in his late 60s, suggesting that there may be a generational aspect to its use. Lots of words that were common and unremarkable decades ago are now viewed as disrespectful or inappropriate, of course, but Trump, it seems, might well be right. We have to point out how Cillizza's remarks in that 2011 \\"Talk of the Nation\\" segment end. He compares Ferraro's uniqueness as a candidate to another candidate who gave it a shot only three years before Chris was speaking. \\"[G]roundbreaking in its way,\\" Cllizza said, \\"but one fascinating tidbit: We still don't have a woman president, and we had a female, obviously, nominee, with Hillary Clinton, and she lost the nomination.\\" She got beaten very badly, in fact. If I were a few decades older, there's a term I might use. This post has been updated with the additions from Zimmer. ||||| Nearly 24 hours after he said that Hillary Clinton had been \\"schlonged\\" by Barack Obama during her failed 2008 presidential campaign, Donald Trump took to Twitter to defend his comments.

Instead, he argued, he meant \\"beaten badly.\\" Once again, #MSM is dishonest. \\"Schlonged\\" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got \\"schlonged\\" that meant beaten badly. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2015 Trump went on to defend his comments, saying that NPR's Neal Conan had once used the phrase to refer to the trouncing at the polls that the Walter Mondale-Geraldine Ferraro presidential ticket received in the 1984 election. NPR's @NealConan said \\"schlonged\\" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: \\"That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls.\\" #Hypocrisy — Donald J.

He then read a verbatim version of Trump's \\"Don’t say it, it’s disgusting\\" take on Clinton's bathroom break during Saturday's Democratic presidential debate in Manchester, New Hampshire. \\"He must have a very unusual relationship with women,\\" Sanders said. He noted that he too took a pit stop at the debate. \\"I also went to the bathroom,\\" he said. \\"I've got to admit it.\\" Sanders noted that his trip didn't get Trump's attention. ||||| Bernie Sanders speaks during a Democratic presidential debate on Saturday in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Jim Cole) COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa — Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders ratcheted up his criticism Tuesday of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, calling him a “coward billionaire” and mocking him for talking about Hillary Clinton’s trip to the restroom during the past presidential debate. “He has discovered that women go to the bathroom, and it’s been very upsetting to him,” the senator from Vermont said of the real-estate mogul during a rally here that drew about 1,800 people. “This is a guy who wants to be president of the United States. He must have a very unusual relationship with women.” Sanders was referring to Trump’s recounting Monday of Clinton’s late return to the Democratic debate stage following a commercial break Saturday night. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump remarked on Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton's brief absence from the debate stage on Dec. 19 saying, \\"Where did she go? I thought she quit.\\" (Reuters) \\"I know where she went — it's disgusting, I don't want to talk about it,\\" Trump told a crowd in Grand Rapids, Mich. \\"No, it's too disgusting. Don't say it, it's disgusting.\\" [Donald Trump says Clinton’s bathroom break during the debate is ‘too disgusting’ to talk about] Sanders shared with his audience that “I was there at that debate that happened Saturday night” in Manchester, N.H. “Now I’ve got to be honest with you. I’ve got to be honest with you,” Sanders said, speaking in a mocking tone. “I also went to the bathroom. I know, I have to admit it. … This is the pathology. This is the guy who is leading in the Republican polls.” Earlier in his hour-long remarks, Sanders also took aim at Trump for his hard-line position on immigration and his recent proposal to ban all Muslims temporarily from coming into the country. Sanders also lambasted Trump for his objection to raising the minimum wage and his advocacy of tax breaks for high-income earners. [Clinton, Sanders both say the other might raise more money. So please help. And soon.] “You try to divide the American people up, you try to get us to hate Mexicans, to hate Muslims,” Sanders said. “You keep the minimum wage low and you give huge tax breaks to millionaires. Mr. Trump, that is not what makes America great.” Sanders’s appearance here came on the second day of a three-day swing through Iowa, the nation’s first caucus state. The state is key to Sanders’s fate. He has been leading in polls in New Hampshire, the second nominating state, but he has been trailing Clinton, former secretary of state, in Iowa. Sanders plans to return to Iowa next week for another three-day swing. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the usage of the term \\"schlonged\\" by Donald Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, to describe Hillary Clinton's 2008 primary loss.

Western populations are killed by diet-related scourges such as heart disease and cancer, while the use of supplements for preventive purposes is officially frowned upon. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the apparent dysfunction and inadequacy of many aspects of modern society, particularly in relation to healthcare and dietary practices. This issue is manifesting itself in multiple ways, leading to a variety of negative consequences for both individuals and entire populations. Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the significant role that diet plays in the overall health of a population. As it stands, a considerable number of Western cultures are plagued by an abundance of unhealthy food options, which are often heavily processed and filled with harmful ingredients. These diets, which are typically high in saturated fats, sugars, and cholesterol, have been shown to contribute to a wide range of ailments, including heart disease and cancer. As a result, countless lives are lost each year due to the prevalence of these diet-related issues. At the same time, there has been a noticeable pushback against the use of supplements and alternative methods of healthcare for the purpose of prevention. For various reasons, from skepticism and lack of scientific evidence to a desire to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical industry, the official stance of many Western governments is to discourage the use of these remedies. This closed-minded approach can further exacerbate the issue, as the understanding, acceptance, and use of alternative healthcare practices and supplements could have considerable potential in helping to stave off the aforementioned scourges, reduce overall healthcare costs, and improve public health. Moreover, the breakdown in the system is not just limited to the attitudes and practices surrounding diet and healthcare, but extends to other fundamental aspects of society. This can include economic disparities, political corruption, environmental degradation, and societal divisions. These challenges can all contribute to an overall decline in the health and wellbeing of populations, as they create a landscape in which access to adequate healthcare and resources becomes increasingly difficult. In order to address this multifaceted issue, it is crucial for a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to be undertaken. This could involve: 1. Increased emphasis on the importance of healthy, balanced diets, as well as greater accessibility to fresh, nutrient-dense foods. 2. Wider acceptance and understanding of alternative healthcare practices and supplements, as well as support for continued research into their effectiveness and potential benefits. 3. Greater action to tackle the underlying societal issues, including income disparity, political corruption, and environmental irresponsibility, in order to create a more stable and equitable social structure that supports the health and wellbeing of all citizens. Ultimately, it is only through a combination of these efforts that the current breakdown in the system can be adequately addressed and rectified. By recognizing the interconnected nature of these issues and taking a holistic approach to problem-solving, it is possible to create a healthier, more resilient society that is capable of overcoming the challenges of diet-related diseases and moving towards a brighter future."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In the days of Romania’s Habsburg royal family, Bran Castle was given to Queen Marie, the last Queen consort of Romania and granddaughter of Queen Victoria. When she died of cirrhosis, on July 18, 1938, she bequeathed the castle to her daughter Princess Ileana. But after the Communists came to power in 1948, the family was given 24 hours to leave the country. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Bran Castle was restored to them - and Ileana’s son Dominic and daughters Maria Magdalena and Elizabeth have been running it ever since.

Moreover, they provided a statement and are asking whether it is a good answer to their question. Step 2: Analyzing the provided statement The statement given is: \\"The freedom to form, declare membership in, or campaign for candidates from a political party is considered a measurement of a state's adherence to liberal democracy as a political value.\\" This statement talks about the freedom and rights related to political parties as a reflection of a state's adherence to liberal democracy, but it does not directly explain how parties are regulated. Step 3: Crafting an answer to the user's question To answer the user's question adequately, I need to provide information about how political parties are regulated in general. Answer: Political parties are regulated to ensure fair competition, transparency, and accountability in the political process. Regulations can vary by country, but common methods of regulation include: 1. Registration of parties: Parties are often required to register with government institutions, such as an electoral commission or regulatory body, and adhere to certain requirements, like having a specific number of members or fulfilling financial and administrative obligations. 2. Rules for party financing: Parties may be subject to rules related to campaign financing, financial reporting, and disclosure to prevent corruption or the influence of special interests on political decisions. 3. Internal party governance: Countries can set requirements for the internal organization of political parties, such as democratic principles for the election of party leaders, establishing clear and transparent decision-making processes, and ensuring gender equality or minority representation. 4. Media and advertising rules: Parties might need to adhere to rules regarding equal access to media coverage or limitations on political advertising. 5. Sanctions and penalties: Regulatory bodies can impose sanctions or penalties on parties that fail to follow the rules and regulations, like fines, loss of public funding, or even deregistration. Regarding the statement provided, it does reflect the importance of freedom and democracy in relation to political parties but does not directly address the regulation aspect.

The negatives listed, such as eggs not cooking all the way through, difficulty in flipping the eggs, the deterioration of the Teflon surface, and the resulting quality of the cooked eggs, outweigh the single positive of merely getting the job done. The user does acknowledge that some of these issues might be a common problem with mini pans in general, but they specifically mention dissatisfaction with the cheap Teflon, which could imply that they would consider recommending another product with better quality materials. The fact that the user gave the product more than one star because it does cook implies that the recommendation, if any, would be weak at best.

Mayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, an art teacher of Finnish descent, and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer who worked for water companies. Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years. She has a younger brother. She would later describe herself as having been \\"painfully shy\\" as a child and teenager. She \\"never had fewer than one after-school activity per day,\\" participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies. During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her \\"criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence\\". At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science. When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team. She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics. She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad. Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up. During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk. After graduating from high school in 1993, Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia. Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon, Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University. She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems, a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science. At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools. During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor. The class was so well received by students that Roberts asked Mayer to teach another class over the summer. Mayer went on to graduate with honors from Stanford with a BS in symbolic systems in 1997 and an MS in computer science in 1999. For both degrees, her specialization was in artificial intelligence. For her undergraduate thesis, she built travel-recommendation software that advised users in natural-sounding human language. In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search. Mayer interned at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and Ubilab, UBS's research lab based in Zurich, Switzerland. She holds several patents in artificial intelligence and interface design.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Sammon fired home from close range after Steven Smith's shot was blocked on the line. Jones made it 2-0 before half time with a neat finish after Kris Boyd's head-flick set him up. The win takes Kilmarnock to 38 points and they now cannot finish bottom of the Premiership. Killie also moved back into seventh spot in the table, while Hamilton are now level on 32 points with second-from-bottom Motherwell. Hamilton got off to a bright start as Massimo Donati played in Dougie Imrie down the right. His shot looked destined for the top corner, but Kilmarnock keeper Freddie Woodman did well to get a hand to the ball and divert the shot on to the post. Kilmarnock settled into the game after that and they took the lead in the 11th minute. The goal came from a well worked corner, with the ball eventually falling to Sammon and he applied the finish. The away side doubled their lead thanks to a flick-on from a throw in. Boyd nodded the ball into the box and there was Jones to fire low past Hamilton keeper Remi Matthews. Woodman then did well to save from an Imrie header, getting a touch to divert the ball on to the left-hand post. Woodman had to be in fine shot-stopping mode again to prevent Accies from getting back into this match in the second half. Greg Docherty had the shot from the edge of the area, but Woodman was not to be beaten. There was a big call for a penalty for Kilmarnock when Jones appeared to be bundled over in the box by Georgios Sarris, but there was not enough in it for referee Willie Collum and he waved play on. There is little doubt interim boss Lee McCulloch has brought a greater solidity to this Kilmarnock side. Experienced campaigners such as Boyd, Smith and Gary Dicker, allied with talented youngsters such as Kristoffer Ajer, Greg Taylor and Jones playing in harmony, makes for an impressive unit pulling in the right direction. Had Imrie's chances found the net, this would have been a different story and Woodman deserves great credit in the Kilmarnock goal for denying the winger twice. On the evidence of this display, Killie should have more than enough to avoid the play-off place as well, but the future looks more precarious for Accies. Hamilton manager Martin Canning: \\"I have said the last few weeks that, even when you win, you can't get too high and where you lose you can't get too low. \\"It was a strange game, because we controlled large parts of the game and we didn't defend our box well enough. \\"I don't remember Kilmarnock having many attempts at goal. \\"Credit to Kilmarnock. When they got their goals, they defended properly, two or three fantastic blocks to stop us getting strikes away. \\"We have had a bit of bad luck, Dougie Imrie has hit the outside of the post and the inside of the post. It just wasn't to be today.\\" Interim Kilmarnock manager Lee McCulloch: \\"Delighted with that - I didn't know that [that his side cannot now finish 12th]. \\"The focus has just been ourselves. It's not been anyone up above us or down below us. \\"It's about coming into training every day and getting better every day. Getting better individually and as a team, not just the players but the staff too. \\"Pleased with the result, but we're not home and dry yet. \\"Didn't start too well, great set-play for the goals, something we have worked on several times this week. \\"Peter Leven, the assistant manager, is always full of ideas.

According to the Inner Mongolia Morning Post, the tragedy occurred on the afternoon of December 14, 2002 when three school students skating on a frozen lake in Qingcheng Park in Hohhot fell through the ice into the freezing water. More than 20 university students who happened to be near the spot immediately went to the rescue of the children. Two children were quickly rescued, but the third died. The child's body was not found for three hours. Two of the rescuers, Liu Ye and Hao Longbiao, also died of cold and exhaustion . The body of Hao and who took the lead in jumping into the lake was not found until the next day. A student who was unwilling to tell his name said he and his classmates from the local college were taking photos at the lake. When they heard the children's cries for help, they went to the ice hole hand in hand to rescue the children. But the ice kept breaking, causing most of then to fall into the icy water. Local residents held mourning ceremonies at the lake. Eight of the students were seriously affected by the freezing water and were being kept in hospital for further observation, but their lives were no longer in danger.

So , with that in mind , how has your summer been since we last talked ? Answer the following question: What may be the reason for animosity ?","completion":"Animosity can arise from various reasons in different situations. In interpersonal relationships, animosity may stem from misunderstandings, unaddressed conflicts, jealousy, or competition. To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, I will explore several potential causes for animosity: 1. Misunderstandings: Sometimes, animosity can develop because of a simple miscommunication or misunderstanding. It is natural for people to have different opinions and perspectives, but if these are not clearly expressed or understood, conflicts and resentment can build up. 2. Unaddressed Conflicts: Animosity might arise when conflicts or disagreements are not adequately resolved between individuals. This can happen when parties avoid confrontation or communication, leading to unresolved issues and negative emotions festering under the surface. 3. Jealousy: When one person perceives another as having advantages or benefits they feel they deserve, jealousy can ensue and fuel animosity. This jealousy might be related to personal, social, or professional factors, such as recognition, achievements, or relationships with others. 4. Competition: Often, animosity arises out of a sense of competition, be it professional or personal. The desire to outperform others can create feelings of resentment and hostility if not managed healthily. 5. Ego: At times, individuals with high egos may not take constructive criticism or setbacks well, leading to resentment towards those who are identified as instigators of these “attacks.” This can result in animosity between the involved parties. 6. Different Values and Beliefs: People with distinct cultural, social, or religious backgrounds, values, and beliefs may not see eye to eye on particular issues, leading to disagreements and potentially animosity. 7. Past Traumas or Grudges: Animosity can be rooted in past experiences or negative encounters with specific individuals. These lingering emotions cause resentment and hostility to affect present interactions. 8. Personality Clashes: Some personalities just do not mix well, as differences in temperament, communication styles, and demeanor can provoke animosity. 9. Lack of Empathy: In certain situations, one party may perceive the other as insensitive, uncaring, or dismissive. This perception can foster feelings of animosity between individuals as the aggrieved party may feel disrespected or unheard. 10. Unfair Treatment: Perceived unfair treatment or discrimination can be a significant cause of animosity. People who feel that they are not being treated equally or justly tend to harbor negative feelings towards those they deem responsible. In conclusion, various factors might contribute to animosity between individuals. Different personalities, values, experiences, or emotions can lead to conflicting opinions or misunderstandings that cause friction. It is essential to engage in open communication, display empathy, and actively work toward conflict resolution measures to address animosity, repair relationships, and maintain harmonious interactions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

The story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez and Mia Samonte. The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat. One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride. Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice. Mia left for Malaysia. Two years after, when Allan finally broke free from his indecision, he went to Malaysia to look for Mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy. It was now Mia's turn to make a choice. She chose the new guy who loved her so much and the one she knew could help her support her family. Even though she honestly knew in her heart that she still loved Allan. Allan did not lose hope. He patiently waited for Mia for another three years. He firmly believed that she would come back to him as predicted by the old man earlier in the story.

How do you do this: How to make your lava for your DIY lava lamp?","completion":"To make the lava for your DIY lava lamp, follow these step-by-step instructions. Each step is justified for the efficient and safe creation of the lava effect. Step 1: Gather materials 1.1. Collect a clear plastic or glass bottle, preferably with a smooth and cylindrical shape. (Ensures better visibility for the lava effect.) 1.2. Acquire food coloring or liquid watercolor (helps create the desired color for the lava). 1.3. Obtain vegetable oil or a lighter oil such as baby oil (creates the separation needed for the lava effect). 1.4. Get water (serves as the other medium for the lava to move through). 1.5. Collect an antacid tablet, preferably one that dissolves easily (provides the bubbling effect that moves the lava). 1.6. Optional: LED light, flashlight, or other light source (enhances the visual effect of the lava lamp). Step 2: Prepare the bottle 2.1. Thoroughly clean the bottle, ensuring there's no residue (provides a clear viewing experience for observing the lava effect). 2.2. Fill the bottle about ⅓ to ¼ full with water (provides proper space for the oil and lava effect to occur without spilling). Step 3: Add oil 3.1. Carefully pour the oil into the bottle, leaving about an inch or so of empty space at the top (this allows room for expanding when the antacid reacts, and provides the medium through which the lava effect will happen). 3.2. Wait for the oil and water to separate completely (this is crucial, as the separation creates the lava motion). Step 4: Add color 4.1. Add a few drops of food coloring or liquid watercolor to the bottle (creates a colorful lava effect and makes it easy to see the movement of the lava). 4.2. Wait for the color to spread and mix with the water at the bottom (the oil and water won't mix, ensuring the color remains in the water). Step 5: Create the lava effect 5.1. Break the antacid tablet into smaller pieces (allows for a controlled release of bubbles). 5.2. Drop one piece of the antacid tablet into the bottle (the tablet will begin to dissolve in the water, creating bubbles. These bubbles will carry the colored water upward into the oil, creating the lava effect). 5.3. Continue adding pieces of the antacid tablet to maintain the lava effect (make sure to add them one at a time, to prevent the reaction from becoming too strong). Step 6: Lighting (optional) 6.1. Position your LED light or flashlight underneath the bottle, shining up through the bottom (enhances the visual effect of the lava lamp, making it more striking and vibrant). That's it! Now you have a homemade lava lamp with a captivating lava effect. Enjoy watching your lava flow, and feel free to experiment with different colors and bottle sizes to achieve various lava lamp designs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation. Paragraph: Both Alabama and Florida boast great wetlands. The State of Alabama has experienced extensive drainage system due to expansion of farmlands. Their neighboring state Florida had similar system. But recently Florida had dismantled many of their drainage systems, mostly because of pressure from different environmental groups. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Alabama have stable or declining waterfowl species? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that Alabama would likely have declining waterfowl species. The paragraph mentions that the expansion of drainage systems had led to significant negative ecological impacts, including the decline of hundreds of thousands of wetland species as their habitat became increasingly fragmented and destroyed. This decline was mainly caused by loss of breeding habitat due to agricultural expansion. In the case of Alabama, the state experienced extensive drainage system development as a result of the expansion of farmlands. This would suggest that Alabama's wetlands also experienced habitat degradation, fragmentation, and destruction, similar to other regions where drainage systems were expanded. On the other hand, Florida recently dismantled many of its drainage systems, mostly due to pressure from environmental groups. This action presumably has helped to alleviate some of the negative impacts on wetland species in that state. However, the paragraph does not provide any information about Alabama taking similar steps to dismantle or mitigate the effects of its drainage systems on wetlands and waterfowl species. Given the ecological background and the specific situation in Alabama, it is reasonable to conclude that waterfowl species in the state would likely be experiencing declines. The significant drainage system expansion would have led to habitat loss and degradation, which in turn negatively impacts the population and stability of waterfowl species. In order to address this issue, Alabama would need to take measures similar to Florida, such as dismantling or mitigating the impacts of their drainage systems to protect and restore vital wetland habitats for waterfowl and other species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both of the sentences convey the same message in that both individuals—Board Chancellor Robert Bennett and Mr. Mills—refused to comment on personnel matters. However, they express the message with slightly different sentence structures and contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Board Chancellor Robert Bennett declined to comment on personnel matters Tuesday, as did Mills,\\" the sentence tells us that Robert Bennett, referred to by his official title, chose not to comment on personnel matters. Additionally, the sentence also informs us that this decision occurred on Tuesday. The phrase \\"as did Mills\\" informs us that Mills, too, did not wish to discuss personnel matters. In this sentence, Mills is not directly quoted but is mentioned in the context of Bennett's actions. In the second sentence, \\"Mr. Mills declined to comment yesterday, saying that he never discussed personnel matters,\\" we learn that Mr. Mills made the decision not to comment on personnel matters. In this instance, the sentence uses \\"yesterday\\" instead of a specific day of the week. Unlike the first sentence, Mr. Mills is directly quoted in the second sentence, revealing his personal explanation for declining to comment: \\"he never discussed personnel matters.\\" In summary, both sentences communicate the same core message—neither Robert Bennett nor Mr. Mills were willing to comment on personnel matters.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What are some real life ghost stories? What are some real stories that made you believe in ghosts?","completion":"While these questions appear to be similar at first glance, they are subtly different in their emphasis and the types of responses they are likely to generate. 1. \\"What are some real life ghost stories?\\" This question asks for actual accounts or narratives involving ghosts or supernatural occurrences. It focuses on the stories themselves, with the implicit assumption that these ghost stories are based on real-life events. Respondents to this question may be more inclined to share ghost stories they have heard or read about, rather than limiting themselves to their own personal experiences. Examples might include historical ghost stories, urban legends, or incidents recounted by others. Overall, this question seeks to gather a collection of ghost stories that supposedly happened in real life. 2. \\"What are some real stories that made you believe in ghosts?\\" This question is more personal and directs the focus to the impact these stories had on the respondents by making them believe in ghosts. This question assumes that the respondent didn't necessarily believe in ghosts initially but was convinced by certain stories they came across or experienced themselves. As such, it is more likely to elicit personal anecdotes and testimonials, rather than widely circulated or well-known ghost stories. The emphasis in this question is on the power of the story to influence beliefs and potentially change the way people perceive the supernatural. In this case, the stories shared should have a strong personal meaning for the respondents, having left a lasting impression on them. In conclusion, both questions explore the world of ghost stories and paranormal experiences, but with different perspectives – the first question focuses on the stories themselves, while the second question is more interested in the impact those stories had on people's beliefs. As a result, the answers to each question may overlap to some extent, but the way they are framed and presented will differ based on the emphasis of the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" I am facing a new situation today: Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to die after this event? A:","completion":"Based on the background article and the situation you have described, Michael, who was directly exposed to high doses of radiation due to the explosion while replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor, is more likely to die after this event. The background article explains that high doses of radiation result in Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), with symptoms like skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and ultimately, death. This is consistent with the level of exposure that Michael experienced, being in the direct vicinity during the explosion. In contrast, Robert was in the adjacent room when the incident happened. This means he was exposed to a smaller, or lower dose of radiation. While any amount of radiation can increase the chance of cancer and genetic damage, the risk of immediate life-threatening conditions as with ARS is significantly lower compared to a high dose exposure. Still, Robert should undergo medical evaluations and treatment to mitigate long-term effects as much as possible. It is important to consider, however, that calculating the exact risk and chance of health issues caused by ionizing radiation is complex and estimates are not precise. Scientists use models based on population data from past nuclear incidents such as Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl, but the International Commission on Radiological Protection admits that there are uncertainties and lack of precision in these models. Thus, overall, the risks are higher for Michael due to his direct, high dose exposure. Nonetheless, both Michael and Robert need immediate medical attention to address and monitor the health effects of the radiation exposure."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

JPop star shaves her head and issues tearful YouTube apology because she spent night with a man By Agence France-Presse Friday, February 1, 2013 7:59 EDT A Japanese starlet who shaved her head and issued a tearful YouTube apology after spending the night with a man was scrambling Friday to redeem the girl next door image of all-female group AKB48. Pictures of the roughly-shorn head of Minami Minegishi, 20, were emblazoned on national newspapers and Japan’s Twitter scene was abuzz Friday over news that the pop princess had broken the band’s cardinal rule: No Dating. A sobbing Minegishi told fans she had decided to shave her head as an act of contrition after a popular weekly magazine published claims of a night of passion with a 19-year-old boy band member. “I don’t believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don’t want to quit AKB48,” she says in the video, which had been viewed on YouTube more than three million times. Minegishi, who had long, silky hair at the time, was snapped leaving the apartment of Alan Shirahama, a dancer in an off-shoot of the popular boy band Exile. Tabloid magazine Shukan Bunshun published its article Thursday, and hours later Minegishi was pleading to be allowed to remain with AKB48, one of the world’s most successful acts by revenue. The tryst was “thoughtless and immature” she told fans. “If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band. Everything I did is entirely my fault, I am so sorry.” AKB48, a 90-strong pool of girls in their teens and early 20s, is a money-printing juggernaut that makes much of the accessibility — and the implied availability — of its idols. Fans have frequent opportunities to meet their favorites, who are rotated in and out of the public eye, according to popularity. In return for their chance to grace television screens, subway adverts and the covers of Japan’s countless celebrity magazines, members of the collective must adhere to strict rules of behavior. They are allowed to have “one-sided romantic feelings” for a boy but can never progress beyond hinting at their crush — and must never disabuse their legions of male fans that they might one day stand a chance with their fantasy woman. In June last year, another AKB48 member, Rino Sashihara, 20, made a pained apology after a magazine article revealed her free-wheeling history with a boy. She was demoted to a regional sub-group as a punishment. While much is made of their supposed innocence, the band is heavily marketed on its sex appeal, with skimpy outfits and coquettish smiles the order of the day. A television commercial in which the girls seductively passed candy from mouth to mouth was a huge hit, despite — or because — of its homoerotic overtones, which sparked complaints from more conservative sections of society. Most recently, a photograph that showed naked former AKB48 member Tomomi Kasai with a young, apparently Caucasian or Eurasian child cupping her breasts, set off police probe and led to the pulping of about 670,000 copies of a popular weekly magazine. Watch the video, published to YouTube on Jan. 31. ||||| As pop star misdemeanours go, Minami Minegishi's was tame in the extreme – breaking her group's strict dating ban to spend a night with her boyfriend. Yet hours after a magazine published photographs of her leaving his home last month, Minegishi, a member of the wildly popular girl band AKB48, went on to YouTube to issue a tearful apology. \\"As a senior member of the group, it is my responsibility to be a role model for younger members,\\" she said, before ending the four-minute mea culpa with a deep, lingering bow. The most striking thing about her apology, however, was her appearance. She had shaved her head, a traditional act of contrition in Japan, but perhaps a step too far for a 20-year-old woman whose \\"crime\\" was to have found herself a boyfriend – 19-year-old Alan Shirahama, a dancer in a boyband. Minegishi explained she had decided to cut off her long hair immediately after seeing her photograph, her face hidden behind a surgical mask and a baseball cap, in the weekly tabloid Shukan Bunshun on Thursday. Her dramatic gesture underlined the strict rules to which Japan's young pop stars must adhere to project an image of unimpeachable morals. In the YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 3m times, Minegishi said the assignation has been \\"thoughtless and immature\\". \\"If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band,\\" she said. \\"Everything I did is entirely my fault. I am so sorry. \\"I don't believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don't want to quit AKB48.\\" AKB48's management agency demoted her to \\"trainee level\\" starting on Friday, according to the band's official blog. Minegishi is among the original members of the band, which since it formed in 2005 has built up a huge following among teenage girls and salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands with their idols. The group, named after the geeky Akihabara district of Tokyo, has had a succession of million-selling singles and generated sales of more than £126m in CD and DVD sales in 2011. Together, the AKB48 stable has more than 230 members in their teens and early 20s, with four main bands and several offshoots. Their act is more saccharine than sexual, but the band has courted controversy off-stage in the past year. In 2012, a TV commercial in which the girls seductively passed confectionery from mouth to mouth attracted complaints, and earlier the same year one of the singer's mothers was arrested for allegedly having sex with a minor. Last month, police launched an investigation after a weekly magazine ran a photo of a young boy cupping the breasts of the former AKB48 member Tomomi Kasai. The publisher was forced to destroy about 670,000 copies of the magazine. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Japanese pop star Minami Minegishi, a member of the all-female group AKB48, shaved her head and issued a tearful YouTube apology for spending a night with a man, breaking the band's cardinal rule of no dating.

As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Billy bought pencils and put them in his what? Possible A: classroom, kitchen sink, backpack, cabinet, store Why is \\"backpack\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Backpack\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because in a typical context, people carry pencils in backpacks, especially when referring to a student like Billy. Step 1: Analyze the context of the question The question involves a person (Billy) purchasing pencils, which are primarily used for writing purposes. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers in relation to the context - Classroom: While pencils are often used in classrooms, the question specifically asks where Billy put the pencils after purchasing them, making this a less likely option. - Kitchen sink: It's unusual to store pencils, especially newly purchased ones, in a kitchen sink. This choice is not aligned with common sense. - Backpack: A backpack is a common item used by students and others to carry personal belongings, including school supplies like pencils. This choice aligns with the human common sense because it is a typical location for storing pencils. - Cabinet: While a cabinet can potentially store pencils, it is less likely for a student like Billy to put his newly purchased pencils directly into a cabinet. Backpacks are more closely related to students and their school supplies. - Store: If Billy already bought the pencils, it doesn't make sense that he would put them back in the store. This answer contradicts the premise of the question. Step 3: Conclude based on the evaluations Based on the evaluations, \\"backpack\\" is the most fitting answer aligned with human common sense, as it is a typical context for storing pencils, particularly for students like Billy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To use a screwdriver, follow these simple steps: 1. Pick the right screwdriver: There are different types of screwdriver heads, like flat-head and phillips-head. Make sure to pick the one that matches the screw you want to turn. 2. Hold the handle: The screwdriver has a handle at one end and the metal part, called a blade, at the other end. Hold the handle with your hand. 3. Line up the blade: Place the blade in the groove (the line) on top of the screw. Make sure it is snug and fits well. 4. Turn the screwdriver: - If you want to put the screw in, turn the handle clockwise (like going from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock on a clock). Keep turning until the screw is tightly in place. - If you want to remove the screw, turn the handle counter-clockwise (like going from 12 o'clock back to 9 o'clock). Keep turning until the screw comes out.

Sentence 2: Unfortunately, this disc is blank. Possible answers: (a). yes. (b). it is not possible to tell. (c). no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Answer: (c). no. The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To provide a detailed explanation for this conclusion, let's dissect both sentences and compare their meanings. Sentence 1: 'And this disc...this disc has a message for Peter Greuze. In this sentence, the statement asserts the existence of a disc with the specific purpose of containing a message intended for Peter Greuze. This sentence implies that the disc has some kind of content recorded on it, whether it's an audio message, a written message, a video, or any other mode of communication. Sentence 2: Unfortunately, this disc is blank. In this second sentence, it is mentioned that the disc is blank, which means it does not contain any message or recorded data. This sentence opposes the first sentence's idea, as it states that the disc lacks any embedded content. Now, when we consider the possible answers to the question of whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we must analyze the relationship between the sentences. (a). yes. This answer would imply that the second sentence logically follows from the first sentence, which is not the case, as the first sentence suggests the presence of a message on the disc while the second one denies it. (b). it is not possible to tell. This answer suggests that not enough information is available to determine whether the second sentence is necessarily true or false based on the information provided in the first sentence. However, we can ascertain a relationship between the two sentences, as mentioned earlier. (c). no. This answer correctly reflects the relationship between the two sentences. The second sentence does not logically follow from the first sentence, as they present contradicting information regarding the disc's content. The first sentence indicates that the disc is intended for Peter Greuze and has a message for him, while the second sentence declares that the disc is blank and therefore does not contain any message. In conclusion, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they present opposing information about the disc's content.

But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \\"gun rights\\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish. Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it. But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK.

Instead, the author indirectly links the \\"Nixon administration\\" to the Buell school shooter. This is because the author suggests that the \\"war on drugs\\" begun under the Nixon administration has contributed to the drug-related issues that may have played a role in the Buell shooting incident.

Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, and fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture. In the UK, they have had six number one albums and 13 top 20 singles, including two number ones. - Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars is the third studio album by British big beat musician Fatboy Slim. It was released on 6 November 2000 through Skint Records. It features Macy Gray, Ashley Slater, Bootsy Collins, Roland Clark, Jim Morrison, and Roger Sanchez as guest contributors. The album's title, mentioned in the single \\"Weapon of Choice\\" is an allusion to the Oscar Wilde quote \\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars\\". - Skint Records is a Brighton based dance music record label owned by JC Reid, Tim Jeffery and Damian Harris. It was created as a sublabel of Loaded Records, also founded by Reid and Jeffery. Along with Wall of Sound, the label was a leader in the big beat music scene of the mid to late 1990s. - Roland Clark is a house music DJ, producer, songwriter and vocalist. In the past, he has used the aliases Jesus Jackson, Digital Pimps, Dark Clark, South Street Player, and is also founding member of the dance music project Urban Soul. He learned how to write songs from his childhood mentor Calvin Gaines. - Breakbeat as a term refers to one of two distinct things. Originally it would have referred only to \\"A breakbeat\\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except for the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \\"Breakbeat\\" (2), characterized as a genre of groove-oriented music which utilizes a lo-fi sampled breakbeat (or combination of breakbeats) for the main drum beat, and usually incorporates other lo-fi sampled \\"hits\\" as well. - Propellerheads were a British big beat musical ensemble, formed in 1995 and made up of electronic producers Will White and Alex Gifford. The term \\"propellerhead\\" is slang for a nerd, and when Gifford and White heard a friend from California use this in a conversation, they thought it would be the perfect name for their band. - The Prodigy are an English electronic music group from Braintree, Essex, formed by Liam Howlett in 1990. The members were originally Liam Howlett (keyboardist and composer), Keith Flint (dancer and vocalist), Maxim (MC and vocalist), Leeroy Thornhill (dancer and occasional live keyboardist), and a female dancer and vocalist called Sharky, however, both Leeroy and Sharky left the band for different reasons. - Big beat is an electronic music genre that usually uses heavy breakbeats and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns - common to acid house.

It was established by the conquest of Glamorgan from its native Welsh ruler, by the Anglo-Norman nobleman Robert FitzHamon, feudal baron of Gloucester, and his legendary followers the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan. The Anglo-Norman Lord of Glamorgan, like all Marcher lords, ruled his lands directly by his own law: thus he could, amongst other things, declare war, raise taxes, establish courts and markets and build castles as he wished, without reference to the Crown. These privileges were only lost under the Laws in Wales Acts 15351542. Though possessing many castles, the main seat of the Lordship was Cardiff Castle. - Joan of Acre (April 1272 23 April 1307) was an English princess, a daughter of King Edward I of England and Queen Eleanor of Castile.

Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Early modern Europe is the period of European history between the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, roughly the late 15th century to the late 18th century. Historians variously mark the beginning of the early modern period with the invention of moveable type printing in the 1450s, the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the end of the Wars of the Roses in 1487, the beginning of the High Renaissance in Italy in the 1490s, the end of the \\"Reconquista\\" and subsequent voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas in 1492, or the start of the Protestant Reformation in 1517. The precise dates of its end point also vary and are usually linked with either the start of the French Revolution in 1789 or with the more vaguely defined beginning of the Industrial Revolution in late 18th century Britain. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain.

Now one of Edward 's strongest supporters , he accompanied the king on a campaign to Scotland in 1314 , when several other nobles refused . He was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June , under somewhat unclear circumstances . Gloucester was the most prominent of the casualties of the battle , which ended in a humiliating defeat for England . As he had no issue , his death marked the end of the prominent de Clare family . His estates were divided between his three sisters , one of whom was married to the king 's new favourite , Hugh Despenser the Younger .

The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 re-introduced the term for certain \\"principal areas\\" in Wales. Scotland did not have county boroughs but instead counties of cities. These were abolished on 16 May 1975. All four Scottish cities of the time Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow were included in this category. There was an additional category of large burgh in the Scottish system, which were responsible for all services apart from police, education and fire. - Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 7th Earl of Gloucester, 3rd Lord of Glamorgan, 9th Lord of Clare (2 September 1243 7 December 1295) was a powerful English noble.

In medieval and Early Modern Europe, among other times and places, the term is used of individuals delegated significant political power by a ruler. It was especially a phenomenon of the 16th and 17th centuries, when government had become too complex for many hereditary rulers with no great interest in or talent for it, and political institutions were still evolving. From 1600 to 1660 there were particular successions of all-powerful minister-favourites in much of Europe, especially in Spain, England, France and Sweden. - Glamorgan or, sometimes, Glamorganshire (or ) is one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales and a former administrative county of Wales.

Hypothesis: A man playing cards in Las Vegas. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis that the man is playing cards in Las Vegas. While it is possible that the scenario could occur in Las Vegas, there are several missing elements and assumptions that need to be addressed before we can make such a conclusion. First, let us consider the elements of the premise: 1. A man in a dog outfit: This could potentially occur at any location, not necessarily specific to Las Vegas. The man's choice of attire may not be indicative of the setting. 2. Playing at a card table: The presence of a card table indicates a potential gambling situation, which is a common association with Las Vegas. However, card tables can be found at other casinos or even at private card-gaming events throughout the world. Therefore, the card table alone is insufficient evidence to conclude the Las Vegas location. 3. A bemused woman and dealer: Their reactions could again happen at any location and do not provide strong evidence towards the hypothesis. The bemusement might arise from the man's choice of attire or the atmosphere of the game itself but does not necessarily point to Las Vegas. To conclude the hypothesis, we would need more contextual information regarding the setting or specific details that directly link the scenario to Las Vegas. Some examples of such specific details could be: 1. Distinctive and identifiable Las Vegas landmarks or recognizable establishments in the background, such as the famous Las Vegas Strip or specific casino names. 2. The presence of certain games that are synonymous with Las Vegas such as poker, blackjack, or roulette, alongside a description or indication that these games are being played within a Las Vegas casino. 3. Conversations or references among the characters that directly mention or imply their location in Las Vegas. Given the lack of these contextual details in the premise, we cannot conclude the hypothesis that the man is playing cards in Las Vegas specifically. The scenario could occur in a variety of locations, spanning from local social event in a home to other casinos outside of Las Vegas.

Pedestrian facilities include retail shops, museums, mass events (such as festivals or concert halls), hospitals, transport hubs (such as train stations or airports), sports infrastructure (such as stadiums) and religious infrastructures. The transport mode in such infrastructures is mostly walking, with rare exceptions. Can we infer the following? Pedestrian facilities are important.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that pedestrian facilities are important, as they cater to a diverse range of human needs and are essential to the functioning of cities and communities. The significance of pedestrian facilities can be analyzed from multiple perspectives, including urban design, economic, social, and environmental aspects. Here is a detailed explanation of the importance of pedestrian facilities: 1. Urban design perspective: Well-designed pedestrian facilities promote walkability, which is a crucial aspect of sustainable urban design. By encouraging people to walk more, pedestrian facilities help reduce congestion, noise, and pollution in urban areas. Walkable cities are generally more liveable, as they provide a desirable environment for residents and visitors alike. 2. Economic perspective: Pedestrian facilities support the local economy by fostering commercial vitality and contributing to job creation. Retail shops, museums, and other attractions located within pedestrian-friendly areas tend to see increased footfall, resulting in higher revenues and a vibrant economy. Moreover, pedestrian facilities can help attract tourists, boosting the tourism industry. 3. Social perspective: Pedestrian facilities play an essential role in fostering social interaction. Spaces such as parks, squares, and plazas allow people to gather, converse, and engage in activities, thereby strengthening social connections and a sense of belonging to a community. Additionally, mass events such as festivals and concerts can bring people together, promoting cultural exchange and social cohesion. 4. Accessibility: Well-connected and accessible pedestrian facilities allow people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds to access various public services and amenities, such as hospitals, schools, and religious institutions. This ensures a more inclusive and egalitarian society, as it allows everyone to enjoy equal opportunities. 5. Health perspective: Regular walking is associated with various physical and mental health benefits. By offering safe and attractive pedestrian facilities, cities encourage their residents to adopt a more active lifestyle, which can help reduce the prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, walking is associated with reduced stress levels and improved mental well-being. 6. Environmental perspective: Pedestrian facilities contribute to environmental sustainability by promoting walking as a mode of transportation. This reduces the dependency on motor vehicles, leading to lower CO2 emissions, decreased air pollution, and less consumption of non-renewable resources. 7. Heritage and cultural preservation: Pedestrian facilities that incorporate elements of cultural and historical significance can help preserve a city's unique character and identity. By creating opportunities for people to explore and appreciate their surroundings on foot, cities can instill a sense of pride in their cultural heritage and promote sustainable tourism. In summary, pedestrian facilities play a vital role in enhancing the overall quality of life in urban areas by addressing various economic, social, health, environmental, accessibility, and cultural needs. Their significance cannot be overstated, as they contribute to the creation of more sustainable, inclusive, and vibrant cities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Pressure washing is almost always a must on older decks, but be sure not to use too much pressure. You can damage the wood if it's turned up too high. Available options: [i] Scrape away old finish with a rake. You can add wood putty to the first few inches of wood to make it easier to remove old finish. [ii] A continuous stream of water, or a powerful jet air stream, will blot away too much staining or warping. If you have a full deck, wet a cloth and wipe down the entire area thoroughly. [iii] Similarly, you can rust the wood by using too much grease. Once the stain has dried to the level of rust on all sides, scrape the stain with a deck scraper, tenderizer, or similar tool until it is off.

Option [iv] is the correct answer as it provides guidelines for the proper pressure range depending on the type of wood. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: [i] Scraping away old finish with a rake is inappropriate for this stage and adding wood putty is not necessary for removing old finish. At this point, the focus should be on letting the deck dry before applying sealer and stain. [ii] Using a continuous stream of water or a powerful jet air stream may cause more damage to the wood and prolong the drying process. The deck has already been washed with the appropriate pressure.

Newark Liberty International not far behind on 90.1. Vancouver International provides least frustrations, scoring only 17.6. Article:","completion":"Title: LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International Top List of Frustrating Airports, While Vancouver International Keeps Travelers Happy Introduction: Air travel can be a stressful experience for many, but it seems that certain airports are more likely to contribute to passenger frustrations than others. A recent survey has ranked LaGuardia Airport in New York and Newark Liberty International in New Jersey as some of the most frustrating, while Vancouver International comes out as the airport with the least frustrations. LaGuardia's High Frustration Score: LaGuardia Airport received a staggering score of 91 out of 100 on the overall frustration scale. This result may not come as a surprise to many, given the airport's infamous reputation for delays, cancellations, and crowded terminals. Furthermore, LaGuardia's constant construction projects have only added to the chaos, leaving passengers feeling more agitated as they navigate the often confusing and congested environment. Newark Liberty International's Close Second: Not far behind LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International scored a 90.1 on the overall frustration scale. Newark has long been plagued with similar issues as LaGuardia, frequently experiencing delays, cancellations, and over-crowding. With few amenities and limited options for dining or shopping, it can be challenging for passengers to keep themselves entertained during these delays. As a result, travelers passing through Newark Liberty International are often left feeling frustrated and eager to continue on their journey. Vancouver International's Impressive Low Frustration Score: On the other end of the spectrum, Vancouver International Airport came out as the location providing the least amount of frustrations for air travelers, scoring an impressive 17.6. Not only does the airport boast a beautiful interior and efficient facilities, but it has also prioritized customer service and cleanliness. This dedication to providing a comfortable environment has resulted in a significantly lower frustration score for passengers, making their travel experience a more enjoyable one. Conclusion: It is clear that certain airports, like LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International, only exacerbate the inherent stresses of air travel. Meanwhile, airports like Vancouver International have demonstrated that destinations can prioritize efficiency, customer service, and cleanliness to create an environment that allows passengers to have a better overall travel experience.

Q: Fact1: Basava lives with brother, Fact2: brother treat him as own son, Fact3: brother start seeking girl as bride, Fact4: auditor is working with Pampathy, Fact5: engagement is fixed with vagabond son of Pampathy A:","completion":"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the hills and a peacefully flowing river, lived a young man named Basava. He was not just dear to his family, but also loved by everyone who knew him in the village. Fact 1: Basava lives with his brother Basava lost his parents when he was barely a teenager, but his elder brother, who worked as a farmer in their ancestral farmland, stood by him like a rock. Though the brother grieved the loss of their parents, he always put a brave face for Basava to ensure that he doesn't feel sad. He was not only a guide but also a father figure to Basava. Basava always found solace in the care of his brother and sister-in-law. Fact 2: Brother treats him as his own son As the years passed, Basava's elder brother took up the role of a father and nurtured him with love and care. He took it upon himself to make sure that Basava received a good education and was always well-provided for. Basava never felt the absence of his parents in the loving care of his brother. He referred to his brother as 'Bade Papa,' which translates to 'Elder Father.' Fact 3: Brother starts seeking a girl as a bride for Basava Now in his mid-twenties, Basava had transformed into a handsome and fine young man. It was time for him to get married and start a family. His brother, the ever-vigilant guiding figure in his life, took to the task of finding a suitable bride for him. Word was sent across the village and nearby towns through matchmakers and friends. Amidst the long list of possible matches, they visited many families in search of the perfect bride for Basava. The love and dedication he had for his brother equaled the pride he had for his prized bull, a symbol of prosperity in the village. He was very cautious as he sought to find a partner who would complement and stand by Basava in every stage of life. Fact 4: Auditor is working with Pampathy In the neighboring town, there lived a well-known and wealthy landowner named Pampathy. People in the village admired Pampathy for his success and congenial nature. He had vast lands and multiple businesses that led to the employment of many people from the region, ensuring their well-being. One of them was an auditor who managed Pampathy's financial records and helped in keeping his affairs in order. Fact 5: Engagement is fixed with the vagabond son of Pampathy As luck would have it, Pampathy also had a daughter named Mridula. She was known for her unparalleled beauty and graceful demeanor. Upon hearing about Mridula, Basava’s brother could not rest until he had met Pampathy and introduced Basava to the family. They were instantly accepted, and the engagement was soon fixed. But there was one hitch – Pampathy had another child, a son who was considered the black sheep of the family. The son was known for his vagabond ways and indifferent behavior, but the family brushed his eccentricities under the carpet. Basava’s brother, willing to put up with the son given the prestige that came with a bond with Pampathy's family, agreed to the alliance. The village began to buzz with excitement as the news of Basava's engagement to Pampathy's daughter spread like wildfire. Preparations were underway to make this union a grand celebration, as everyone in the village wanted to be a part of this joyous occasion. However, life has its way of throwing curveballs, and in the days leading up to the engagement, rumors began to surface of previous misdeeds by Pampathy's vagabond son. This caused Basava's brother to become very cautious as he contemplated the consequences of this alliance. The brother's concern for Basava overpowered everything else, and with a heavy heart, he made a decision that would ensure his brother's happiness, come what may. The engagement was put on hold, and the loving brother resumed his search for the perfect bride for Basava. For all the sacrifices and love the brother poured onto Basava, destiny had a plan to reward their bond. Amidst their search, they eventually discovered a young lady named Meena – a kind soul with a golden heart, who made Basava and his family forget all their past troubles. Basava and Meena's love story was celebrated by one and all, their union heralding a time of great joy in the family. In the end, the efforts of Basava's brother proved fruitful, and the two brothers continued to share their lives, love, and dreams with each other – a testament to the indomitable power of brotherly love."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What animal's scientific name is Ursus Maritimus?","completion":"Ursus Maritimus is the scientific name for the polar bear, which is also commonly known as the white bear or maritime bear. It is a carnivorous bear species native to the Arctic Ocean's surrounding seas and landmasses. This animal is the planet's largest land-dwelling predator and, along with the Kodiak bear, is one of the largest bear species. Polar bears are apex predators, with adults having no natural enemies. The species' name, Ursus Maritimus, is derived from Latin, where \\"Ursus\\" means bear, and \\"Maritimus\\" refers to the sea or coastal regions. This name reflects the polar bear's strong association with the Arctic's icy waters, sea ice, and coastal areas. Polar bears have several adaptations that allow them to thrive in the harsh Arctic conditions, such as their thick insulating fur, a layer of blubber for warmth, and large, flat paws with a rough-textured surface to aid in swimming and walking on ice. The polar bear's primary source of food is seals, particularly the ringed and bearded seals. They rely on sea ice as their hunting platform, where they often patiently wait near breathing holes or stalk seals resting on the ice. Polar bears are also known to scavenge on carcasses of marine mammals, such as whales, when available. These animals have an exceptional sense of smell that allows them to locate their prey across vast distances. Polar bear populations are spread across five nations: Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia, and the United States (Alaska). There are approximately 19 subpopulations of polar bears within the circumpolar Arctic region, numbering approximately 22,000 to 31,000 individuals. However, their habitat and survival are being threatened by climate change, which has led to a rapid reduction and fragmentation of sea ice, posing a significant challenge for these ice-dependent animals. The decline in sea ice has reduced the polar bear's ability to hunt for food, thereby affecting its reproduction, body condition, and overall survival. Moreover, the reduced sea ice also results in more frequent encounters between humans and polar bears, increasing the risk of conflict. Due to these threats, the conservation status of the polar bear is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Numerous conservation efforts are being undertaken to save polar bears and their habitat, including international cooperation via the 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears and their Habitats, which is a treaty signed by the five polar bear range countries. Moreover, regulations are in place to curtail activities that endanger these animals, such as hunting quotas and restrictions. Long-term solutions, however, rely on addressing climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and implementing sustainable environmental practices to preserve the polar bear's habitat for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The name of the knife with a curved blade that is associated with the Gurkhas is called the Khukuri (also spelled as Kukri). The Khukuri is not only a traditional weapon but also a vital utility tool used by the Gurkha people of Nepal and the Indian subcontinent. The Khukuri has a distinctive inwardly curved blade, which is designed for both chopping and slashing maneuvers. Its unique shape allows it to function as a versatile tool, suitable for various tasks ranging from farming and woodworking to hunting and butchering. The blade is typically 10 to 15 inches in length, with a wide and heavy end for generating powerful swings, while the narrow area near the handle provides excellent control for intricate work. The Gurkhas, a warrior class who hail from the mountainous regions of Nepal, have a long and illustrious history of using the Khukuri in times of conflict. Gurkha soldiers have been renowned for their bravery, loyalty, and fighting prowess, and have served as part of the British Army for over 200 years, in the famous Gurkha regiments. The Khukuri has a profound cultural and historical significance for the Gurkhas and the people of Nepal. It is a symbol of national pride, strength, and resilience. The art of crafting a Khukuri has been passed down through generations of skilled blacksmiths, known as \\"kamis.\\" These artisans take great care in forging the blade from high-quality carbon steel and typically use locally available materials such as wood, ivory, or buffalo horn for the handle. Customarily, the Khukuri also has a small accessory, known as a \\"karda\\" or \\"chakmak.\\" The karda is a small knife used for detail work, while the chakmak is a piece of steel used for honing the blade. Both of these can be found in a sheath alongside the main blade. The scabbard for the Khukuri is often made from leather or wood, which is adorned with a variety of decorations that reflect regional and cultural influences. In addition to its use in warfare and as a general-purpose tool, the Khukuri is also prevalent in religious and ceremonial events. It is considered a symbol of prestige and honor in Nepalese society and is often presented as a gift to recognize accomplishments or mark significant milestones. In summary, the Khukuri is a signature weapon and tool associated with the Gurkhas, featuring a curved blade and a rich history rooted deeply in Nepalese culture. Known for its versatility and effectiveness in combat, the Khukuri holds a special place in the hearts of its people and its crafting represents a cherished tradition that continues to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The US was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden.

The next day, he asked his son to earn something. This time he went crying to his sister who gave him a coin. When he showed it to his father he again asked him to throw it in a well. Then the father asked him to earn more money. This time since there was no one to help him, the son was forced to go to the market. One shopkeeper told him he would pay him two coins if he carried his trunk to his house. He did so and sweated plenty. As he returned home he was asked to do the same. The son almost cried out.

Answer the following question: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Well we're not married (yet), but one time my boyfriend playfully spanked me. Hard. I know he didn't mean to hurt me, but I was mad about it all. Day. Long. I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again. I definitely trust him, and he actually was being playful, but otherwise that has been the only “real” hitch we have come across.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Campaigners say 50% of abusers are known to the child or are \\"persons in trust and care-givers\\" A fast-track court in India has convicted two men of raping a 10-year-old girl who gave birth to a baby girl in August. Both the men were the child's uncles. The sentencing is set for Thursday. Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of a stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital. The second uncle was arrested after the baby's DNA sample did not match that of his older brother, the first suspect. The final arguments were completed by the defence on Monday. On Tuesday, the two men were declared guilty in court. The older uncle's trial took a month, while the younger uncle has been convicted in a remarkable 18-day trial, BBC Punjabi's Arvind Chhabra reports from Chandigarh. The harrowing case of the 10-year-old has made headlines for weeks, both in India and globally. She was 30 weeks pregnant when a local court in Chandigarh turned down her abortion plea on the grounds that her pregnancy was too advanced. A doctors' panel had advised that a medical termination would be \\"too risky\\". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds. Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger. The girl was not aware of her pregnancy, and was told her bulge was because she had a stone in her stomach, says the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi. She gave birth in August and the baby was given away to child welfare authorities for adoption. The girl initially told police and child welfare activists that she had been raped several times in the past seven months by the first uncle, who is in his 40s. She had also testified to the court by video link and very clearly named the uncle and revealed details about her abuse. The girl's father had told the BBC that the first uncle had not denied the charges against him. Police also said he had admitted to the allegations. But after his DNA test results did not link him to the baby, police began searching for more suspects - and arrested the second uncle in September. A DNA test confirmed that he was the baby's father. Image copyright AFP Image caption India is home to 400 million children (file picture) The country's courts have received several petitions in recent months, many from child rape survivors, seeking permission to abort. In most cases, these pregnancies are discovered late because the children themselves are not aware of their condition. In September, a 13-year-old girl was given court permission to terminate her pregnancy at 32 weeks. The boy she was carrying was born alive in Mumbai but died two days later. In May, a similar case was reported from the northern state of Haryana where a 10-year-old, allegedly raped by her stepfather, was allowed to abort. She was about 20 weeks pregnant, doctors said. None of the girls can be named for legal reasons. The scale of abuse in India A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015 240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18 53.22% of children who participated in a government study reported some form of sexual abuse 50% of abusers are known to the child or are \\"persons in trust and care-givers\\" Sources: Indian government, Unicef ||||| Watching her favourite cartoon on television at home, little did the 10-year-old rape victim know that just in a few hours a local court will seal the fate of her two maternal uncles, who raped her and one of them impregnated her at this tender age. As the staff and judicial officer of the fast-track trial court prepared for the verdict — three-and-a-half months after the heinous crime came to light — and UT cops got ready to take the two accused to court from the high-security Burail jail, the girl was alone at her home in a southern sector of the city on Tuesday afternoon. “I am unwell. So I did not go to school,” she said, even as she has been regularly attending the school after giving birth to a girl on August 17. Her electrician father and mother, who works as a domestic help, were away for work, while her elder sister had gone to school. Notwithstanding the trauma the family has gone through in the past months, they chose to skip the hearing. In the evening, after the two accused had been convicted of rape, her mother — who was back from work by now — preferred to maintain privacy and drew the curtains of their one-room quarter. Earlier, in court, the woman’s two cousins appeared expressional as additional district and sessions judge Poonam R Joshi held them guilty. While the defence counsels appeared anxious, it seemed the duo didn’t even register what was happening. Even as the wife of the younger uncle — who fathered the minor’s child — was present for the verdict, the family of his elder brother — who are in Nepal — gave the hearing a miss. With the court giving its verdict, the two face up to life imprisonment. The quantum of sentence will be pronounced on Thursday. The two have been found guilty under Section 376 (2) (f) (i) (n) — committing rape on a woman when she is under 12 years of age, a relative and it involves repeated intercourse — of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Sections 5(i) — penetrative sexual assault on the child more than once or repeatedly — and 6 — aggravated penetrative sexual assault — of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The ordeal It was on July 14 that doctors found the girl to be 30-week pregnant when her mother took her to hospital after she complained of a stomach ache. A local court dismissed the girl’s abortion plea, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court, as the doctors said the procedure would be too risky. On the girl’s complaint, police arrested her mother’s cousin, who was a guard at a local hotel, for rape. But the case turned on its head when the DNA samples of the girl’s child — who took birth on August 17 — didn’t match with those of the uncle, as first reported by Hindustan Times on September 11. Seventeen days later, police arrested the man’s younger brother, who turned out to be the main accused. The girl told police that she was first raped by the younger uncle, a cook with the same hotel as his brother, around Christmas in 2016. The older uncle, too, assaulted her repeatedly from April till early July, she said. Initially, the girl didn’t name the younger uncle, fearing he would come good on his threat of killing her parents. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A fast-track court in India has convicted two men for raping a 10-year-old girl who gave birth to a baby girl in August.

The freshness of the herbs used in the dish was notable and added a delightful aroma. For the entrees, I chose the Seared Salmon with Asparagus and a side of Lemon Herb Risotto. The salmon was cooked impeccably—tender and flavorful with a crisp, slightly caramelized crust. The risotto was creamy, perfectly seasoned, and had just the right amount of tanginess from the lemon. My partner opted for the Chicken Marsala with a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes. He particularly enjoyed how the Marsala sauce complemented the chicken without overpowering its natural flavors. The mashed potatoes were rich and smooth with a delightful hint of roasted garlic, which he found to be a fantastic addition. To round off our meal, we shared the Tiramisu for dessert. The layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone cream were expertly crafted, satisfying our craving for a sweet, yet not overly heavy, dessert. The ambience of the restaurant added to the overall enjoyment of our meal. The warm lighting and tasteful decor created a cozy, yet sophisticated atmosphere. Additionally, the spacing between tables allowed for lively conversation without feeling that we were disturbing other diners. The background music added to the pleasant experience without being too loud or intrusive. Though our dining experience was mostly enjoyable, there is a minor area to consider for improvement: the wait time for our main courses could have been a bit shorter. However, this did not significantly impact our overall satisfaction, and we would still highly recommend [Restaurant Name] for a memorable and delightful dining experience. In summary, my partner and I had a splendid time at [Restaurant Name]. The exquisite flavors and presentation of our dishes, combined with the pleasant atmosphere and attentive service, made this experience one to cherish. We are eagerly looking forward to our next visit and highly recommend this restaurant to others seeking a delightful and remarkable dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What school district is Briarcliff High School part of?, using the article: The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there. The Macfadden School ran from 1939 to 1950 at the William Kingsland mansion in the village., what would be the answer ?

Article: In general, people talk about two groups of colours warm colours and cool colours. Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.

Forbes reports that at least fifty rock stars have incomes between two million and six million dollars per year. \\"It doesn't make sense,\\" says Johnny Mathis, one of the older music millionaires, who made a million dollars a year when he was popular in 1950s. \\"Performers aren't worth this kind of money. In fact, nobody is.\\" But the rock stars' admirers seem to disagree. Those who love rock music spend about two billion dollars a year for records. They pay 150 million to see rock stars in person. Luck is a key word for explaining the success of many. In 1972 one of the luckiest was Kon Mclean, who wrote and sang \\"American Pie\\". Mclean writes his own music, so he earns an additional two cents on every single record of the song. Neil Young who performs in torn blue jeans, sometimes sings to an audience of 10,000, each of whom has paid five dollars for a ticket. After paying expenses, Young leaves with about 18,000 in his blue jeans at the end of an evening. How do the rock stars use their money? What do they do when the money starts pouring in like water? Most of the young stars simply show the money around. England's Elton John gave someone a 38,000 Rolls car and bought himself 5,000 pairs of eyeglasses, then lighted up and spelt :E-L-T-O-N. He also bought himself two cars, \\"one for each foot\\". Many rock stars live like Grace Slick and Jefferson Airplane. Those performers return from a tour, pay their bills, and buy new toys. Then when they need money again, they do another tour. They save no money and live _ www.zxxk.com In the end the rock stars' life is unrewarding. After two or three years riches and fame are gone. Left with his memories and his tax problems, the lonely star spends his remaining years trying to attract strangers. New stars have arrived to take his place.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is this about? A computer program known as Brutus.1 is generating brief outbursts of fiction that are probably superior to what many humans could turn out.","completion":"Brutus.1, developed in the 1990s by two researchers, Selmer Bringsjord and David Ferrucci, is an artificial intelligence-based computer program designed to generate brief outbursts of fiction, known as story generations, that are thought to be on par with or even superior to many human-authored literary works. The program's unique ability to create high-quality narrative texts has intrigued many, raising questions about both the technical aspects of this AI software and its potential implications for the field of creative writing. To thoroughly understand Brutus.1, we must first acknowledge its foundation in AI research. This program relies on a combination of knowledge representation, natural language processing (NLP), and logical theorem proving technologies. Knowledge representation entails encoding real-world knowledge in a way that enables machines to reason with that knowledge in a human-like way. NLP is the field responsible for breaking down human languages into forms that machines can understand, while logical theorem proving helps in constructing high-level human-like reasoning based on provided data and information. By utilizing these techniques, Brutus.1 was able to generate authentic and complex storylines that were difficult to distinguish from those composed by humans. The program was built around a specific genre of fiction: stories of betrayal. It was fed a set of rules associated with this theme, allowing it to generate narratives that are both engaging and contextually appropriate. This focus on one theme is essential for the success of Brutus.1, as it limits the narrative scope and requires a more precise understanding of relevant situations, characters, and relationships. The stories generated by Brutus.1 tend to consist of a central betrayal, often involving a friend or colleague, and the ensuing emotional and practical consequences. By drawing on its knowledge base, the program can create realistic characters with complex motivations and emotions. These characters interact and evolve within the narrative, creating unexpected twists and surprising outcomes that are characteristic of the betrayal genre. Arguably, the most significant implication of a program like Brutus.1 is its potential to transform the landscape of creative writing, as it challenges traditional notions of creativity and authorship. Critics argue that machines lack the emotional depth, personal experiences, and intuition that humans draw upon when crafting impactful stories, while proponents of AI-generated literature claim that AI can become a valuable tool for writers by providing suggestions, ideas, and alternatives for their work. In conclusion, Brutus.1 is a pioneering computer program in the field of AI-generated fiction that uses advanced technologies, such as knowledge representation, natural language processing, and logical theorem proving, to create engaging stories focused on betrayal. By generating high-quality narratives that rival human-authored stories, this program not only demonstrates the growing potential of AI in the world of creative writing but also ignites a broader conversation on the role of machines in the creative process and the nature of authorship in the age of artificial intelligence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film opens with a dazzling, attention-grabbing sequence where protagonist Jake Reynolds, played by Tom Carter, attempts to save the Midtown Mall from an imminent terrorist attack with the assistance of his trusted squad. However, this promising start quickly devolves into a heavy-handed and unnecessarily convoluted plot that lacks both creativity and depth. Director John Daniels misses the mark, failing to capitalize on a brilliant premise that could have been the perfect breeding ground for captivating exploits and character development. Instead, audiences are subjected to a disorienting mix of gratuitous explosions, slapstick humor, and exposition-filled dialogue that fails to deliver on the edge of your seat excitement one would expect from a film of this genre. To make matters worse, the villainous character archetypes also feel overstated and worn out—robbing the film of any sense of genuine peril or intrigue. Carter's portrayal of Reynolds lacks nuance and intensity, giving us a shallow and one-dimensional protagonist in an already floundering storyline. His uncanny ability to jump headfirst into danger yet somehow always land on his feet left me questioning how he was ever in danger at all. The supporting cast fails to fare much better - portraying poorly scripted and cookie-cutter characters with little backbone or motivational depth. While the cinematography and visual effects in Meltdown at Midtown are highly commendable, they are ultimately left undermined by a disjointed and unimpressive narrative. The movie's run-time of 145 minutes feels painfully long and overdrawn, considering its lack of substance. As the film nears its climax, even the most ardent action movie fans will find themselves struggling to maintain an interest level that the plodding storyline fails to sustain. In conclusion, Meltdown at Midtown is a prime example of a missed opportunity, and a disappointment for action movie enthusiasts. It's a film that relies too heavily on well-trodden stereotypes and squanders the potential for a unique and engaging story. While certain visual elements of the movie may temporarily mask its glaring shortcomings, they ultimately cannot save it from being forgettable and uninspiring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They are particularly scornful of a certain \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill (Robert Preston), who goes into a town, sells the kids musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms, under the promise that he will form a band for them, and then disappears.

Background: Huey Pierce Long Jr. (August 30, 1893 - September 10, 1935), self-nicknamed The Kingfish, was an American politician who served as the 40th governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932 and as a member of the United States Senate from 1932 until his assassination in 1935. As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful action. He established the long-term political prominence of the Long family. A Democrat and an outspoken populist, Long denounced the wealthy elites and the banks. Context: Once in office as governor on May 21, 1928, Long moved quickly to consolidate his power, firing hundreds of opponents in the state bureaucracy, at all ranks from cabinet-level heads of departments and board members to rank-and-file civil servants and state road workers. Like previous governors, he filled the vacancies with patronage appointments from his own network of political supporters. Every state employee who depended on Long for a job was expected to pay a portion of his or her salary at election time directly into Long's political war-chest, which raised 50,000 to 75,000 (equivalent to about 700,000 to 1,000,000 in 2013 dollars) each election cycle. The funds were kept in a famous locked \\"deduct box\\" to be used at Long's discretion for political and personal purposes. The American historian David Kennedy wrote that the extremely authoritarian regime Long established in Louisiana was \\"... the closest thing to a dictatorship that America has ever known\\". Once his control over the state's political apparatus was strengthened, Long pushed a number of bills through the 1929 session of the Louisiana State Legislature to fulfill campaign promises. These included a free textbook program for schoolchildren, an idea advanced by John Sparks Patton, the Claiborne Parish school superintendent, and the Long confidant, Representative Harley Bozeman of Winnfield. Long also supported night courses for adult literacy (which taught 100,000 adults to read by the end of his term), and a supply of cheap natural gas for the city of New Orleans. Long began an unprecedented public works program, building roads, bridges, hospitals, and educational institutions. Huey P. Long's reign of legislation brought textbooks, a highway, natural gas heating to New Orleans, and buildings still standing at LSU. His bills met opposition from many legislators, wealthy citizens, and the media, but Long used aggressive tactics to ensure passage of the legislation he favored. He would show up unannounced on the floor of both the House and Senate or in House committees, corralling reluctant representatives and state senators and bullying opponents. These tactics were unprecedented, but they resulted in the passage of most of Long's legislative agenda. By delivering on his campaign promises, Long achieved hero status among the state's rural poor population. When Long secured passage of his free textbook program, the school board of Caddo Parish, home of conservative Shreveport, sued to prevent the books from being distributed, saying it would not accept \\"charity\\" from the state. Long responded by withholding authorization for locating an Army Air Corps base nearby until the parish accepted the books. In the 1930 legislative session, Long proposed another major road-building initiative as well as the construction of a new capitol building in Baton Rouge. The State Legislature defeated the bond issue necessary to build the roads, and his other initiatives failed as well. Long responded by suddenly announcing his intention to run for the U.S. Senate in the Democratic primary of September 9, 1930. He portrayed his campaign as a referendum on his programs: if he won he would take it as a sign that the public supported his programs over the opposition of the legislature, and if he lost he promised to resign. Long defeated incumbent Senator Joseph E. Ransdell, an Alexandria native from Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish, by 149,640 (57.3 percent) to 111,451 (42.7 percent). Although his Senate term began on March 4, 1931, Long completed most of his four-year term as governor, which did not end until May 1932. He declared that leaving the seat vacant for so long would not hurt Louisiana; \\"with Ransdell as Senator, the seat was vacant anyway.\\" By not leaving the governor's mansion until January 25, 1932, Long prevented Lieutenant Governor Paul N. Cyr, a former ally, from succeeding to the office. A dentist and geologist from Jeanerette in Iberia Parish, Cyr had subsequently broken with Long and been threatening to roll back his reforms if he succeeded to the governorship. In his autobiography, Long recalled: On another occasion the greatest publicity was given to a charge made by Lieutenant Governor Cyr that I had performed a swindle worse than that of Teapot Dome in the execution of an oil lease ... The oil lease in question had been made by Governor Parker, and no act had been taken by me, except to permit the holder to enter into a drilling contract. Our reply was practically buried by most of the newspapers. Long continued to maintain effective control of Louisiana while he was a senator, blurring the boundary between federal and state politics. Though he had no constitutional authority to do so, Long continued to draft and press bills through the Louisiana State Legislature, which remained in the hands of his allies. He made frequent trips to Baton Rouge to pressure the Legislature into enacting his legislation. The program included new consumer taxes, elimination of the poll tax, a homestead tax exemption, and increases in the number of state employees. While physically in Louisiana, Long customarily stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, where he was fond of the Sazerac Bar (see Peychaud's Bitters). According to Thomas M. Mahne in the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Long had a personal interest in seeing to the quick construction of Airline Highway (US 61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans as the new road cut 40 miles from the trip. Long's loyal lieutenant, Governor Oscar K. Allen, dutifully enacted Long's policies. Long berated the governor in public and took over the governor's office in the State Capitol when visiting Baton Rouge. On occasion, he even entered the legislative chambers, going so far as to sit on representatives' and senators' desks and sternly lecture them on his positions. He also retaliated against those who voted against him and used patronage and state funding (especially highways) to maneuver Louisiana toward what opponents called a Long \\"dictatorship\\". Having broken a second time after earlier reconciliation with the Old Regulars and Mayor Walmsley in the fall of 1933, Long inserted himself into the New Orleans mayoral election of 1934. A second rift hence developed with the city government that lasted even until after Long's assassination. In 1934, Long and James A. Noe, an independent oilman and member of the Louisiana Senate from Ouachita Parish, formed the controversial Win or Lose Oil Company. The firm was established to obtain leases on state-owned lands so that its directors might collect bonuses and sublease the mineral rights to the major oil companies. Although ruled legal, these activities were done in secret, and the stockholders were unknown to the public. Long made a profit on the bonuses and the resale of those state leases and used the funds primarily for political purposes. By 1934, Long began a reorganization of the state government that reduced the authority of local governments in anti-Long strongholds New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Alexandria. It further gave the governor the power to appoint all state employees. Long passed what he called \\"a tax on lying\\" and a 2 percent tax on newspaper advertising revenue. He created the Bureau of Criminal Identification, a special force of plainclothes police answerable only to the governor. He also had the legislature enact the same tax on refined oil that in 1929 had nearly led to his impeachment, which he used as a bargaining chip to promote oil drilling in Louisiana. After Standard Oil agreed that 80 percent of the oil sent to its refineries would be drilled in Louisiana, Long's government refunded most of these tax revenues. Question: what else did he do during 1932?. Whats the answer?","completion":"In 1932, Huey Long continued to exert his influence on Louisiana state politics while serving as a U.S. Senator. He maintained effective control over the state by drafting and pushing bills through the Louisiana State Legislature, which was dominated by his allies. Long made frequent trips to Baton Rouge to pressure the legislature into enacting his legislation. His program during this time included new consumer taxes, elimination of the poll tax, a homestead tax exemption, and increases in the number of state employees. While physically in Louisiana, Long stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans and took a personal interest in the construction of the Airline Highway (US 61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, as the new road reduced the distance by 40 miles. During this time, Long's loyal lieutenant, Governor Oscar K. Allen, continued to implement Long's policies in Louisiana. Long publicly berated Allen and didn't hesitate to literally take over the governor's office in the State Capitol during his visits to Baton Rouge. Long's aggressive tactics extended to entering the legislative chambers and directly addressing representatives and senators to pressure them on his positions. Long also focused on consolidating his power and retaliating against his opponents at the state and local levels. In 1932, Long continued his efforts to establish control over local governments, particularly in anti-Long strongholds like New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Alexandria. He passed legislation that not only reduced the authority of these local governments but also gave the governor the power to appoint all state employees. In conclusion, Huey Long's actions in 1932 were primarily focused on maintaining his control over Louisiana and advancing his political agenda. This was achieved through a mix of new legislation, increasing state control, and aggressive tactics to secure the passage of his favored bills and suppress opposition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

You can't just choke someone who's sleeping!\\") that still plays to the sticks. The show was developed for NBC, Fey's longtime home, and after promoting it for its midseason schedule, the network very politely shunted it to Netflix. Reading between the corporate-speak, it seemed NBC was too ill-equipped to promote a comedy actually designed to be funny. That \\"Kimmy Schmidt\\" was embraced so eagerly by Netflix, with its zeitgeist-y hits \\"Orange Is the New Black\\" and \\"House of Cards,\\" should have been the ultimate vote of confidence. But \\"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\\" is a little less than the sum of its parts. Written with sunny, silly Ellie Kemper (Erin from \\"The Office\\") in mind, the series opens in an underground bunker where doomsday cultist Rev. Richard Wayne Gary Wayne has been keeping four women locked up for 15 years. Kimmy is one of the \\"Indiana mole women,\\" as they are dubbed after their rescue. After their cursory \\"Today\\" show appearance (\\"Thank you, victims!\\"), she decides to press her luck in the Big Apple. She finds a roommate in Titus Andromedon (\\"30 Rock\\" alum Tituss Burgess), a failed actor so flamboyant he couldn't get cast as a straight giraffe in \\"The Lion King,\\" and a boss in Jenna Maroney, er, Jacqueline Voorhes (Parsippany native Jane Krakowski), a wealthy, out-of-touch Upper East Side trophy wife who hires Kimmy to watch her sociopath-in-the-making young son and troublesome teenage stepdaughter. Kemper is delightfully daffy in this modern Mary Tyler Moore role, oozing wonder as she discovers the marvels of the new millennium -- matching tattoos? \\"It's real popular, like taking pictures of your food and being biracial\\" -- and tries to catch up with all that she's missed since middle school. Slang. Windows. \\"Dancing is all about the butts now!\\" I could quote \\"Kimmy Schmidt\\" all day. (Okay, one more: \\"I'm pretty and tough, like a diamond. Or beef jerky in a ball gown.\\") So why am I not nuts about it? It's funnier than most of what's on television these days, but it never coalesces into something spectacular. There are hints of a much darker comedy rooted in Kimmy's underground saga -- when she tries to convince Jacqueline that she can get through anything if she can get through 10 seconds of it ... and then another 10 seconds, or when a plastic surgeon comments on Kimmy's untouched-by-the-sun skin and distinctive \\"scream lines.\\" But the show seems much more content to watch Kemper banana-peel her way through modern life and pick herself back up again. And again. And again. Krakowski is wonderful as always, but Jacqueline's cluelessness about how the other 99 percent lives hits the exact same notes as \\"30 Rock\\"'s Jenna. Even a fine cameo by Martin Short as a renowned (and rubberized) plastic surgeon -- \\"Sidney built Mariah Carey from scratch!\\" -- feels like a rerun of \\"30 Rock\\" quack Dr. Leo Spaceman. The set-up and humor was clearly too out of step with NBC's current sensibilities, and perhaps the first six episodes I viewed reflects an attempt to moderate the show's essential weirdness for broadcast television. The move to Netflix came as Fey and Carlock were editing the back half of the 13-episode order, and Netflix also ordered a second season. \\"30 Rock\\" took a little time to find its footing, and maybe we'll see a more fully-realized series emerge eventually. After all, as Titus, himself a refugee from small town Mississippi, tells Kimmy, \\"Escaping is not the same as making it.\\" Grade: B+ Vicki Hyman may be reached at vhyman@njadvancemedia.com.

All 13 episodes are available for streaming on Friday 6 March on Netflix. What is this show? Kimmy Schmidt (Bridesmaids’ Ellie Kemper) is one of four women rescued from an underground bunker after being imprisoned for 15 years by a crazy polygamist cult leader. When she emerges she knows nothing of the world and has to figure out how to live in New York. Oh, and it’s a sitcom. Seriously? It doesn’t sound funny. Well, then you know nothing about doomsday cult survivors. What’s the show’s pedigree? Tina Fey and fellow 30 Rock veteran Robert Carlock created the show as a 13-episode series for NBC. They decided that they didn’t want it, so NBC sold it to Netflix, which loved it so much they already ordered a second season. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Ellie Kemper stars in Tina Fey's sunny sitcom Read more How does a show transition from NBC to Netflix? It is a dodgy move and the show retains the 22-minute format that network sitcoms share, including being broken down into acts. Some work has been done to smooth over where the commercial breaks would have gone, but it follows a familiar rhythm. Also, there are no swear words or anything that dirty – which is refreshing. What happens in the premiere? Kimmy and three of her fellow “wives” are rescued from a bunker in Indiana. They had been living there in isolation for the past 15 years after the madman who kidnapped them told them that the apocalypse had happened and they were the only humans left alive. On a trip to New York to do an interview with Matt Lauer (of course), Kimmy decides that rather than go back to Indiana, that she wants to stay in New York where no one knows she is a “mole woman”. She finds an apartment being rented by Lillian (Carol Kane) who comes with a roommate, Titus (Tituss Burgess), who describes himself as the gay Tiki Barber. Now that she has a home she has to pay the rent and stumbles into the job as a nanny for the rich, vain, selfish and slightly sad Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). Kimmy welcomes her new life with a smile that can only belong to someone who has yet to learn that both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston are now dead. Is this show any good? If Kimmy Schmidt knew what emoji are, she would describe it as sun, sun, crossout, rain cloud, smiley face, winky face, dancing woman, paint your nails. But Kimmy Schmidt does not know what emoji are (yet) so let’s just say that it is very good and rather funny. Most of the comedy comes from the fact that Kimmy doesn’t know anything about the modern world, and what she does know is incorrect, but she states it with kind the pluck and sincerity that makes you wish she was right. This is a girl who wears light-up sneakers and doesn’t say she was kidnapped but “tooken”. That kind of attention to detail and fine characterisation will feel familiar to 30 Rock fans. It’s not just the presence of Krakowski, playing a more moneyed version of Jenna Maroney, that make this feel like an unofficial sequel to 30 Rock, but the patterns of Tina Fey’s comedy so evident in the writing. When Kimmy accidentally tries to strangle her roommate while sleepwalking she says his neck was covered in grease. “I fell asleep eating a Hot Pocket,” he retorts. If that’s not something that Liz Lemon already said, it certainly sounds like it. What differentiates it from 30 Rock, however, is the darkness just below the surface. As unwaveringly happy as Kimmy is, she still tries to strangle her roommate because she’s having a dream about being locked in a bunker. She has an unexplained fear of Velcro and when a man tries to flirt with her and puts his hands over her eyes and says, “Guess who?” she flips out. Making Kimmy deeply damaged but still inspirational and funny is a difficult line to walk, but this show manages it with aplomb. Which characters will you love? Pretty much everyone. Kimmy, of course, is a weird ray of warped sunshine that will warm your heart. Next to Julia Louis-Dreyfuss on Veep, Kemper as Kimmy is perhaps the best comedic performance on television. Her roommate Titus is a catchphrase slot machine, the hilarious jackpots rolling out with some regularity. And, finally, good on Fey and the other producers for finally bringing Carol Kane back to television. Which characters will you hate? Xanthippe (Dylan Gelula) is the boss’s 15-year-old stepdaughter who is out to expose Kimmy’s secret. She sort of plays the villain but is drawn as such a wonderfully obnoxious tweeting teen that you can’t help being amused by her. What’s the best thing about it? It’s all the little things. The chyrons on all the fake news segments about finding the “mole women” are hilarious, as are Kimmy’s malapropisms (she calls hashtags “hashbrowns”). This is the sort of show that could benefit from multiple viewings, because the jokes are so packed in you’re sure to miss something while laughing. What’s the worst thing about it? The end of each episode after just 22 minutes. Should you watch this show? I can think of nothing better than sitting through all 13 episodes in a row on a rainy afternoon when you need something to live for. That something is a cult survivor who lives in a closet in a basement apartment in Brooklyn. Just trust me. ||||| BINGEWORTHY Lightning strikes twice for Tina Fey. This time it’s on Netflix, where her hilarious, admirably happy new comedy starring a brilliant Ellie Kemper debuts Friday. Prepare to binge. Positive people are annoying. That’s why so many of today’s beloved TV characters are the curmudgeonly, cynical, cranky types. The jaded are our brethren in self-loathing. We delight in laughing along with their pessimistic worldviews, or living vicariously through their unchecked moral bankruptcy. In fact, we want our characters so dark and brooding—and wry and crude—that we’ve even forced TV’s brightest minds to flee the shackles of broadcast television to streaming services like Netflix in order to explore the depths of their depravity more fully. So it’s rather surprising that from Netflix, the network that’s given us Kevin Spacey’s devil in the Oval Office and Litchfield Prison’s ward of disturbed inmates, we’re given TV’s best new character. Her name is Kimmy Schmidt, and her defining characteristic is the brightest, most joyous ear-to-ear smile you’ve ever seen. It’s not an eerie, deranged smile, either. It’s not the grin of a doofus. It’s genuine. It’s pleasing. And, on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Netflix’s new series available for streaming Friday, it’s not being mocked. Instead, it’s inviting us to smile back. Which you do. Quite often. Given pop culture’s obsession with sarcasm and the idea that no bad deed should ever go punished, it’s quite the progressive creative decision to infiltrate all that moodiness with a TV show centered on happiness and positivity. Leave it to Tina Fey to cook up a TV binge that we can feel good about devouring. Created by Fey and her 30 Rock co-genius Robert Carlock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt opens on a moment of sheer bliss in the midst of horrific circumstances. There’s Ellie Kemper (The Office, Bridesmaids) as Kimmy, eyes wide and smile wider, as she puts the star on a Christmas tree. She turns to her friends to talk about Secret Santa presents. It’s only when the group of women begins singing together that we’re clued in to the darkness that surrounds them. “Apocalypse, apocalypse, we caused it with our dumbness,” they sing, to the tune of “O Christmas Tree.” A few quick cuts later, the girls are rescued from the bunker they’ve been living in for 15 years as members of Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne’s doomsday cult. They’re whisked away to New York, where they appear on the Today show and are interviewed by Matt Lauer about their experience as the “Indiana mole women.” The next two minutes sets the tone of the entire series: a high-concept premise, Fey’s signature kooky-sharp writing, and an overtone of sadness and injustice that is ka-pow powered through by Kemper’s relentlessly sunny—though still impressively shaded—performance. (There’s a reason Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt sounds like a superhero.) Lauer quizzes each of the mole women on how they fell prey to the cult in the first place. “The reverend had bought some of my hair on Craigslist, and we started emailing and I just thought he had some real good ideas,” says one. “I had waited on Reverend Richard at a York Steak House I worked at and one night he invited me out to his car to see some baby rabbits, and I didn’t want to be rude, so…here we are,” says another. “I’m always amazed at what women will do because they are afraid of being rude,” Lauer deadpans. (Lauer deserves a Guest Actor Emmy nod for this scene, and that’s no exaggeration.) The segment quickly ends, and the mole women are ushered out of the studio by a producer handing them gift bags and shouting, “Thank you, victims! Good luck!” And yet, in spite of all this crass treatment and negativity, Kimmy Schmidt decides to make a go of it. She’s going to stay in New York. There, basically, is your plot. A woman who literally hasn’t seen the light of day in 15 years is going to live, work, and create a life for herself in the harshest, most unforgiving city in the country. She’s more excited than Jessie Spano on caffeine pills, and barely even scared. Kemper imbues Kimmy with a sense of wonder that recalls Will Ferrell in Elf, Jennifer Garner in 13 Going on 30, and Tom Hanks in Big, but is a comedic tour de force in her own right.

She laughs at an automatic sink faucet turning on with the mad gaiety of Julia Roberts receiving pearls in Pretty Woman. She has candy for dinner and is generally confused by modern society, but in a curious and cute rather than scared kind of way. Obliviousness is a funny color on her, too. “Where is your grownup?” she asks a little boy after seeing him steal candy. “Are you alone? Or are you some kind of tiny businessman, sir?” The boy leads her to his mom, an Upper East Side narcissist named Jaqueline Voorhes, played by Fey’s 30 Rock secret weapon, Jane Krakowski (she’s just as lethal here). Jacqueline promptly hires Kimmy to be her son’s nanny, and proceeds to steal every scene she’s in with delicious one-liners sending up the vapid and needlessly opulent New York rich. It would be easy to draw comparisons between Krakowski’s self-involved Jacqueline on Kimmy Schmidt and Krakowski’s self-involved Jenna on 30 Rock, were it not for one obvious difference: Unlike Jenna, Jacqueline very clearly is not a terrible person. But then again, it would be easy to draw comparisons between much of Kimmy Schmidt and 30 Rock. Tonally, the shows look and feel are very similar. They both explore our cultural tics and skewer our oft-unintended self-centeredness. They both fire off zeitgeisty wordplay as if the actors are rapid-fire comedy rifles. And Kimmy’s sense of humor echoes that of 30 Rock’s: toeing the mainstream line, but living in that precarious wobble off-center. It’s what gives both shows their edge. But, more impressively, both put clever spins on the tired “single gal in the city” trope. The conceit should be dried up at this point, having perhaps wrung the last bit of cleverness out of it with Fey’s hapless Liz Lemon as the one trying to have it all. But seeing the world through Kimmy’s blindly optimistic eyes is a welcome counterpoint to the worn-down jadedness of Liz, and it’s a testament to Kemper’s performance that Kimmy’s pluckiness doesn’t seem retrograde, or grating. She’s not Pollyanna. She’s got a 'tude. She’s spunky and she’s defiant, which is why you have no doubt that she’s gonna make it after all. Her spirit fingers cheerleading her new lease on life have a high-functioning middle one, too, and it’s directed at anyone hell-bent on destroying her fresh opportunity. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was originally developed for NBC before the network eventually passed and it went to Netflix, reportedly because they found the whole thing to be too unusual for network TV. As the episodes progress and Titus Burgess, who plays Kimmy’s new roommate, and Carol Kane (!!!), who plays her new landlord, blossom into the kind of endearing kooks we’re used to Fey peppering her shows with, it’s easy to see why Netflix is the perfect home for the series. Who knows what kind of stereotypes NBC would have flattened their characters into, or even Krakowski’s for that matter? Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt doesn’t take advantage of the freedom of Netflix to ramp up nudity or profanity or moral depravity, as other series do. Instead it uses the creative breathing room to dial up and embrace the show’s inherent weirdness—this is a comedy about a cult survivor, after all—and then have the luxury to bring things back to a relatable, human level again. As a sum of its parts, this series shouldn’t need a ringing endorsement to pique anyone’s interest in it. (Hello, this is a comedy from Tina Fey and starring the trio of Ellie Kemper, Jane Krakowski, and Carol Kane. They could be watching paint dry and we’d all be on board.) Nonetheless, it can’t be oversold how big a win this is for Fey and Carlock, who prove themselves just as adept at characterizing a protagonist’s joie de vivre as they are at crafting a woman content with merely working on her night cheese. Going the route of happy when everyone else is veering dark, they’ve solidified themselves as not just bravura comedy writers—which we already knew they were—but industry risk-takers, too. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The articles discuss \\"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\\" a comedy developed for Netflix by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock.

Several of the younger children ran to her as she came in, and stood holding fast to the folds of her black habit, staring up at the strangers, while she explained the kind of instruction given, the system, and the order reigning in each department. Finally, she persuaded a little girl, only six years old, to take her dusky face out of the long flowing veil of the nun, and show how quickly she could read a sentence that Sister Winifred wrote on the blackboard. Then others were called on, and gave examples of their accomplishments in easy arithmetic and spelling.

Movie title: The First Grader Context: In 2003, a disc jockey announces over a Kenyan radio station that the government is offering free primary school education to all natives who can prove citizenship with a birth certificate. Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the Mau Mau Uprising against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Marugeâs education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility. Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Marugeâs case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback...","completion":"Kimani Maruge is in the Guinness Book of World Records because he holds the world record for being the oldest person to start primary school. Born in 1920, Maruge decided to pursue an education at the age of 84, after the Kenyan government announced free primary education for all citizens in 2003. This incredible and inspiring story is portrayed in the movie \\"The First Grader,\\" directed by Justin Chadwick. In the movie, Maruge, played by Oliver Litondo, approaches the local school principal, Jane Obinchu (played by Naomie Harris), and expresses his desire to learn how to read. Despite facing ridicule and opposition from fellow teachers and education officials, Maruge is determined to continue his education. The movie showcases the various challenges he faces as an elderly student and the impact of his decision on the community, his fellow students, and the education system as a whole. Maruge's pursuit of education at his age captured the attention of the national and international media, highlighting the importance of literacy and education regardless of age, background, or life circumstances. His courage and determination to fight for education despite various setbacks led his story to be acknowledged by the Guinness Book of World Records and inspired many people around the world. In real life, Maruge's perseverance in pursuing an education at an advanced age had a profound impact on the Kenyan community and demonstrated the importance of equal opportunities in education, without age barriers. His story emphasizes the transformative power of education and the universal right of everyone to access quality education at any stage of life.

The Times was founded by publisher John Walter on 1 January 1785 as The Daily Universal Register, with Walter in the role of editor.

Being unemployed, Walter decided to set a new business up. It was in that time when Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was faster and more precise (three years later, it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said). Walter bought the logography's patent and to use it, he decided to open a printing house, where he would daily produce an advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain was 1 January 1785.

Please answer this question: Who was the captain of the French Team that won the FIFA World Cup on home soil in 1998?","completion":"The captain of the French national team that won the FIFA World Cup on home soil in 1998 was Didier Deschamps. Born on October 15, 1968, in Bayonne, France, Deschamps had an esteemed career as a footballer, primarily playing as a defensive midfielder. His excellent tactical understanding, leadership skills, and tenacity on the field earned him the nickname \\"the water carrier\\" from his fellow teammates. Deschamps began his professional career with Nantes, where he played from 1985 to 1989. He then moved to Olympique de Marseille, where he enjoyed tremendous success, winning two French league titles (1990 and 1992) and captained the team to its first UEFA Champions League title in the 1992-1993 season. In 1994, Didier Deschamps joined Juventus in Italy. During his five-year stint with the club, he won three Serie A titles (1995, 1997, and 1998), one Coppa Italia (1995), one Italian Super Cup (1995), as well as one UEFA Champions League (1996) and one UEFA Super Cup (1996). Deschamps earned his first international cap for France in 1989. Eventually, he was named captain of the national team, leading Les Bleus during the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The tournament was special for the French team, as they hosted the event and were considered strong contenders. With a talented squad boasting players like Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, Marcel Desailly, and Lilian Thuram, the French team was a force to be reckoned with. Under Deschamps' leadership, France advanced through the group stages and the knockout rounds with relative ease. In the final, they faced defending champions Brazil, who had stars such as Ronaldo, Rivaldo, and Cafu. Surprising many, France secured an emphatic 3-0 victory, with Zinedine Zidane scoring twice, and Emmanuel Petit adding the third goal. The 1998 World Cup triumph cemented Didier Deschamps' legacy as a standout captain and midfielder, and he retired from international football a year later. His distinguished playing career concluded in 2001 after two seasons with Valencia and a final season at Chelsea. Deschamps' success continued in his coaching career, which kicked off in 2001 with AS Monaco. He later managed Juventus, Olympique de Marseille, and currently, the French national team. Under his guidance, France finished as runners-up at the 2016 UEFA European Championship and then went on to win the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, making Deschamps only the third individual to have won the World Cup both as a player and a manager."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. In which case wildebeests would have lower risk of attack from the lions, case A or case B? Kenya's Masai Mara wildebeest migration is one of the greatest spectacles in the natural world. Every year thousands of wildebeests cross the Mara river. John went to see the migration last year. He noticed that the wildebeests crossed the the river in a very large group. He noted that as case A. His guide told him that is not the case in other times of the year. The wildebeests cross the river in smaller groups in other times. John noted that as case B. The guide added that in both cases on thing is constant, they are attacked by the lions. Hint: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's go through the information step-by-step. 1.

Analyzing this information, we can conclude that the dilution effect would benefit the wildebeests in Case A, where they cross the river in a very large group.

She studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John, and successfully auditioned for Sujoy Ghosh's fantasy film Aladin (2009) her acting debut. She played the love interest of Riteish Deshmukh's character, a role based on the character of Princess Jasmine. and Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN felt that she was: \\"easy on the eyes and appears confident but has precious little to do\\". Although the film was a critical and commercial failure, she won the IIFA Award for Star Debut of the Year - Female. In 2010, Fernandez appeared opposite Deshmukh in the science fiction romantic comedy Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai. She was cast as a girl from Venus, who lands on Earth in search of love. The film, along with Fernandez's performance, received poor reviews; Rediff.com's Sukanya Verma noted: \\"She gamely makes a fool of herself whilst aping the actions of movie stars, ranging from Sridevi's Naagin dance, Mithun Chakravarthy's Disco Dancer moves, to Big B's violent headshake in Hum. Her Tara could be a keeper if only Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai wasn't so intent on turning her into a love-struck Barbie.\\" Critic Anupama Chopra also criticized Fernandez, calling her \\"a pin-prick on a balloon\\". Later that year, she made a special appearance in the song \\"Dhanno\\" for Sajid Khan's comedy Housefull. Mahesh Bhatt's thriller Murder 2 was Fernandez's first commercial success and marked a turning point in her career. She took on the role of Priya, a lonely model who is in a confused relationship with Arjun Bhagwat (played by Emraan Hashmi). Fernandez was praised for her performance, and for the boldness and sex appeal she displayed in the film. Gaurav Malini of The Times of India stated that she was \\"tastefully tempting\\" but noted that her romance with Hashmi was \\"literally half-baked\\". The following year, Fernandez appeared in the ensemble comedy Housefull 2 alongside Akshay Kumar, John Abraham, and Asin.

Given the background: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.) and the situation: John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude. Answer the following question: Would fork A needed John to move it more or less quickly than fork B?

Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. Paragraph: Bill was studying the states of matter. First, he selected a matter with low boiling point. He labeled it as matter A. To compare it with a well-known matter he selected water. He labeled it as matter B. He also selected ice, which he labeled as matter C. He is now better prepared to compare their states.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

Believe it or not, climbing is said to be about 75% legs and only 25% arms. To climb efficiently and successfully, a person needs to have a wonderful technique. One of the major rules of rock climbing is to always have three points touching the wall, whether it is both feet and one hand, or one foot and both hands, as it is much easier to have your weight cases will not do the climbing; they only hold you into the wall so that your legs are actually pushing you upward. Also, the closer you are to the wall, the easier it is to climb. Rock climbing may sound a bit too extreme for the everyday person, but it is really an amazing workout. Once you get into the sport, and learn how to position your body and rest your weight, then you can begin to deal with some difficult problems. The great thing about rock climbing is that it is mentally challenging as well. You are constantly analyzing the way your body moves and how to do certain moves on the wall. For anyone who wants to get into shape, rock climbing is a fun and effective way to exercise muscles. While climbing, it is much easier for a rock climber if he _ .

If your dorm room is particularly cramped, use a tape measure to get the length, width, and height of both the room itself and each of your major furniture items. Doing this can help you better visualize the maximum amount of space you have. Can we draw the following conclusion? If your dorm room is particularly cramped, use a tape measure just to get the length, width, and height of the room itself. Choose from: *Yes; *It's impossible to say; *No;","completion":"No, we cannot draw that conclusion. In the given information, it is mentioned to measure not only the length, width, and height of the room but also the major furniture items. This crucial step helps you better visualize the space and create an effective layout plan for the dorm room. When arranging dorm room furniture, there are several steps to follow in order to create a comfortable and functional living space: 1. Measure your room and furniture: As mentioned earlier, it's important to measure the length, width, and height of both the room itself and each of your major furniture items (bed, desk, dresser, etc.). This will give you the exact dimensions and help you avoid overcrowding the room. 2. Create a floor plan: With the measurements in hand, either draw out a floor plan on graph paper or use a free online room planning tool to make a digital version. This will help you identify the best locations for your furniture and ensure that everything fits comfortably in the limited space. 3. Consider traffic flow and functionality: Keep in mind that you need to move freely through the room, accessing all furniture items without any obstacles. Consider where you'll get dressed, study, and sleep, and place furniture accordingly. 4. Optimize vertical space: To fully utilize the small space in a dorm room, use shelves, storage bins, and hanging organizers to make the most of the room's height. Wall-mounted shelves, bunk beds, and lofted beds can provide storage and free up floor space. 5. Create distinct zones: It's helpful to distinguish separate areas for study, sleep, and socialization. Arrange the furniture to create boundaries between various functions, which will make the room feel more intuitive and less cluttered. 6. Use multi-purpose furniture: Space-saving solutions such as futons, folding desks, and ottoman storage can serve multiple purposes and minimize the amount of space taken up by furniture. 7. Enhance the room's ambiance with lighting: Lighting can make a significant difference in the overall feel of the room. Make sure the desk has a good task light, and consider using floor lamps or string lights to create a cozy atmosphere. In conclusion, to arrange dorm room furniture effectively, it is necessary to carefully measure both the room and the furniture pieces, in addition to considering traffic flow, optimizing vertical space, and creating distinct zones while placing each item. This approach will ensure a comfortable, functional, and cohesive living space in a cramped dorm room."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paragraph: On 1 June 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics announced a proposed “Significant New Use Rule” (SNUR) for asbestos, a mineral once widely used in the construction of buildings due to its flame-retardant properties but now uncontroversially considered a carcinogen. The necessity for such a rule, in general, stems from the fact that not all uses of asbestos are currently banned; some of them remain unregulated thanks to a 1991 court ruling. The asbestos uses the 2018 SNUR applies to are ones that had not been banned by earlier regulations and remained in active use at the time of the 1991 court ruling, but are no longer in use due to users’ desires to avoid contracting cancer or liability for causing cancer in others. The EPA refers to these uses as “currently unregulated former uses.” SNURs are a mechanism within the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that mandate specific EPA approval when a chemical is used in a significantly new way or in a significantly new mixture that “might create concerns.”: For asbestos, [the] EPA is proposing a SNUR for certain uses of asbestos (including asbestos-containing goods) that would require manufacturers and importers to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos. This review process would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use of asbestos and, when necessary, take action to prohibit or limit the use. The TSCA is currently undergoing a major overhaul that began under the Obama administration and was reinterpreted in radically divergent ways under the Trump administration. When former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt (a Trump appointee who resigned amid accusations of misconduct) explained the proposed SNUR for asbestos, he described it as part of an “unprecedented” set of new protections against the dangers of asbestos which require manufacturers “to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos”. In their correspondence with us, the EPA stated that the proposed rule serves “to ensure that the manufacture, import, or processing for the currently unregulated former uses of asbestos identified in the rule are prohibited unless reviewed and approved by EPA.” According to critics, the problem with this position is twofold. The first problem concerns the way in which the current EPA has written the SNUR, which EPA staffers have privately worried does not allow for the ban of all currently inactive unregulated uses but instead only concerns 15 specific uses the EPA “believes” to be comprehensive and thus could allow for the continued legality of some now dormant uses. The second problem concerns the way in which the EPA has proposed to evaluate the risk of these “currently unregulated former uses”. In May 2018, the EPA published a document known as the “Problem Formulation of the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos,” which establishes the scientific approach the EPA will take in evaluating these new uses. Significantly, their approach will not include information from existing (or “legacy”) uses of asbestos, despite the significant body of work around health risks stemming from those uses: In the case of asbestos, legacy uses, associated disposals, and legacy disposals will be excluded from the problem formulation and risk evaluation … These include asbestos containing materials that remain in older buildings or are part of older products but for which manufacture, processing and distribution in commerce are not currently intended, known or reasonably foreseen. EPA is excluding these activities because EPA generally interprets the mandates under section TSCA § 6(a)-(b) to conduct risk evaluations and any corresponding risk management to focus on uses for which manufacture, processing or distribution is intended, known to be occurring, or reasonably foreseen, rather than reaching back to evaluate the risks associated with legacy uses, associated disposal, and legacy disposal, and interprets the definition of conditions of use in that context. E&E News reported that this approach may serve to severely limit the types of exposures the EPA will consider when formulating the potential risk of new uses for asbestos: Public health advocates believe EPA is inappropriately limiting its health reviews of chemicals to avoid considering the impacts of those already in the environment. But the agency hasn’t been swayed by their pushback … That means the agency won’t consider the dangers posed by, for example, asbestos-containing tiles, adhesives and piping in millions of homes and commercial buildings nationwide. According to the New York Times, the new rules will serve to narrow the ways in which asbestos itself is defined as well: Other changes identified in the E.P.A. documents narrow the definitions of certain chemicals, including asbestos. Some asbestos-like fibers will not be included in the risk assessments, one agency staff member said, nor will the 8.8 million pounds a year of asbestos deposited in hazardous landfills or the 13.1 million pounds discarded in routine dump sites. Three former EPA officials, including the former supervisor of the toxic chemical program, told the New York Times that such stipulations would necessarily create flawed analyses of the threat posed by any chemical currently being re-evaluated by the EPA: Three former agency officials, including a former supervisor of the toxic chemical program, said that the E.P.A.’s approach would result in a flawed analysis of the threat presented by chemicals. “It is ridiculous,” said Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, who retired last year after nearly four decades at the E.P.A., where she ran the toxic chemical unit during her last year. “You can’t determine if there is an unreasonable risk without doing a comprehensive risk evaluation” … The most likely outcome of the changes will be that the agency finds lower levels of risks associated with many chemicals, and as a result, imposes fewer new restrictions or prohibitions, several current and former agency officials said. Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico, argued that former EPA head Scott Pruitt was undermining a bipartisan push to reform the TSCA that began under President Obama. “Congress worked hard in bipartisan fashion to reform our nation’s broken chemical safety laws, but Pruitt’s E.P.A. is failing to put the new law to use as intended,” he said in a statement. President Trump spoke on the topic of asbestos long before his election to the White House. In his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback, Trump argued that the chemical is actually safe once applied and suggested that the link to health problems was manufactured by mob-connected companies which perform asbestos removal: “I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented.” While it is true that the uses of asbestos discussed in the 2018 SNUR are currently legal, their health and litigation risks have rendered them effectively dead. The current administration has established a process for some of those uses to be granted formal approval by the EPA if they pass a safety review many scientists find flawed. For these reasons, we concur with the leaked opinion of EPA lawyer Mark Seltzer, an attorney advisor to the EPA Chemical Risk and Reporting Enforcement Branch who worked on the SNUR and concluded that: “This new approach allows asbestos-containing products that are not currently used to be used in the future.” Claim: The Environmental Protection Agency will allow new asbestos products to enter the market.","completion":"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposed \\"Significant New Use Rule\\" (SNUR) for asbestos in June 2018. The rule applies to asbestos uses that were not banned by earlier regulations and are currently unregulated. Under the rule, manufacturers and importers would have to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, importing, or processing of asbestos. Critics argue that the SNUR has two main problems: it does not allow for the ban of all currently inactive unregulated uses and the EPA's proposed method to evaluate the risks of these uses will not include information from existing uses of asbestos. The current administration has established a process for some of these asbestos uses to be granted formal approval by the EPA if they pass a safety review that many scientists find flawed. Thus, the claim that the EPA will allow new asbestos products to enter the market is supported by the proposed rule and the concerns raised by critics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: People who speak or perform before the public sometimes may suffer from \\"Stage Fright. \\" Stage fright makes a person nervous. In the worst case it can make one's mind go back and forget what one ought to say, or to act. Actors, musicians, dancers, lawyers, even radio show hosts have suffered from stage fright at one time or another. Diana Nichols is an expert in helping people free from stage fright at a medical centre in New York City. She helps actors learn to control themselves. Miss Nichols says some people have always been afraid to perform before the audience. Others, she says, develop stage fright after a fearful experience. She offers them ways to control the fear. One way is to smile before going onto the stage. Taking two deep breaths also helps. Deep breathing helps you get control of your body. Miss Nichols persuades her patients to tell themselves that their speech or performance does not have to the perfect. It's all right to make a mistake. She tells them they should not be too cautious while they are performing. It is important that they should continue to perform while she is helping them. After each performance, they discuss what happened and find out what advice helped and what did not. As they perform more and more, they will fear less and less as much as 50%. Miss Nichols says the aim is only to reduce stage fright, not to _ it completely. This is because a little stage fright makes a person more cautious, and improves the performance.

They need to find the reasons for this phenomenon. Would group B have single reduced pigment or multiple reduced pigment? A:","completion":"To determine whether group B (Siberian Tigers with albinism) would have single reduced pigment or multiple reduced pigments, I will go through the following steps: Step 1: Understand the definitions of albinism and leucism Step 2: Analyze the basis and effects of albinism Step 3: Determine the type of pigment reduction in group B Step 1: Albinism is a genetic condition where an animal has little or no melanin, the pigment responsible for coloration in skin, hair, and eyes. Leucism is a partial loss of pigmentation that results in white or pale patches on the animal's body. Unlike albinism, leucistic animals can still produce melanin, albeit in reduced amounts. Step 2: Albinism is caused by a mutation in one of several genes responsible for the production of melanin. This leads to a complete or near-complete absence of the pigment, causing the animal to have a white or extremely light-colored appearance. The lack of pigmentation mainly affects the melanin pigment. Step 3: Since the primary basis of albinism is a lack of melanin pigment, it would be appropriate to conclude that group B (Siberian Tigers with albinism) would have a single reduced pigment (melanin) as opposed to multiple reduced pigments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles. - Olive Marie Osmond (born October 13, 1959) is an American singer, actress, doll designer, and a member of the show business family the Osmonds. Although she was never part of her family's singing group, she gained success as a solo country music artist in the 1970s and 1980s. Her best known song is a cover of the country pop ballad \\"Paper Roses\\". From 1976 to 1979, she and her singer brother Donny Osmond hosted the television variety show \\"Donny & Marie\\". - · \\"Paper Roses\\" is a popular song written and composed by Fred Spielman and Janice Torre. It first was a top five hit in 1960 for Anita Bryant with Monty Kelly's Orchestra and Chorus. Marie Osmond later covered it in 1973 and took her version to number one on the US country chart. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.

Summarize: That's how Chris Pratt has reacted publicly after being linked to the role of Indiana Jones in a possible reboot of the legendary franchise. Everything is speculation at the moment, but the star is now one of the go-to men for blockbuster producers. The Jurassic World actor was speaking as he picked up the Hasty Pudding Man of the Year award at Harvard University. The award is presented annually by America's oldest undergraduate troupe to famous actors and actresses. Responding to the Indiana rumours, he said that he knew as much as anybody else but that it would be awesome to play the role - made famous by Harrison Ford and River Phoenix. As part of the Hasty Pudding ceremony - where the university acting society honours big stars - winners are treated to a traditional comedy roast. He was teased about some of his earlier TV and film roles, including a 2009 comedy he made with Kim Kardashian called Deep In The Valley. The Hasty Pudding troupe said that audiences asked for refunds after watching it. Pratt responded: \\"Joke's on you. It didn't even open in theatres.\\" As if he hadn't shown off his genial, funny and all-round-nice-guy personality enough already, he'd visited a children's cancer centre in Boston earlier in the day. The reason? He was fulfilling the Super Bowl bet he made with fellow actor Chris Evans. Pratt's a Seattle Seahawks fan, whilst Evans supports the New England Patriots. The two stars agreed that whoever's team lost the Super Bowl would visit the other's chosen charity, dressed as the superhero they're known for playing. As the Seahawks lost, Pratt got his Guardians Of The Galaxy Star-Lord leather jacket on and surprised the children at Christopher's Haven in Boston.

Given the question: Several months ago I decided it would be wise to look into the possibilities of buying a life insurance policy , because I understood it might be a good investment. I got the name of an insurance agent from a friend and called the agent to get some information. From the kinds of questions I put to him the agent could tell that I knew nothing about insurance, so he kindly offered to explore the matter with me in more detail---to help me determine the kind of policy I ought to be considering. That evening he appeared at my door promptly at 7:30; without wasting time on pleasantness, he spread his papers out on the kitchen table and launched into a lengthy explanation. I listened attentively as he talked about the difference between various types of policies, and he explained the kind of coverage he felt I ought to have. Toward the end of the evening (after three or four hours of talking), he kindly helped me fill out an application for a 50,000 policy, and then he asked if I could go to a Dr. Luther's office on Friday for a physical examination. I don't know why, but it was not until the mention of the doctor's appointment that I realized fully what was happening. I was about to sign a lifetime contract, yet I had not really made a decision about whether I wanted to buy the policy. However, since he had spent so much time with me, I didn't want to make him feel that he had wasted his time. So I invented an excuse about things I had to do on Friday, and I assured him I would call him in a few days. Actually, I had no intention of going to see Dr. Luther or of calling the agent again.

Answer:","completion":"Ambassadors to Britain are officially accredited to the Court of St. James's. The Court of St. James's is a term that refers to the royal court for the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. The name is derived from St. James's Palace, which was a primary residence of Kings and Queens of England from the time of Henry VIII until the reign of Queen Victoria. Even though the court's location has physically moved to Buckingham Palace, the name \\"Court of St. James's\\" has endured and is still used in a formal and official manner. While the Queen now lives in Buckingham Palace, St. James's Palace is still used for official functions and remains the senior palace of the Sovereign. Ambassadors to the UK are formally known as \\"Ambassadors to the Court of St. James's\\" because their official duties involve interacting with the British monarchy, and the Court of St. James's is the institutional representation of the monarchy. Their letters of credence, which are formal diplomatic letters that confirm their official status, are also addressed to the Court of St. James's. An ambassador's role is to represent their home country in the host country, promoting friendly relations and cooperation between the two nations. In this case, an ambassador to Britain would represent their home government in dealings with the UK government, negotiate agreements, report back to their home country on significant political, social, and economic developments in the UK, support their compatriots abroad, and promote culture, education, and trade links between the UK and their home country. In their role, ambassadors must navigate the delicate balance of maintaining and improving relations between the two countries while also advancing the interests of their own nation. Given the central role the Queen plays in Britain's government and the significant influence she wields in the nation, much of an ambassador's work is focused on engagements with the monarchy, and by extension, the Court of St. James's."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why was there a fusion of Greek culture with those of areas the Greeks colonized. Context: After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world. Answer:","completion":"The fusion of Greek culture with those of areas the Greeks colonized occurred because Hellenistic kingdoms were established in various regions following Alexander the Great's ventures.

Sometime in the past, Arctor was abandoned by his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend their days intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a \\"scramble suit\\" that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and he is known only by the code name \\"Fred.\\" Arctor's senior officer, \\"Hank\\", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other. Since going undercover, Arctor himself has become addicted to Substance D and he has befriended the main woman he has been spying on: a cocaine addict and Substance D supplier named Donna. Arctor hopes to purchase large enough quantities of Substance D from Donna that she is forced to introduce him to her own supplier, but he has also developed seemingly unrequited romantic feelings towards her. At work, Hank orders Arctor to step up surveillance on Donna and her associates; however, Arctor's house is now at the center of his own investigation, since this is where Donna and the other addicts in her and Arctor's life now spend most of their time. Hank names Bob Arctor as the suspected ringleader, and thus orders Arctor to spy on himself. Arctor, therefore, has to even more carefully plan his double life, though his prolonged use of Substance D is damaging his brain, causing him to sometimes forget his...

News article: Adam's story: When prescription drugs are deadly Watch CNN's special series, \\"Deadly Fix,\\" this week on CNN Newsroom at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ET. (CNN) -- The modest clinic on Milpas Street in laid-back Santa Barbara, California, was well known to patients seeking powerful pain medication. They went there to find the \\"Candy Man.\\" Dr. Julio Diaz earned that nickname because, according to court records, he was writing prescriptions for massive numbers of pills -- hundreds, even thousands, at a time. He prescribed medications like oxycodone, a powerful opioid pain killer that is highly addictive. At the nearby Cottage Hospital, emergency room doctors noticed a pattern and sensed a problem. \\"We communicate first with our patients and then with the primary care providers. We then began to see that there was a pattern and that clearly by far Dr. Diaz's prescribing stood out above any of the other physicians in the computer,\\" Dr. Chris Lambert said. Lambert found that Cottage Health documented more than 400 emergency room visits from Diaz's patients, according to court documents. Some were clearly dependent on opiates, he said, and others were seeking more pain medication. \\"And of course we saw the complications, too,\\" Lambert noted. Those complications included symptoms of severe drug withdrawal and overdoses. The Medical Board of California, and eventually the Drug Enforcement Administration, were called to investigate. That investigation resulted in a laundry list of charges against Diaz including the over-prescription of narcotics, prescribing narcotics when there was no medical need, and illegal distribution of a narcotic to a person under the age of 21. According to the DEA, there were a dozen overdose deaths associated with Diaz. Twenty-seven-year-old Adam Montgomery was one of them. Montgomery started seeing Diaz after he injured his back on a construction job. He was seeking pain medication. He got it, and soon he was hooked. As the months went by, Montgomery's parents noticed a change. \\"Well, at some point, he started spending a lot of time in bed. And just watching TV, never doing anything,\\" Adam's father, Robert Montgomery said. \\"And that seemed to get worse and worse. And then I noticed the color change in his face, his attitude, his love toward his family ...That all went away.\\" Montgomery slowly became aware that his son was addicted to oxycodone, and he called Diaz. \\"I was seeing paperwork with hundreds of oxycodone pills,\\" Montgomery told CNN. \\"I wanted to know why he was giving him so many.\\" He says he never got an answer. In an affidavit, the DEA alleges that in the six weeks before Adam Montgomery's death, Diaz prescribed him a total of 2,087 pills, an average of 63 pills a day. On the day after Thanksgiving in 2011, Montgomery received the news that his son had died of a drug overdose. In Adam Montgomery's bedroom and car, investigators found bottles of multiple drugs, and some were empty. All were prescribed by Diaz. The autopsy concluded that a cocktail of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and methadone was the cause of death. \\"Right now we have more people that are dying from prescription opioids than cocaine and heroin combined,\\" said Robert Hill, a DEA special agent with years of experience on the front lines of the war on drugs. Hill says that in 2011, the most recent year for which there are statistics, more than 22,000 people died from prescription drugs. Late last year, Diaz signed a plea agreement, admitting to a reduced number of charges. Those charges include the illegal distribution of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and fentanyl. The original charges against him carried a maximum sentence of 200 years in prison and up to 10 million in fines, but the plea bargain will likely reduce that sentence. CNN contacted Diaz's attorney, but received no comment. Diaz awaits sentencing. To this day, Montgomery's parents struggle with the what-ifs. Had he known then what he knows now, \\"I might have been able to save him, but I was more disappointed in him -- in making these bad decisions,\\" Robert Montgomery said. \\"But it wasn't him, it was the drugs that changed him. So I just turned my back on him, and I wouldn't do that today.\\" READ: DEA probing alleged prescription drug abuse in NFL, source says How safe are your prescription drugs?

Dr. Julio Diaz, a doctor at a clinic on Milpas Street in Santa Barbara, California, was notorious for prescribing large numbers of highly addictive painkillers like oxycodone, earning him the nickname \\"Candy Man.\\" 2. Dr. Chris Lambert and other emergency room doctors at Cottage Hospital noticed a problematic pattern. They found that their ER had received more than 400 visits from Diaz's patients. These patients were either clearly dependent on opiates or seeking more pain medication. 3. The Medical Board of California, along with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), were involved in an investigation into Diaz. This resulted in multiple charges against him, including over-prescribing narcotics, prescribing narcotics without medical need, and illegal distribution of narcotics to someone under 21. 4. Adam Montgomery, a 27-year-old patient of Diaz, died due to an overdose. Montgomery began visiting Diaz after a back injury on a construction site and soon was addicted to the medication Diaz prescribed to him. 5. In the six weeks leading up to Montgomery's death, Diaz prescribed him a total of 2,087 pills, which averages 63 pills a day. The cause of Montgomery's death was concluded to be a cocktail of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and methadone. 6. According to the DEA, in 2011, more than 22,000 people died from prescription drugs - an issue more severe than cocaine and heroin combined. 7. Diaz admitted to a reduced number of charges in a plea agreement. The original charges would have resulted in a sentence of up to 200 years in prison and 10M in fines; however, the plea bargain will likely reduce this sentence. He awaits sentencing. 8. The aftermath of the situation left Montgomery's parents regretting if they could have done more to prevent their son's death. They were disappointed in Adam's bad decisions which they later realized were due to his drug addiction. 9. The article considers the broader issue of prescription drug safety and links to related topics and articles hinting at a wider issue of prescription drug abuse. These points encapsulate the overarching narrative of the tragic consequences of prescription drug overuse, the role of a lenient doctor in contributing to this, and the larger societal impact and issues of prescription drug misuse and the legal repercussions followed."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Whose car is the person from the convenience store driving? from the following article ? Jack and Kate, who have been together since college, are at JFK Airport, where Jack is about to leave to take up a twelve-month internship with Barclays in London. Kate fears the separation will be fatal for their relationship and asks him not to go, but he reassures her, saying their love is strong enough to last, and he flies out. The scene fades out to \\"13 years later\\": Jack is now an unmarried Wall Street executive in New York City, living a carefree bachelor's life. At work, he is putting together a multi-billion dollar merger and has ordered an emergency meeting on Christmas Day. In his office, on Christmas Eve, he gets a message to contact Kate, but, even though he remembers her, he dismisses it, apparently uninterested. On his way home, he is in a convenience store when a young man, Cash, enters claiming to have a winning lottery ticket worth 238, but the store clerk refuses him, saying the ticket is a forgery. Cash pulls out a gun and threatens him, so Jack offers to buy the ticket and Cash eventually agrees. Outside, Jack tries to help Cash, to which he responds by asking Jack if anything is missing from his life. Jack says he has everything he needs, whereupon Cash enigmatically remarks that Jack has brought upon himself what is now going to happen, and walks away. A puzzled Jack returns to his penthouse and sleeps. On Christmas Day, Jack wakes up in a suburban New Jersey bedroom with Kate and two children. He rushes out to his condo and office in New York, but both doormen refuse him entrance and do not recognize him. Jack runs out into the street and encounters Cash driving Jack's Ferrari.

Sentence 1: But the Woodward case--his second Trial of the Decade--reflects Scheck's high-mindedness as much as his greed. This sentence tells us that the Woodward case is Scheck's second Trial of the Decade. It gives information about the nature of the case and Scheck's involvement. Sentence 2: Scheck would have many more trials. This sentence states that Scheck will have many more trials in the future. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the two sentences: - Sentence 1 discusses a specific case: the Woodward case, which is Scheck's second Trial of the Decade. - Sentence 2 states that Scheck would have many more trials in the future, without specifying the number of trials or their possible significance. Given the information provided in Sentence 1 about the Woodward case being Scheck's second Trial of the Decade, we cannot directly conclude that Sentence 2 is true or false since it does not provide enough details about the number or significance of Scheck's future trials.

I wasn't sure if I was ready, but I knew one thing: I wanted to get it over with. SAT for the students is like tooth pulling. For those smart Asian kiddos, it's like walking through the park: easy and carefree. _ As I arrived outside of the dining hall, already a mob of students were sitting, talking, or standing silently waiting to get in. Jones students are lucky not only to have such a testing center at school, but also the feeling of their home school where it feels comfortable and familiar. \\"ID, please,\\" my former math teacher asked at the door. \\"Okay.\\" She looked over my ID, checked off my name on her list, and pointed towards the dining hall tables inside. With hesitation, I picked up my feet and was directed to a large round table in the middle of the dinning hall. At least fourteen people could sit at this table but only four were allowed to take their test here. \\"I'm glad it's multiple choices.\\" I heard one student say. All the questions on the test have five choices except for one math section where they have only four. If you get an answer wrong, you don't get any point, plus you get a penalty of a 1/4 point. If you don't answer a question, you don't get any point, nor penalties. When everyone had a seat and the actual SAT I booklet in front of them, the proctor of the test called for our attentions. \\"In front of you, you should have a SAT I test and a scantron .

Context: My partner’s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister’s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister. I think the experience made us both content to elope. Question: Who made the wooden box? Answer: Pick your answer from: [1]. My partner's parents; [2]. not enough information; [3].

It is bordered to the west by the province of Ontario, James Bay, and Hudson Bay; to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay; to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and to the south by the province of New Brunswick and the US states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest administrative division; only the territory of Nunavut is larger. It is historically and politically considered to be part of Central Canada (with Ontario). Quebec is the second-most populous province of Canada, after Ontario. It is the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City, the capital. Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area, including the Island of Montreal. English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais, Eastern Townships, and Gaspé regions. The Nord-du-Québec region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples. The climate around the major cities is four-season continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers, but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions.

Similar to Sentence 1, the subject of the sentence is the same, and the main concern revolves around the suitability of the recommendation. In conclusion, the primary message of both sentences is the person's concern about the appropriateness of a recommendation. Thus, we can infer that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. However, it's essential to keep the slight nuances in mind, as Sentence 1 leans more towards a pondering or contemplating nature, while Sentence 2 is more about actively seeking answers or clarification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust? A Late Preclassic tomb has been excavated, believed to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial 1; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring 1 by 2 metres (3.3 by 6.6 ft), which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100–200.In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed K'utz Chman (\\"Grandfather Vulture\\" in Mam) by archaeologists, a sacred king or \\"big chief\\" who \\"bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America,\\" according to Miguel Orrego.

Would \\"Electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms , cells , large molecules , biopsy samples, metals , and crystals .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the given answer is not reasonable, as it does not address the question about microscopes that do not require a vacuum. Electron microscopes, as mentioned in the provided answer, actually require a vacuum for their operation. A more appropriate answer would be: Microscopes that do not require a vacuum primarily include light (optical) microscopes which use visible light and lenses to magnify specimens. There are different types of light microscopes, such as: 1. Compound Light Microscope: A type of microscope that uses multiple lenses to magnify the specimen, allowing for higher magnification (up to 2000x). It is widely used in biology, chemistry, and medicine to study cells, tissues, and microorganisms. 2. Stereo Microscope (Dissecting Microscope): This type of microscope uses two separate optical paths to provide a 3D image of the specimen. It is used for observing larger specimens like insects, plants, and other small objects, with lower magnification (up to 100x). 3. Fluorescence Microscope: Fluorescence microscopy takes advantage of the fluorescent properties of some molecules. It uses specific wavelengths of light to excite the fluorescent molecules, which then emit light of a different wavelength. This type of microscope is useful for identifying and visualizing specific structures within a sample. 4. Phase Contrast Microscope: This microscope enhances contrast in transparent or unstained samples by manipulating light waves passing through the specimen. It is particularly useful for studying live cells, including bacteria, and internal cell structures. 5. Darkfield Microscope: In this microscope, the specimen appears brightly lit against a dark background. It is well-suited for observing unstained, transparent samples that do not produce much contrast under regular brightfield microscopy. 6. Polarizing Microscope: Polarizing microscopes utilize polarized light to examine birefringent (double-refracting) materials such as minerals, plastics, crystals, and biological specimens like bone and muscle. While electron microscopes provide much higher magnification and resolution than light microscopes, they require a vacuum environment to prevent the scattering of electrons by air molecules. Light microscopes, on the other hand, can be used in standard atmospheric conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the company that departed Florence second? Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd of bison caused the Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.In early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons pulled by horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The name of the company that departed Florence second is the Martin Company, which left on August 27."},{"prompt":"Available choices: 1). proteins. 2). molecules. 3). passive particles. 4). solvent particles.

Input: The 22-year-old Iceland international is the first recruit for new Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas in a deal reported to be worth £8m. Sigurdsson was linked with a move to join former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool. He scored seven times in 19 games on loan under Rodgers at Swansea. Iceland manager Lars Lagerback told BBC World Service that Spurs had brought in a player with many attributes. \\"He understands the game. He's good with both feet. He's not a physical player or the best tackler, but he is very fit - I've met few so skilful players who can run so much for 90 minutes. You shouldn't underestimate him when it comes to the defensive part of the game.\\" Lars Lagerback, Iceland manager \\"He's a fantastic team player. He reads the game very well and I don't think you would find too many better link players,\\" he told the World Football programme. Sigurdsson was close to joining Swansea on a permanent basis before Rodgers left for Anfield, and his £6.8m transfer to the Liberty Stadium collapsed. Michael Laudrup, who succeeded Rodgers at Swansea, conceded defeat last month in his efforts to resurrect a deal. The move to Tottenham comes as speculation continues over the future of Spurs midfielder Luka Modric, who has been linked with a transfer to Manchester United or Real Madrid. Sigurdsson originally moved to England in October 2005 when he joined Reading's academy. He spent loan spells at Shrewsbury and Crewe before securing a regular place in the first team in the 2009-10 season when Rodgers managed the Royals. Sigurdsson won the player of the year award in his first full season at Reading, before being sold to Hoffenheim for a reported £6.5m fee at the start of the following campaign. He joined Swansea on loan in January and won the Premier League player of the month award for March.

Step 1: Combine the like terms on each side of the equation. 768*g - 1152*g = -384*g, as 768*g - 1152*g = (-1)*1152*g + 768*g = -384*g. Now, the equation becomes: -384*g = 1302*g - 20517 - 9831 Step 2: Combine the constants on the right side of the equation. 1302*g - 20517 - 9831 = 1302*g - 30348, as 20517 + 9831 = 30348. So, the equation now becomes: -384*g = 1302*g - 30348 Step 3: Move the -384*g term to the other side of the equation to get all the g terms together. Therefore, -384*g+384*g = 1302*g - 30348 + 384*g 0 = 1302*g + 384*g - 30348 Step 4: Simplify the equation by combining the g terms. 0 = 1686*g - 30348, as 1302*g + 384*g = 1686*g Step 5: Isolate the variable 'g' by adding 30348 to both sides. 30348 = 1686*g To find the value of 'g', divide both sides by 1686: g = 30348 / 1686 Step 6: Calculate the value of 'g'. g ≈ 18 So, the value of g is approximately 18."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost.

If I tell you that Water forms into liquid from the air, and ask you the question \\"what forms into liquid from the air?\\", is the correct answer \\"alcohol\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"alcohol.\\" Based on the information given, \\"water\\" forms into a liquid from the air. Water vapor in the air, also known as humidity or moisture, can turn into liquid because of a process called condensation. Condensation occurs when the water vapor in the air cools down and changes back into liquid form. This can happen, for example, when the air temperature drops overnight, leading to the formation of dew on surfaces like grass, car windows, or even spiderwebs. The misconception regarding \\"alcohol\\" may arise from the fact that alcohol and water can mix together and are found in many beverages, but alcohol does not form into a liquid from the air through the same process as water. Alcohol is a byproduct of fermentation – a chemical reaction that occurs when yeasts or bacteria break down sugars in the absence of oxygen. In the case of alcoholic beverages, fermentation typically occurs in natural sugars found in ingredients like grains or fruits and the process is controlled to obtain a specific alcohol content.

Article: Though apparently a little fuzzy on the subject of judicial review, President Barack Obama is supposed to be a constitutional scholar of some sort. On the subject of his decision yesterday to unilaterally enact sweeping changes to U.S. immigration policy on nothing but his own say-so, we would like to introduce Barack Obama to Barack Obama, who during a Univision interview just last year affirmed: “America is a nation of laws, which means I, as the president, am obligated to enforce the law. . . . There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president.” A little softness in the polls and one executive order later, the president has reversed himself. The president’s executive order will categorically prevent the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children. It will also grant them work authorizations to which they would not otherwise be entitled under law. The former is unwise and the latter is illegal. The federal executive branch, like a local district attorney or a traffic cop, has some discretion about how, when, and whether to prosecute certain violations of the law. Not every driver exceeding the speed limit by 4 mph will receive a ticket, and not every teenager caught shoplifting will face a criminal indictment. Police and prosecutors are granted some leeway in these matters — but they cannot change the speed limit or legalize theft. That requires an act of the legislature. By making the liberal use of this discretion mandatory, the Obama administration is in effect writing new law rather than enforcing existing law. The president’s executive order reflects in no small part changes contemplated by Senator Marco Rubio’s DREAM Act and similar legislative proposals, which would allow illegal immigrants brought to this country as children, through no culpability of their own, to remain in the United States and gain access to a process for legalizing their presence. We think that this is a defective proposal, but Senator Rubio may at least be credited with appreciating that changing the law of the land requires changing the law of the land, i.e. an act of Congress. The president does not possess the constitutional authority to do what he proposes to do. The executive may of course prioritize deportations. It is reasonable to invest more resources in deporting a narcotics cartel foot soldier than in chasing down high-school seniors who have been in the country for 99 percent of their lives. (Never mind, for the moment, the question of whether Homeland Security lacks sufficient resources to enforce the law across the board; if it did, the answer would be more resources for enforcement, something that the administration has not pursued with any vigor despite congressional solicitousness.) Prioritization is one thing; what the president does not have the power to do is to mandate across-the-board legal status for those low-priority illegals. We could, if we so chose, establish an amnesty process for legalizing those illegals we deem worthy of clemency, but to do so would require Congress to propose and enact legislation. In fact, several proposals have come up in Congress to do just that, and they have been uniformly rejected. The president’s executive order violates the constitutional separation of powers that defines the political architecture of our republic. If Congress allows this illegitimate executive order to stand, it will have in effect delegated its power to make law to the president. This executive order would, therefore, be entirely unacceptable even if it represented good policy. But it does not. Congress has been correct to reject earlier attempts at this sort of limited amnesty, and the American public is correct to remain generally skeptical of amnesty proposals. The amnesty proponents will of course point to any number of cases in which a young person is facing a painful situation through no fault of his own, and one would have to have a heart as hard as coffin nails not to sympathize, but the fact is that it was not the people of the United States who put these young people in legal jeopardy — it was their parents. Without first ensuring effective enforcement at the border and at the workplace, any step toward normalizing the status of those here in violation of the law invites more of the same abuse and disorder. Further, there exists no reliable mechanism for investigating when and how these illegal immigrants entered the country. Being undocumented, as the politically correct term has it, they have in many cases little or no evidence that they did not show up in the United States the day before yesterday in full knowledge that they were violating the law. Congress already has spoken on this amnesty proposal, and the answer was “No.” Even the president has to take no for an answer when the law requires him to. Barack Obama once knew that. He probably still does. ||||| President Barack Obama on Friday tried to grab back the mantle of change — and remind his base why they came out in force for him four years ago. The broad strokes are the same as when he declared his support for gay marriage last month: a key 2008 constituency that had spent three and a half years nursing its disappointment, now thrown a late-breaking move to ramp up its enthusiasm. Text Size - + reset In both, the president had very little to lose — many voters who dislike his support for gay marriage or refusal to deport young immigrants probably weren’t in play anyway. But he had a huge amount to gain in enthusiasm, in reconnecting with the spirit of his first campaign, and most of all, in driving up turnout. In an election that could well turn on the margin of Latinos supporting him in key swing states — and coming out to the polls — that’s no small matter. The policy shift is Obama’s latest and perhaps most controversial flexing of administration power to bend a reality that Congress wouldn’t change. Comprehensive immigration reform remains untouched, the DREAM Act — which would create a path to citizenship for some young illegal immigrants — is all but dead on Capitol Hill. But Friday, the president went as far under federal policy as he could without Congress. There’s no path to citizenship, but hundreds of thousands of young people born abroad and brought into the country illegally no longer have to worry that they’ll be deported as soon as they finish high school. The Department of Homeland Security directive would end deportation for people under 30 who came to the U.S. under the age of 16, have lived here continuously for the past five years, have graduated from high school or have been honorably discharged from the military — so long as they don’t have serious criminal records. “These are young people who study in our schools, they play in our neighborhoods, they’re friends with our kids, they pledge allegiance to our flag,” Obama said in the Rose Garden. “They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: On paper.” Obama holds a wide margin over Republican Mitt Romney among Latinos, who are concentrated in several key election states, including Nevada, Colorado and Florida. But the president’s failure to deliver on comprehensive immigration reform has not gone unnoticed among Latinos, nor has the record number of deportations during his administration. His announcement Friday seems likely to change that. “It might move the undecideds, but its real effect is going to be on energizing Latino voters who were relatively dispirited after the deportations and the failure to act on immigration reform,” said Gary Segura, a co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions. “Both candidates are trying to get both choice and turnout. It helps Obama some on choice, and it helps him a lot on turnout.” Segura called the new policy a win for the president politically that has the potential to move the needle in Virginia and North Carolina — despite having relatively small Latino populations, those states are homes to many immigrants. But Segura said the greatest impact will be on three other states that are must-wins for the Obama campaign and heavily Latino. “In the case of Nevada and Colorado, states that the president is likely to win, this will move the goal posts for Mitt Romney even further. In a state like Florida, which I think is going to be a very competitive state, I think this helps Obama moderately among Latino voters there,” Segura said. In Florida — the eternal swing state, this year with two more electoral votes — Obama’s gotten people’s attention. Latinos in South and Central Florida “are not going to look on this lightly,” said Ana Cruz, a Tampa-based Democratic strategist who worked as Hillary Clinton’s Florida spokeswoman during the 2008 presidential campaign. Asked if this will energize Obama’s base, Cruz replied, “It absolutely should. If Latinos cannot get fired about this and about some of the Hispanic initiatives and the appointment of [Justice] Sonia Sotomayor, then shame on them, shame on us.” Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the Cook Political Report, said she isn’t sure if the new action puts a specific state in play, “but that might not be as important as getting Hispanic turnout to the level it was in 2008.” Hispanic voters backed Obama 67 percent to 31 percent over Sen. John McCain, according to Pew exit polls. ||||| President Obama’s Hispanic gamble By Jordy Yager - President Obama laid his chips down in a major election-year gamble this week that could help make or break his re-election bid for the White House. In a dead heat with Republican Mitt Romney, Obama has struggled in recent weeks, suffering a number of setbacks, and losing much of the news cycle momentum that carried him to Pennsylvania Ave. more than three years ago. The president’s been plagued by poor job report numbers, a public speaking gaffe in which he said the private sector was doing “fine,” a failed voter recall election of Wisconsin’s Republican governor, and a relentless amount of political fire aimed at his attorney general on two fronts from GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill. But with Friday’s announcement that his administration would not deport certain young people who are in the country illegally, Obama threw down his chips, partially fulfilling a campaign promise he made to Latinos in his bid to be president, and putting Romney and Republican congressional hopefuls in a bind. Obama is actively grinding to hold onto the 67 percent of Latinos who voted for him in 2008, while he has battled an increasingly vocal tide of Latino advocacy groups who have not been timid in voicing their disapproval of his inability to pass comprehensive immigration reform or the DREAM Act. The grand move on Friday was one in a series of steps Obama has taken recently in an effort to galvanize his liberal base, including his public endorsement of marriage equality aimed at gay-rights advocates and his decision to require religious organizations to grant their employees’ access to birth control in a nod to pro-choice supporters. The political payoff of the new immigration policy could be huge, according to some experts, who cite the large Latino populations in key electoral states, such as Florida, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Virginia. But it could also backfire for Obama among demographics that worry greatly about illegal immigrants taking job opportunities away from people in the country legally. The White House said it expects about 800,000 young illegal immigrants to take part in its new policy to gain temporary worker status. “It's a medium risk, high reward strategy,” said Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons. “I think you risk angering people who are upset about immigration, yes. But for a president who’s got to win Florida, Nevada, Colorado, it is definitely something that can give the Latino community something to rally around.” The news of the policy shift threatened to take the wind out of Romney’s sails as he began a greatly hyped five-day, six-state bus tour on Friday and took to blasting Obama for being “detached” and “distant” while making no mention of the president's announcement. But Republicans on Capitol Hill easily made up for any silence from Romney’s camp, with top-ranking GOP lawmakers relentlessly blasting the decision. Some called it unconstitutional, while Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a member of the Tea Party, promised to sue the administration for circumventing Congress’s authority. Anticipating the blowback, the White House lost no time in conducting a full-court press on the issue as it launched Democratic lawmakers, staffers, and operatives across the country to spread the president’s message of what the new policy entails. More than two-dozen senior administration officials are scheduled to hold an all-day White House Hispanic Community Action Summit in Maryland on Saturday where they will join Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in laying out the details of the new policy. And Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), one of Obama’s most influential supporters in the Latino community and chairman of the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, immediately went to the mats for the president as he announced plans to hold an information session on Monday to help immigrants in Chicago understand the details of the new policy. Meanwhile, Obama campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt shot out an email aimed at painting a large divide between Romney and Obama just hours after the president addressed reporters in the Rose Garden. “During the primaries, Gov. Romney called the DREAM Act a handout and said he would veto it,” LaBolt said in a statement. “Today he continues to refuse to express support for legislation that lets children who were brought to the U.S. and want to contribute by pursuing higher education or serving in the military stay in America.” |||||Summary:","completion":"President Barack Obama's decision to enact sweeping changes to U.S. immigration policy in 2012 was met with controversy. His executive order prevented the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children and granted them work authorizations to which they would not otherwise be entitled under law. Critics argued that the president did not possess the constitutional authority to make this unilateral decision, as it violates the constitutional separation of powers and requires an act of Congress. Despite these concerns, the executive order was seen by some as a strategic move to energize and secure the Latino vote in key swing states during the 2012 election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Premise: \\"and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He made the glider by himself.\\"?","completion":"If the given premise is true, we can draw and analyze several conclusions and insights about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He made the glider by himself.\\" The premise states: \\"and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and\\" – This sentence fragment suggests that the individual in question managed to create a hang glider using a few tires and possibly other materials or components. The use of \\"all of a sudden\\" indicates that the process was relatively quick, or at least quicker than one might expect when constructing a hang glider. Considering this premise, it becomes necessary to determine the plausibility of the hypothesis \\"He made the glider by himself.\\" There are three main factors to take into account: 1. Materials and resources: The premise indicates that the individual created the hang glider using \\"a few tires.\\" This suggests that they possess some level of resourcefulness and creativity, considering unconventional materials in constructing the hang glider. However, we do not know if the tires were the only components used or if there were other materials involved in creating the glider. It's also possible that the individual found or sourced the needed materials, or had help obtaining them. 2. Skills and expertise: Constructing a hang glider is a complex task that typically requires a degree of engineering knowledge, design skills, and experience with aerodynamics. If the person in the premise possesses such skills or expertise, it would strengthen the likelihood that they can create a hang glider by themselves. However, if they possess limited knowledge, this may suggest that external assistance or guidance was provided to successfully assemble the glider. Additionally, having a few tires may imply that they are a resourceful person who can make use of available materials, but not necessarily that they made the glider completely by themselves. 3. Time and assistance: The use of \\"all of a sudden\\" indicates that the hang glider was created relatively quickly. This may suggest that the individual is highly competent and efficient in constructing a hang glider, and it's plausible that they completed the project by themselves. However, the phrase doesn't provide a clear indication of the time invested in the project, nor does it make it clear whether any assistance was received in constructing the glider. Taking these factors into consideration, it's important to note that the premise does not clearly support or refute the hypothesis \\"He made the glider by himself.\\" While the individual in question exhibits resourcefulness, ingenuity, and perhaps even some level of expertise, it remains uncertain whether they were solely responsible for constructing the hang glider. Therefore, without additional information or context, it is difficult to conclusively determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the given premise. More details about the project, the individual's background, and information concerning any potential external assistance would be necessary to validate or refute the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who planned to work with his longtime librettist? ? The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Heather Locklear’s loved ones are considering putting her under a conservatorship after she was reportedly placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold. “Heather’s lawyer is consulting with Britney Spears’ conservatorship lawyers,” a source close to the 57-year-old actress’ legal team tells Us Weekly exclusively. “Heather’s family feels absolutely helpless and feels this could be the only way to save her life. She won’t stay in treatment and consistently checks out early.” The source notes that the possible conservatorship “would be of Heather as a person only, nothing involving her finances or estate.” TMZ reported that the Melrose Place alum was hospitalized as a precaution on Sunday, November 18, after a therapist determined that she was having another mental breakdown. Spears, 36, has been under the guidance of a conservatorship since 2008, after she was hospitalized in the wake of a much-publicized breakdown and divorce from Kevin Federline, with whom she shares sons Preston, 13, and Jayden, 12. The Grammy winner cannot make personal or financial decisions without the approval of her father, Jamie Spears, and lawyer Andrew Wallet due to an undisclosed mental illness. The news of Locklear’s latest hospitalization came after a difficult few months. She was arrested in February for allegedly attacking a police officer after a dispute with her boyfriend, Chris Heisser. She briefly sought treatment the following month. Days after undergoing a psychiatric evaluation in June, Locklear was arrested again and later charged with battery on a police officer and an EMT.

A:","completion":"A: The United States declared war on Germany during World War II on December 11, 1941. This decision was prompted by several key events that led to escalating tensions between the two countries. Prior to the U.S. involvement in the war, Germany, under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, had been aggressively expanding its territory and influence in Europe, in direct conflict with the interests of the United States and other allied powers. The U.S. had been providing support to Great Britain and its allies through various means, such as the Lend-Lease program, but had not yet officially entered the conflict. The critical turning point for the U.S. occurred on December 7, 1941, when the Japanese launched a surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This event galvanized the American public and the U.S. government into action, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declaring December 7th as \\"a date which will live in infamy\\" during his address to Congress the following day. The United States formally declared war on Japan on December 8th. While the focus of the U.S. war declaration was initially on Japan, due to the Tripartite Pact – a military alliance signed in 1940 by Germany, Italy, and Japan – Germany declared war on the United States on December 11, 1941. In response, the United States reciprocated the same day, formally declaring war on Germany. The declaration of war on Germany marked the official entry of the United States into World War II on the side of the Allied Powers, which included countries such as the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, China, and other nations fighting against the Axis Powers led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. This decision significantly shifted the dynamics of the war, as the U.S. mobilized its vast industrial and military resources towards the war effort, ultimately playing a crucial role in the defeat of the Axis Powers and the end of World War II in 1945."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

They soon run into trouble, first narrowly avoiding another motorist, then having a sudden scare as the bridge near the cabin begins to collapse as they cross. That night, while Cheryl is making a drawing of a clock, her hand becomes violently possessed by a mysterious entity, causing her to draw a picture that looks like a book with a deformed, evil face. She fails to mention the incident to the others, dismissing it as her imagination. When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty go down to investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recording of incantations in which, when played by Ash then Scotty, unleashes demons and evil spirits. Cheryl becomes hysterical when a tree crashes through the window, and she runs to her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. She is attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. The others do not believe her story, but Ash agrees to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to the rest of the world has been destroyed.

Article: London: It's well known that Charles Darwin's famous theory of evolution annoyed many people because it was against the Biblical view of creation. But few know that it also created problems for Darwin at home with his deeply religious wife, Emma. \\"Darwin _ the publication of On the Origin of Species to avoid offending his wife,\\" says Ruth Padel, the naturalist's great - great - granddaughter. \\"Emma told him that he seemed to be putting God further and further off\\", Padel says in her north London home. \\"But they talked it through, and Emma once said, 'Don't change any of your ideas for fear of hurting me.'\\" As the world celebrates the 200th birthday of the man who changed scientific thought forever and the 150th anniversary of his book today, even his opponents admitted he was a giant figure. Though opposition to his theory continues, it is the elegant explanation of how species evolutes through natural selection that makes his 200th birthday such a major event. More than 300 celebrations have been planned in Britain alone, where Darwin's face graces the 10-pound bill along with that of Queen Elizabeth II. Shrewsbury, the central England town where Darwin was born and raised, is holding a month-long festival for its most famous son. Down House, his former home near London, will hold a permanent exhibition recreating some of his most famous experiments. Many more events have been planned all over the world. What would he be doing if he were alive today? Padel thinks he would properly be studying DNA and the immune system. Question: The main purpose of the author is _ . - to say something about Darwin and his wife - to introduce Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution - to sing high praise for the book On the Origin of Species - to report some celebrations of Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of his books A:","completion":"The main purpose of the author is to report some celebrations of Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of his books. While the article does provide some background information about Charles Darwin, his theory of evolution, his personal life including the conflict it created with his religious wife, and the enduring impact of his book \\"On the Origin of Species\\", the primary focus is to discuss the various global celebrations taking place in honor of Darwin's monumental scientific influence and contributions. The article extensively details numerous special events, exhibitions, and festivals that have been organized in Britain, including the placement of Darwin's face on the 10-pound bill, the month-long festivities in his hometown of Shrewsbury, and a permanent showcase at his former home, Down House. Furthermore, it outlines the recognition and acknowledgement of his legacy worldwide, underlining the relevance of his work in today's scientific landscape, with the speaker suggesting that Darwin would be exploring DNA and immunology if he were alive. Thus, while elements of all answers are reflected in the text, the most comprehensive statement of the article's main purpose is reporting on the extensive celebrations of Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of his revolutionary books."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Unfolding the legend of Deer Woman As Jake arrives at the small town nearby the forest for his preparations, he learns about an ancient legend of the so-called \\"Deer Woman\\" from the locals. According to them, this malevolent forest spirit disguises as a half-woman, half-deer creature that lures humans into the forest, never to be seen again. However, Jake, intrigued by the tale, grows even more eager to uncover the truth.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Metabolism and Obesity Obesity in the United States is epidemic. The rate of obesity has been steadily rising since the 1980s. In the 1990s, most states reported that less than 10 percent of their populations was obese, and the state with the highest rate reported that only 15 percent of their population was considered obese. By 2010, the U. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nearly 36 percent of adults over 20 years old were obese and an additional 33 percent were overweight, leaving only about 30 percent of the population at a healthy weight. These studies find the highest levels of obesity are concentrated in the southern states. They also find the level of childhood obesity is rising. Obesity is defined by the body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of an individual’s weight-to-height ratio. The normal, or healthy, BMI range is between 18 and 24.9 kg/m2. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, and obesity is considered to be a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. Obesity can arise from a number of factors, including overeating, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, limited sleep, genetic factors, and even diseases or drugs. Severe obesity (morbid obesity) or long-term obesity can result in serious medical conditions, including coronary heart disease; type 2 diabetes; endometrial, breast, or colon cancer; hypertension (high blood pressure); dyslipidemia (high cholesterol or elevated triglycerides); stroke; liver disease; gall bladder disease; sleep apnea or respiratory diseases; osteoarthritis; and infertility.

Why do some animals live longer than others? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available options: i. no. ii. yes.","completion":"I will answer the first question: Why do bigger animals live longer? Step 1: Analyze the question and identify key elements The question is asking about the relationship between the size of animals and their lifespan. Step 2: Research information on the topic By consulting various sources, I found out that, in general, larger animals tend to live longer than smaller ones. This is mainly due to their slower metabolic rates, which reduces the aging process and cellular damage over time. Step 3: Compile the obtained information into a response Larger animals usually live longer because they have slower metabolic rates. This slowed-down metabolism results in less stress on their cells, causing less damage over time and extending their lifespans. Now I will answer the second question: Why do some animals live longer than others? Step 1: Analyze the question and identify key elements The question is asking about the factors that determine the differences in lifespan among animals. Step 2: Research information on the topic After researching, I found out multiple factors contribute to the differences in lifespan among animals. These factors include genetics, size, metabolic rates, environmental factors, and adaptations to specific habitats. Step 3: Compile the obtained information into a response Several factors contribute to the differences in the lifespans of animals, including genetics, size, metabolic rates, environmental factors, and adaptations to specific habitats. These factors affect the overall health, growth, and aging process of different species, leading to varying lifespans. Finally, I will determine if the two questions are the same. To do this, we can compare the focus of both questions. Step 1: Analyze the focus of each question The first question focuses on the relationship between the size of animals and their lifespans. The second question focuses on various factors that contribute to the differences in lifespans among animals. Step 2: Compare the focus and main topic of both questions Although both questions overlap regarding the size of animals affecting lifespans, the first question specifically addresses this relationship, while the second question encompasses multiple factors that contribute to animals' differing lifespans. Step 3: Answer if the questions are the same or not Based on the comparison, I would choose option i. no, as the questions are not the same, but they share a common aspect related to the size of animals and their lifespans."},{"prompt":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: What is the author's profession? Options: - not enough information - Doctor. - Journalist. - Pharmacist.

Background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Paragraph: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village experiences more stress build up in the rocks? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it is likely that Arrow village experiences more stress build-up in the rocks compared to Bow village. Although both villages are situated near plate boundaries and experience earthquakes, Bow village gets a significantly higher number of earthquakes annually. This implies that the stress in the rocks at Bow village is released more frequently, preventing excessive build-up. On the other hand, Arrow village gets only a few earthquakes, which suggests that the stress in the rocks is not released as frequently, leading to a greater build-up of stress over time. The elastic rebound theory further supports this conclusion, as it states that stresses continue to accumulate within the rocks until they ultimately break, causing an earthquake. The higher frequency of earthquakes in Bow village means that the accumulated stress is released more regularly, while the comparatively fewer numbers of earthquakes in Arrow village indicate that there may be a higher overall stress build-up in the rocks before it is finally released as an earthquake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She had been working on a doctorate in English, but set aside her work to marry Richard (Gregg Edelman) and raise their 3-year-old daughter, Lucy (Sadie Goldstein). Her marriage falls apart when she discovers that Richard is addicted to online pornography. She meets Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), a law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. Although Brad's marriage to Katherine (Jennifer Connelly) is loving and amicable, it has been lacking intimacy.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"A businessman should study several aspects of number literacy to excel in their field. Number literacy, also known as numerical literacy or numeracy, is the ability to understand and work with numbers and mathematical concepts. Here are some key areas a businessman should focus on: 1. Basic arithmetic operations: Proficiency in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division is essential, as these operations serve as the foundation for all financial calculations. 2. Fractions, decimals, and percentages: Businessmen should be comfortable working with these numerical representations, as they frequently appear in financial statements, reports, and forecasts. 3. Financial mathematics: This includes understanding concepts like compound interest, annuities, net present value (NPV), future value (FV), and internal rate of return (IRR). These concepts are crucial in evaluating investment opportunities and making financial decisions. 4. Probability and statistics: Comprehending probability and statistical concepts helps businessmen analyze data, identify trends, and make informed decisions. They should be adept at working with averages, medians, standard deviations, correlations, and regression analyses. 5. Accounting: Familiarity with accounting concepts, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, is vital for tracking a company's financial health. An understanding of key financial ratios, such as profitability, liquidity, and solvency, also plays a significant role in the assessment of business performance and decision-making. 6. Data analysis and interpretation: Businessmen should be skilled at interpreting financial data, charts, and tables to gain insight into their organization's performance and make informed decisions accordingly. 7. Budgeting: A strong understanding of budgeting techniques is crucial for forecasting future expenses and managing a company's financial resources effectively. 8. Financial planning: Familiarity with long-term financial planning concepts helps businessmen determine a company's financial goals and strategize how to achieve those goals while considering various factors like taxation, inflation, and risk. In the Star Wars universe, the best businessman could be argued to be Sheev Palpatine, also known as Emperor Palpatine or Darth Sidious. By manipulating political and economic systems, he managed to gain control of the Galactic Republic, turning it into the Galactic Empire. Although Palpatine is not a traditional businessman in the conventional sense, his ability to create and manipulate vast resources, political influence, and a grand plan to achieve ultimate power exemplifies strategic thinking, cunning, and a ruthless pursuit of ambition often seen in highly successful businesspeople. The two questions you provided are not paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase is a restatement of a statement or passage in other words to clarify its meaning. The first question pertains to the essential numeracy skills a businessman should possess, while the second question discusses a specific character from the Star Wars franchise who exemplifies successful business acumen.

Article: Keep the rat cage in an area where you are often present and the rats can watch what's going on around them. This will prevent feelings of isolation. The more attention you give, the more bonded, active, healthy, and friendly your rat will be. A single rat is a lonely rat, and this can cause behavioral issues. Unless your rat is aggressive, they are best not left alone. Even if they are aggressive, patient love and attention can bring them around. Handle the rats daily, preferably two to three times a day for ten minutes or more. Rats love to learn and solve problems, so consider setting up little obstacle courses containing hidden treats in order to mentally stimulate your rats. Teach tricks by starting slow, rewarding, and reinforcing with treats and praise if done correctly. Rats are very intelligent, and can learn many tricks, such as jumping through a hoop, spinning in a circle, standing up, and even giving a handshake, all on spoken command. Do not punish your rat for failure. Rats don't understand negative punishments, and will only confuse the rat. Instead, give them a treat when they do it right. If your rat bites, don't give him a firm tap and a \\"no.\\" Instead, squeak like a rat would and pull away. Eventually your rat will understand. Do not forget that each rat has his or her own personality, meaning that one rat may learn differently from others. Any specific method of teaching may work for one rat, but may not for another. The key to successful training is to be persistent and have lots of short training sessions filled with treats. Rats enjoy a change of scenery and a chance to stretch their legs and explore. Rats should be taken out at least one hour per day. You can let them roam around on your shoulder or somewhere in your house where it won't be a problem. If you take your rats outside, a harness is a good idea so that you have some control if the rat becomes frightened.

Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help.

Users can get email Alerts if they’ve kept their titles too long. You can link to your FeedFlix page on your blog or email it to friends. We’ll always keep your page up to date. Zero effort required. Keyboard optional. FeedFlix is a neat little application that utilizes the new Netflix API to help you get the most out of your account - or at least make you aware of the fact that you might be wasting some money. After syncing your FeedFlix account with Netflix, you’ll be able to see a bunch of stats about your account, as well as a comparison as to how to stack up versus other Netflix users (who have registered for FeedFlix). For example, in the account pictured below, you can see that your average cost of a movie is 2.99, which means that 76% of users pay less than you. You can also see what your average time is to return DVDs, and sign up for email alerts to let you know if you’re keeping your movies for too long. Other cool stats include your average movies viewed each month, how long you typically keep a movie before sending it back, and a graphical view of your returns over time. There’s also aggregate data on most popular plans, most rented DVDs, and queue sizes for all FeedFlix users. FeedFlix also pulls in data like your current DVD queue and all of the reviews you’ve published on Netflix. The site has pulled in actual reviews from Netflix users, so if you click on a movie title, you’ll be able to see it without leaving. That actually turns FeedFlix into a bit of a social discovery site, since you can see who is renting different movies and then click on their name to see their full queue. Overall, Feedflix has the feel of a personal finance site like Mint, but for managing your movie rentals. Obviously, managing your Netflix account isn’t nearly as complex as managing your checkbook, but at the very least, it’s some cool stats that will most likely tell you the obvious: you keep movies for too long. Perhaps some specific recommendations - like which plan you should switch to - would be a nice addition. Feedflix claims to have attracted 10,000 users so far.

Question: I read this background article the other day: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. I am facing a new situation today: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Are the volcanoes on Sarahn more or less active than on Timon? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information from the article, the volcanoes on Sarahn should be more active than those on Timon. This is because Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift, with continents breaking apart and moving. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. This occurs as young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, causing the ocean floor to rise, which in turn results in an increase in volcanic activity. On the other hand, Timon has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite a while now. This suggests that the formation of new oceanic crust through volcanic activity is less frequent on Timon compared to Sarahn. In conclusion, the volcanoes on Sarahn should be more active than those on Timon, due to the ongoing geographic shifts and continental movements on Sarahn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With no Dez Bryant or Tony Romo, how would the rest of the team respond? Coach Jason Garrett's mantra of \\"next man up\\" played a big part in preparing for the game against the Atlanta Falcons. Backup quarterback Brandon Weeden started for the first time since last season against the Arizona Cardinals, but this outing was much different. He completed 22 of 26 passes for 232 yards. Although he threw one interception and had zero touchdowns, the loss could not be blamed on him alone. The Cowboys played very well in the first half, outscoring the Falcons 28-17; however, the Falcons made a few halftime adjustments that squashed any running game the Cowboys pursued. On the other hand, the Cowboys had no answer for Julio Jones, who ran 164 yards and had 2 touchdowns. Owner Jerry Jones said after the game that the Cowboys just looked tired in the second half. In typical fashion for this season, the Falcons came back late in the third quarter and won the game 39-28. How many points in total were scored?","completion":"To find the total number of points scored, we can add the points from both teams.

On 13 June 1990, the East German military officially began dismantling the Wall, beginning in Bernauer Straße and around the Mitte district. From there, demolition continued through Prenzlauer Berg/Gesundbrunnen, Helligensee and throughout the city of Berlin until that December 1990. According to estimates by the border troops, a total of around 1.7 million tonnes of building rubble was produced by the demolition. Unofficially, the demolition of the Bornholmer Straße began because of construction work on the railway. This involved a total of 300 GDR border guards and - after 3 October 1990 - 600 Pioneers of the Bundeswehr. These were equipped with 175 trucks, 65 cranes, 55 excavators and 13 bulldozers. Virtually every road that was severed by the Berlin Wall, every road that once linked from West Berlin to East Berlin, was reconstructed and reopened by 1 August 1990. In Berlin alone, 184 km of wall, 154 km border fence, 144 km signal systems and 87 km barrier ditches were removed. What remained were six sections that were to be preserved as a memorial. Various military units dismantled the Berlin/Brandenberg border wall, completing the job in November 1991. Painted wall segments with artistically valuable motifs were put up for auction in 1990 in Berlin and Monte Carlo. How many total km of border fence and barrier ditches combined were removed in Berlin?","completion":"To find the total km of border fence and barrier ditches combined that were removed in Berlin, we need to add the km of border fence and km of barrier ditches together.

Article:Mr Maduro said the UN had the expertise to normalise the supply and distribution of drugs in the country. Venezuela's Medical Federation said recently that hospitals had less than 5% of the medicines they needed. The president blames the problems on an economic war against his government and the sharp fall in oil prices. \`\`I've asked for support from the United Nations to help treat the economic and social injuries that have hit our people,'' he said Friday on television.

We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I’m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture.

Write a title for this article: It was the mid-80s and we were on the verge of making it big all over the world, having just released Sparkle in the Rain. However, as with many UK bands, the US was proving tough to crack. Then our record company came to us with an idea. The director John Hughes was making a movie called The Breakfast Club, and they thought it would be a great vehicle for their bands. All this sounded great until they said: “And we’ve got a song for you.” Being chippy Glaswegians, we said: “What? Nah, we write our own songs.” But Bruce Findlay, our manager, said: “Look, go and see the movie, just so you’re not being rude.” A cinema in the West End was hired to show us a rough cut, but we couldn’t give a toss about teenage American schoolkids. But my wife at the time, Chrissie [Hynde], who was older and wiser, kept badgering me. “I like the song,” she said. “What’s the problem?” Finally, the song’s writer, Keith Forsey, phoned me and rather cleverly said: “I’m a huge fan of the band. How about I just spend a couple of days with you? Maybe we’ll do something in the future.” We clicked right away, though we did spend rather a lot of time in the pub. Eventually, I started to feel sorry for him. “Maybe we should go into a studio for an afternoon,” I said, “and bang out his tune.” At that stage, the song was just a demo on a battered cassette, with Keith singing over some keyboards. It didn’t sound like something we would do, but in the bonding session with our new best mate we had a go. I added the big “la, la-la-la-la” ending because I didn’t have any lyrics. I said I’d write some, but Keith said: “Over my dead body. We’re keeping that.” By the end, we were sneaking off to our rooms to listen to it. The Breakfast Club came out three months later, and Don’t You (Forget About Me) was released as a single. MTV were all over it, and soon it was at No 2 in the US charts. A week later, I was sitting in the south of France when I got a call telling me we had an American No 1. We made the video in a manor house, surrounded by stuff from a junk shop, wearing really bad clothes​​ Eight years earlier, in 1977, I’d asked my dad for £100 so we could start the band. He was a brickie’s labourer and just sat there in his vest, like Rab C Nesbitt, thinking we were nuts. “You mean like the Beatles,” he said, “playing in stadiums?” I said: “Probably.” When we performed Don’t You (Forget About Me) in Philadelphia for Live Aid in 1985, my dad was down the front. It was the first of many stadiums – although he never got the £100 back. We started bonding with Keith the minute we found out he’d been the drummer in the krautrock band Amon Düül II. He couldn’t believe we were into German experimental music. He thought it was some obscure thing nobody knew about, so we told him how all our early stuff was based around the same repetitive, metronomic grooves. Then, when we found out he had played all the electronic drums on the records Giorgio Moroder produced for Donna Summer, including I Feel Love, we just adored him. He had so much energy, he was dancing in the studio. We’d just finished Sparkle in the Rain, the biggest, most bombastic album we’d done. So when it came to Don’t You (Forget About Me), I ramped up the intro with these massive power chords. It was almost a caricature – I associated powerchords with American AOR. But it worked. We made a video in a manor house, surrounded by a load of stuff from a junk shop, wearing really bad clothes we’d been given. So you’ve got this movie about US high-school kids, with a song by a band from Glasgow in a manor house in England. It was the thinnest of concepts, but it became huge. At the time, we felt the song didn’t suit us, because we had delusions of being ultra-hip. When I listen to it now, it’s obviously a brilliant, well-crafted pop song. I’m embarrassed we dissed it so much. • Don’t You (Forget About Me) appears on Simple Minds Acoustic, out now on Caroline International.

Help as much as you can. Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully. I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why.

The \\"temporary dismissals\\" will only apply to yellow cards shown for dissent, and will see players leave the field for 10 minutes. \\"It's a chance to see a little change, it's an experiment,\\" Gallagher told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. \\"It might be in years to come we go, 'well it doesn't work, but at least we've tried it'. \\"One of the suspension problems we've got is, if the player gets two yellow cards in a game and gets sent off, he doesn't serve a ban against the team he committed the fouls or dissent against, he actually commits it against their rivals [in a subsequent game].\\" The trial will take place in the bottom tier of English football's National League System and also be tested in Sunday League and male and female youth football. Irishman Gallagher, 59, worked as an official in English football for more than 20 years and was asked if sin bins could be introduced in the professional game. \\"It's not something you discount,\\" he replied. \\"Football is moving, evolving, it's totally different to when I refereed 10 years ago. There are so many games now where you see a player have two yellow cards, and he hasn't really committed a bad foul, there are so many technical bookings. \\"It might just be a way of calming that player down for 10 minutes, sending the message out to his team-mates that, 'we can't afford to be short of a player for 10 minutes', and saving second yellow cards. \\"With experimenting at the lower levels I think it's quite a good idea. Most of the local parks referees are young lads coming into the game; they're new and limited in their experience of refereeing and their life skills because they are teenagers, early 20s. \\"I think players try to take them on a little bit. If suddenly one of these lads took umbrage to something that was said to him and whizzes a player off for 10 minutes, the message that will be sent out will be, 'blimey, we're not going to do that again'.

Red, a former ally, is falsely accused of treason and sentenced to life in a maximum-security prison called \\"The Fortress.\\" Jack's team includes: - Sarah Roberts, a talented hacker and surveillance expert - Liam Preston, an inspired, rebellious engineer who can create gadgets to infiltrate any security system - Maria Flores, an ex-undercover agent with a deep knowledge of prison staff and their routines - Max Chen, a gifted getaway driver Together, they devise an ingenious plan to breach the prison's seemingly impenetrable security. This narrative showcases their resourcefulness as they secure stolen vehicles, advanced technology, and state-of-the-art weapons. Each team member faces their own internal struggles as their emotions and pasts threaten to derail the mission. As they move closer to the execution of their plan, they realize that they need an inside man to help them gain access to the prison.

To achieve this, he needs to forge strategic alliances and outwit dangerous inmates who would do anything to sabotage his plans. Red manages to befriend a key prison guard, Nicholas Johnson, who sympathizes with Red and agrees to become Jack's team inside man. Together, they begin to lay the groundwork for the daring escape. The Climax: The two narratives converge when Jack's team launches a synchronized attack on the prison, breaching its defenses and moving rapidly to secure Red's release. At the same time, Red and Nicholas create a distraction to draw the guards away from their escape route. Chaos erupts as prison alarms blare, gunfire erupts, and Jack's team employs their skill sets in a high-stakes battle to ensure Red's freedom. As the characters fight their way through enemies, they experience harrowing close-calls and self-discovery, forging stronger bonds between them. The Resolution: Red is successfully rescued, and the group makes a narrow escape in Max's carefully chosen getaway vehicles.

Given the following context: The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was established in 1867 by William Austin. Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of 61 acres (0.25 km2; 0.10 sq mi) was purchased.However, the Queen's Park project... answer the following question: What was the founder of the Artizans Company paid a cent a day to do?

Summarize this article in one sentence. ” Look for denture adhesive creams, like Fixodent, Polident, or Poligrip, with those labels. They mean the adhesive is long-lasting. If you only plan on using the cream for your fangs, choose the smallest tube, like a 2.5 oz (84 g) one, as you won’t need very much. You can buy denture cream from a pharmacy, drug store, or online retailer. Most tubes cost less than 5. Blot the tissue all over your top teeth and gums to remove any excess moisture. This helps the denture adhesive cream stick to your teeth better. Do this right before you’re ready to apply the fang. You can also use a paper towel or cotton swab instead of a tissue. Hold the tip of the tube at the wide top of the fang and squeeze a tiny amount of cream onto the fang. Keep the cream on the top half of the fang since that’s the part that will be against your tooth. If you get too much on the fang or some on the pointy tip, wipe off the extra with a cotton swab. Use individual fangs instead of the ones that come in whole sets of teeth. You can buy fangs at a Halloween store or party goods store. Press the fang against your canine tooth so that the pointy tip is facing down and the concave side with the adhesive is covering your tooth. Hold it with your fingers until you can move your hand away and the fang stays in place. To find your canine tooth, start at the middle of your upper teeth and count over 3 teeth. It’s the 3rd tooth from the center and is usually slightly pointier than the others. Use a timer or the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time if necessary. Repeat the same process on your other canine tooth. Squeeze a dot of denture adhesive cream onto the back of the fang, then hold it in place for 10 to 15 seconds on your tooth. Try to align the 2nd fang so that the pointy tip is as far down as the 1st fang and they’re even. Don't eat with your fangs in. If you do, you could crack the fangs or they could fall off. Instead, peel them off by pulling them forward and set them aside before you eat. Take them off before you sleep, too. After eating, dab a little more denture cream on the back of each fang and stick them back onto your teeth. If you want the fangs to hold better, brush your teeth and dry them with a tissue before putting the fangs on again.

(Associated Press) Indian policemen gather next to the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya colony in Gujarat state, India, Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018. The 182-meters (597 feet) bronze statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, a key independence... (Associated Press) KEVADIYA, India (AP) — India's prime minister on Wednesday unveiled a towering bronze statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, a key independence leader and the country's first home minister after British colonialists left in 1947. At 182 meters (597 feet), it is one of the tallest statues in the world built at a cost of 403 million in Kevadiya, a village in Gujarat state. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Patel hail from Gujarat state. Modi inaugurated the \\"Statue of Unity\\" on the bank of the Narmada river. He had promised the project despite criticism that India couldn't afford to spend so much money on a statue. Indian air force planes showered flower petals on the statue. Patel was known as the \\"Iron Man of India\\" for integrating various states in the post-independence era as the creation of Pakistan led to a massive bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims moving between the two nations. On Wednesday, Modi said Patel was a beacon of hope for India in the time of crisis and he will be a source of inspiration for ages to come. Rashesh Patel, a 42-year-old businessman, said \\"though Patel was from Gujarat state, all Indians were proud of him because of his stature.\\" Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel were the three key leaders of India's independence struggle, he said. The monument will have a museum with 40,000 documents, 2,000 photographs and a research center dedicated to Patel's life and work. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The \\"statue of unity\\" has been billed as a tourist attraction. India has unveiled the world's tallest statue, which cost 29.9bn rupees (£330m; 430m) to build. The 182m (600ft) high structure in the western state of Gujarat is a bronze-clad tribute to independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the \\"statue of unity\\" would serve as a major tourist attraction. But locals say this is as a waste of public money and that the funds could have been put to better use. Mr Modi, who unveiled the statue at a grand inaugural event, said it is \\"a symbol of India's integrity and resolve.\\" Air Force planes showered flowers on the statue, which was designed by decorated Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar. According to local reports, thousands of policemen have been deployed across the district, where protests over the effigy have turned violent. Police detained farmers and tribal activists during a protest on Tuesday. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stunning visuals of the world's tallest statue The statue has become a rallying point for local farmers who are demanding compensation for land that they say has been acquired by the government for various projects, including the construction of the memorial. The Gujarat government is reported to have paid more than half of the funds for the statue, while the remainder came from the federal government or public donations. The memorial has been seen as a pet project of Mr Modi, who like Patel, was born in Gujarat. He commissioned the statue when he was the state's chief minister in 2010. It is nearly twice as tall as New York's Statue of Liberty. And it has surpassed the height of the Spring Temple Buddha in China which, at 128m, was previously the tallest in the world. But it won't remain the world's tallest statue for long. The government in the western state of Maharashtra is constructing a memorial to the Maratha warrior king Shivaji that is estimated to be 190m tall. Patel was India's first interior minister and deputy prime minister. He was known as the \\"Iron Man of India\\" after he persuaded feuding states to unite and become part of the Indian state after independence. While campaigning in 2013 to become prime minister, Mr Modi said, \\"every Indian regrets that Sardar Patel did not become the first prime minister\\". In recent years, Mr Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has embraced Patel in an attempt to claim his legacy. While Congress party politicians say Patel was a member of their party, the BJP says the freedom fighter's legacy belongs to everybody. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Officials expect that the 182m tall statue will attract millions of annual visitors Officials expect that the site, located some 200km (125 miles) from Gujarat's main city, Ahmedabad, will attract about 2.5 million annual visitors and will help boost local economy. Visitors can go up to the viewing gallery, which is located near the chest of the statue at a height of 153m. But locals, including farmers, are sceptical. \\"Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district,\\" Vijendra Tadvi, a farmer who also worked as a driver on the statue's construction site, told BBC Gujarati's Roxy Gagdekar. What went into making the world's tallest statue? ||||| Summary:","completion":"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated the world's tallest statue, the 182-metre-tall bronze likeness of independence activist Sardar Vallabbhai Patel.

By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. - A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work. - In computing , mechanisms and techniques for managing services often differ by operating system . Examples of operating system service management are : Service Control Manager - Used by Microsoft Windows launchd - Used by Apple OS X Systemd - Used by most Linux Upstart - Used by Google Chrome OS Service Management Facility - Used by Oracle Solaris Android init - Used by Google Android sysvinit - Used by older Unix - like operating systems cygserver - Used by Cygwin runit - Used by Void - An information system (IS) is any organized system for the collection, organization, storage and communication of information. More specifically, it is the study of complementary networks that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and distribute data. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. - Software engineering (SWE) is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. - In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products and systems. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are embedded systems (such as traffic lights, consumer appliances, remote controls and digital watches), computers, computer peripherals, mobile phones, and digital cameras. The firmware contained in these devices provides the low-level control program for the device. As of 2013, most firmware can be updated. - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function. - System software, or systems software, is computer software designed to provide services to other software. Examples of system software include \\"operating systems\\", computational science software, game engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications. - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed.

Newcastle Herald ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Fireworks 'chaos' as barge explodes Two people were injured when a barge carrying a New Year fireworks display caught fire at an Australian beach. A few minutes into the show at Terrigal Beach in New South Wales, an apparent malfunction caused fireworks to go off at random, some towards the beach. Thousands of people on the beach had to be moved to safety and police sealed off the area. Two pyrotechnicians jumped off the boat to get ashore and were later treated by paramedics for minor injuries. Local media quoted witnesses describing how the family-friendly fireworks show at 21:00 quickly turned to chaos. Loud explosions came from the barge as fireworks started going off simultaneously. \\"It was an absolute chaos,\\" Anooshe Mushtaq described the scene on Twitter. \\"The boat shooting the fireworks goes on fire and started shootings randomly. Lucky I escaped as soon as I saw the boat on fire.\\" Emergency services were called to the scene and police said the crowds - about 5-6,000 people - were removed from the beach as a precaution. The event organisers, It's Time for Terrigal, said on Facebook that they believed a canister had exploded, setting off \\"multiple detonations\\". What should have been a 12-minute display was \\"pushed into 4 and a half,\\" they said. \\"It became apparent this wasn't a directed event, as there [were] random fireworks going off, at this time it was deemed unsafe and we evacuated the area.\\" But overall, the event \\"went pretty well\\", they said.

Here is an article: In a confounding election season where voters hold deep reservations about the likely Republican and Democratic nominees, the third-party Libertarian ticket has a rare chance this year to be more than a footnote in the presidential race. And that chance – to absorb disaffected voters who have little interest in picking ‘Trump’ or ‘Clinton’ this November – is raising the stakes for the national convention starting Friday where activists with the oft-sidelined movement will choose their nominee. “There is a huge opportunity in this election cycle,” Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark told FoxNews.com. Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, heavily favored to win the Libertarian nomination, has been enjoying the spotlight lately as at least two recent polls have put him in double digits in a three-way race against Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. One Fox News poll showed Johnson pulling 10 percent against the two titans – not exactly in contention, but nevertheless impressive for a party that’s never garnered more than 1 percent of the vote in a presidential election. Whether Johnson’s numbers reflect growth among libertarians or simply a none-of-the-above choice, the candidate acknowledged in an interview with FoxNews.com, “It’s a combination of both.” But, presuming he can snag the nod at the Memorial Day weekend convention, which starts Friday and wraps up Monday in Orlando, Johnson indicated he’ll happily fill the role of Trump/Clinton alternative at a time when some voters are seeking out a third-party option. Delegates will nominate a candidate Sunday. “The nominee for the Libertarian Party is going to be the only third party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states,” he said. “I jokingly say that if Mickey Mouse were [the] third name in any polls, the recognizable figure that he is, [he] would be at 30 percent. But Mickey is not on the ballot in all 50 states.” While prominent conservatives have floated the idea of a new third party, state ballot access will indeed be a challenge. As Johnson says, the Libertarian Party – already on 32 state ballots – will likely be on all 50 state ballots by November. Upping his potential appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans, Johnson tapped another former GOP governor, William Weld of Massachusetts, to be his running mate, both fiscal conservatives and social liberals. “If conservative means smaller government, I think we are the proven commodity,” Johnson said. He is still short of the needed 15 percent to qualify for the presidential debates. But he believes if he’s in the debates, the ticket could collect electoral votes. “I would not be doing this if there wasn’t the opportunity to actually win,” Johnson said. “New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, there are some real opportunities.” The 15 percent debate threshold may be reachable. His standing in the Fox News poll was consistent with a Monmouth University poll in March that showed him at 11 percent. If the numbers hold, Johnson would far exceed third-party candidate Ralph Nader’s 3 percent in 2000, but still lag behind Ross Perot’s 19 percent in 1992. Johnson’s optimism about actually winning is tempered by reality and history. Not only does the party have a poor track record in general elections, but Johnson’s poll numbers haven’t always held up either. In the 2012 general election – when Johnson initially ran as a Republican and later as a Libertarian -- he polled at about 4 percent during the campaign but ended up getting less than 1 percent of the popular vote. Still, the 1.2 million votes represented a record for a Libertarian, and if the party can build on that this year, it could be enough to at least influence the outcome in November – though whether the candidate draws votes away from the GOP or Democratic nominee remains to be seen. Sarwark suggested they’ll pull from both sides. “A group of Republicans feel their party’s nomination was stolen from them by a reality TV star. A group of Democrats that supported Bernie Sanders don’t want to support a war hawk, who supports the racist war on drugs and has been a corporate shill,” he said. Last week, Weld made waves by comparing Trump’s deportation policy to Nazi tactics. But Johnson said they were not holding back on Clinton either, and are reaching out to disaffected Sanders supporters. “I don’t think there is any question that if Hillary is elected, government is going to expand. With regard to military and foreign policy, she has been an architect,” Johnson said. “Is anything going to change with regards to foreign policy? No.” There could still be some drama this weekend. About 1,000 delegates are expected to gather in Orlando. The top contenders are Johnson, anti-virus software developer John McAfee and libertarian media publisher Austin Petersen, and 15 other candidates. “If Johnson does not win on the first round, it will be mine,” McAfee told FoxNews.com in an email. Johnson likely isn’t guaranteed a first ballot victory, said William Irwin, the chairman of the philosophy department at King’s College, who has written books on libertarianism, most recently “Free Dakota.” “Some predicted the libertarian moment has passed. I think the libertarian moment is now,” Irwin told FoxNews.com. “But just like there are Never-Trump and Never-Hillary voters, there are some libertarians who are Never-Johnson. He was sort of an accidental Libertarian who came to the party after he couldn’t get into the [2012] Republican primary debates.” Johnson, if nominated, could run into trouble with some conservatives – yet attract liberals – as a supporter of abortion rights and marijuana legalization. He also favors military cuts and a reserved foreign policy, while backing sweeping entitlement reforms, changes to the tax code and term limits for members of Congress. Johnson and Weld, both two-term governors in the 1990s, were given A’s in the libertarian Cato Institute’s Fiscal Policy Report Card for cutting spending and taxes. “Two governors running against a candidate that has never held office and another who has not held executive office -- the Libertarians would be the most experienced ticket,” Cato Institute Executive Vice President David Boaz told FoxNews.com. He added, “But this year, experience isn’t what people are looking for.” Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Shaping the Libertarian Movement in the 2016 Presidential Election: The Potential Impact and Opportunities for Third-Party Candidates\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a negative yelp review (Choose from: - negative. - positive.).","completion":"Yelp Review: 1 out of 5 stars for The Bayview Restaurant Title: Disappointing dining experience in a seemingly lovely restaurant I had high hopes for The Bayview Restaurant, given its beautiful location and charming exterior, but unfortunately, I cannot in good conscience, recommend this place to potential diners. My family and I were celebrating an important milestone, and we decided to choose The Bayview after seeing some beautiful pictures online. However, from the moment we entered the establishment, we started experiencing issues. First, the hostess was noticeably absent when we arrived, leaving us awkwardly standing for nearly 20 minutes before someone attended to us. Clad in a stained apron, this staff member failed to apologize for the wait and hastily escorted us to a table that hadn't even been wiped clean. Despite our initial reservations, we decided to give The Bayview a chance. However, that didn't last long. The menus were tattered and sticky, which was a red flag for the kind of sanitary standards they had in place. After placing our orders, it took an astounding 45 minutes for our appetizers to arrive, and when they finally did, they were lukewarm at best. Furthermore, the seafood chowder tasted as if it had come straight out of a can, lacking any semblance of freshness, and the calamari was excessively greasy, leaving more oil on the plate than actual food. Sadly, our main courses didn't fare much better. The overcooked shrimp in the linguine appeared rubbery, not reflecting the high-quality seafood I'd expect. Likewise, the rib-eye steak, which was supposed to be medium-rare, arrived at our table charred and dry. The side dishes were also bland, making this meal a far cry from the gastronomic experience we were expecting. Throughout our evening, the service remained sluggish and apathetic. It felt as though the staff were genuinely disinterested in ensuring their customers' satisfaction. Not once did someone come to check on how our meal was or if we needed anything else. Additionally, as the evening wore on, the noise level in the dining room rose to near unbearable levels. It became nearly impossible to have a conversation without shouting across the table. This issue could have been easily resolved if the management had paid attention to their patrons and monitored the dining space more effectively. In summary, The Bayview Restaurant fell far short of our expectations. From the inattentiveness of the staff to the subpar quality of the food, the entire experience was a letdown. Despite the establishment's charm and lovely views of the bay, I would, unfortunately, advise potential diners to look elsewhere for a special night out or any dining experience for that matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Employment drops for first time since general election as Brexit fears mount Alan Clarke, a Scotiabank economist, said that the timing of the decline was “particularly striking”, as the reason for the last drop in employment was “ahead of the general election amid the uncertainty”. Mr Clarke said that weaker employment gains could be related to the uncertainty over the coming vote on Britain’s EU membership. “We have already seen tentative signs of a slowdown in hiring,” he said, referring to volatile single month estimates of employment that had shown a slowing in monthly job gains from close to 90,000 a month down “to a virtual standstill” in January and February. However, he noted those declines came before the June 23 referendum date was announced, “So it may well be that the drop in hiring reflects other things. Nonetheless, we are approaching the time when pre-Brexit jitters should begin to hold back job growth”. Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank, also expected the employment level to drop. He said that pre-referendum weakness was “evident in some of the survey numbers”. Yet he argued that it was too early to say that Brexit anxiety was responsible for falling employment, and that the weaker pace of hiring might not persist. “Brexit considerations aside, there is scope to pull workers into the job market,” said Mr Dixon. “The pace of employment growth will inevitably slow, given that a lot of low hanging fruit has already been gathered, but assuming are there no major shocks, there is every chance we will see continued growth.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are as follows: 1.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"pushing and pulling an object will increase its what\\" is \\"kinetic\\", given that pulling and pushing an object will increase its speed? Answer:","completion":"Based on the context of the question \\"pushing and pulling an object will increase its what,\\" the answer \\"kinetic\\" is a reasonable and accurate response, as it refers to an increase in the object's kinetic energy. When an object is subjected to pushing or pulling forces, its overall speed or velocity is likely to change. This change in speed directly affects its kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. Kinetic energy, represented by the symbol \\"K\\" or \\"KE,\\" is defined as the energy an object possesses due to its motion. The formula for kinetic energy is given as: KE = 0.5 × m × v² Here, \\"KE\\" stands for kinetic energy, \\"m\\" represents the object's mass, and \\"v\\" denotes its velocity. As the velocity of the object increases or decreases as a result of the pushing or pulling forces, the kinetic energy will correspondingly increase or decrease as well. It's important to consider the type of forces acting on an object, as they play a significant role in determining the resulting changes in kinetic energy. In the context of pushing and pulling, we can further elaborate on the significance of two types of forces: applied and net forces. 1. Applied Forces: These are external forces enacted on an object, such as the force exerted when pushing or pulling. They can cause the object to accelerate, decelerate, or change direction. Applied forces can act along with other forces, like friction or tension, to impact the overall motion of an object. 2. Net Forces: This refers to the sum of all forces acting on an object. If the net force is non-zero, it will cause the object to accelerate or decelerate, subsequently changing its kinetic energy. In the case of pushing or pulling an object, if the applied force is greater than the opposing forces, the result will be a net force that causes the object to accelerate or decelerate. To conclude, given that pushing and pulling an object results in changes to its speed or velocity, it follows that these actions can directly influence the object's kinetic energy. Consequently, the answer \\"kinetic\\" is an appropriate and accurate response to the question at hand. It both encompasses the concept of motion and takes into account the dynamic changes in the object's energy state as a result of the applied forces."},{"prompt":"I heard that Alex kept Addison's balance because she was not good with money.

Movie title: Tideland Movie plot: Tideland centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape. After her mother chokes to death, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid. During Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via taxidermy (which Dell and Dickens did to their own... Answer:","completion":"Dell, one of the characters in the movie Tideland, is blind in one eye due to a bee sting. This is a significant aspect of her character, as it contributes to the overall atmosphere of the film and the relationships between the characters. The movie Tideland, directed by Terry Gilliam, is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Mitch Cullin. It tells the story of Jeliza-Rose, a young girl who is abandoned by her drug-addicted parents and left to her own devices in a rural Texas landscape. Throughout the film, Jeliza-Rose relies on her imagination and a collection of dismembered Barbie doll heads to cope with her loneliness and fear. As you consider whether or not to invest in this film proposal, there are a few factors to consider. One of the most important considerations is the potential audience and marketability of the film. Tideland is a dark, surreal, and somewhat disturbing film, which may limit its mainstream appeal. However, the film's unique visual style, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes could attract a cult following and resonate with niche audiences who appreciate unconventional cinema. Another factor to consider is the experience and track record of the filmmakers and creative team involved in the project. Director Terry Gilliam is known for his distinctive visual style and has a history of creating memorable, visually stunning films, such as Brazil and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. If you believe that the director's vision for the film aligns with your own and that they have the ability to bring this complex story to life on screen, this could be an indicator of potential success for the project. Additionally, consider the costs associated with producing the film, including the budget, location, special effects (if any), and marketing expenses. Weigh these costs against the potential financial return and overall artistic value of the project to make an informed decision about whether or not to invest. Finally, take into account the story's themes, such as the exploration of grief, loneliness, and the power of imagination. These themes may resonate with certain audiences, making their investment of time and money in the film worthwhile. In summary, to determine whether or not to invest in the film proposal for Tideland, consider factors such as its marketability, the creative team behind it, production costs, and the potential emotional impact of the story on audiences. By assessing these elements, you can make a more informed decision about whether this film project aligns with your investment goals and artistic vision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This massive restoration project has brought forth the expertise of specialized teams from various states, all of whom have stepped up to tackle this monumental challenge. This recent power outage has been due to the severe cold front that swept across the northeast, leaving millions of residents without power. The impact of the relentlessly cold weather on infrastructures has led to ice accumulating over power lines and other electrical equipment, causing damage and rendering them non-operational. In response to this crisis, utility companies have been scrambling to assemble experienced crews to restore power to the affected areas as expeditiously as possible. These workers have been braving sub-zero temperatures and icy winds to climb tall transmission poles, traverse slippery surfaces, and reach remote locations, all in an effort to return power to their fellow citizens. They have been working long hours in darkness with impaired visibility, an added challenge that has pushed these professionals to their limits. In addition to working in these brutal conditions, these crews have had to diligently follow safety protocols to minimize risks associated with this complex task. Unfortunately, the harsh winter weather has created a sense of urgency that sometimes leads to potentially hazardous shortcuts. As experts and crews work against the clock to repair the damaged infrastructures, they must not compromise on safety measures, understanding that the icy conditions are exponentially more perilous than their regular operations. The efforts of these brave professionals have not gone unnoticed. There is immense appreciation and gratitude from the individuals and communities who have had their power restored. The dedicated personnel from various departments, including emergency response teams, local authorities, and utility companies, have banded together in a show of solidarity to support the citizens of the northeast during such challenging times. Even more inspiring are the stories of crew members who have traveled long distances from other regions, defying the logistical obstacles posed by the winter storm, to lend their help to this massive restoration effort. These selfless acts of service highlight the level of compassion, resilience, and teamwork that has emerged during these difficult circumstances. It is through this united front that the country has witnessed several neighborhoods and cities slowly returning to normalcy. Despite the extreme cold, the fierce determination and relentless perseverance of these dedicated crews have allowed them to make significant advancements in the restoration of power to a large proportion of those affected. However, the battle is far from over, as more challenging conditions are expected in the coming days which puts additional pressure on the crews to restore the remaining areas as quickly as possible. The approaching storms may present even more challenges to those working hard to restore power, testing their resolve even further. In these troubled times, the brave efforts of these crews, as they fight the cold and ice, serve as a heartwarming reminder of the human spirit's unwavering determination to overcome adversity and work together for the greater good. They represent the true power of collaboration and the indomitable spirit of workers who are striving to make a difference that directly impacts the lives of millions of their fellow Americans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence \\"Tom baked cookies yesterday.\\" has a low textual similarity (rating it 1 out of 5) to \\"Syrian opposition reports 'massacre'\\" because it differs in all these aspects: 1. Topic similarity: The original sentence talks about a political topic (Syrian Opposition and massacre) whereas the proposed sentence talks about baking, a completely unrelated topic. 2. Semantic similarity: The original sentence discusses a serious incident while the proposed sentence discusses an everyday, mundane action. The sentences convey vastly different meanings. 3. Syntactic similarity: The original sentence uses direct speech ('massacre') and an active voice. The new sentence, however, is a simple, declarative sentence without any direct speech and uses the past simple tense. These differences significantly reduce the textual similarity between the two sentences."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What industry was hit by a global depression? , can you please find it? The Kingdom of Mysore reached a peak in economic power under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, in the post-Mughal era of the mid-late 18th century. They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithing, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.The Mysore silk industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it however revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.Under Tipu Sultan, Mysore enjoyed one of the world's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century, higher than Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than 400 (1990 international dollars), or 2,000 per capita.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. Your job is to determine if the two sentences clearly agree/disagree with each other, or if this can't be determined. Indicate your answer as yes or no respectively.

Usage: Sentence 1 is \\"Ca'daan awoke and hid behind a bush to move his bowels.\\" Here, Ca'daan wakes up and decides to go behind a bush to relieve himself. Sentence 2 is \\"Ca'daan was embarrassed about what he was doing,\\" suggesting that Ca'daan felt some negative emotions about his action. From these sentences, we deduce that Ca'daan performed an action and felt embarrassed about it. Part #2: Find out if the two sentences agree or disagree with each other. Usage: In both sentences, the action performed by Ca'daan (going behind a bush to relieve himself) is depicted. In Sentence 1, no indication of how Ca'daan feels about his action is given, while in Sentence 2, it is specified that Ca'daan feels embarrassed. As such, Sentence 1 neither agrees nor disagrees with Sentence 2 on the aspect of Ca'daan's emotions. Part #3: Determine if the agreement/disagreement can be clearly determined and indicate your answer as yes or no. Usage: The answer here is \\"No.\\" While the two sentences relate to the same action by the same character, the first sentence does not provide information on how Ca'daan feels about his actions, which is the main focus of the second sentence.

They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement. What are the two types of Ion gauges?","completion":"The two types of Ion gauges are hot cathode and cold cathode."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan.

Answer the question When someone plays the flute, sound is produced because the air in the flute is Choices: -hot. -neutral. -vibrating. -vaporizing.","completion":"When someone plays the flute, sound is produced because the air in the flute is vibrating. To understand this, we must first discuss the basic principles of sound production and the mechanisms of how a flute works. Sound is a form of mechanical energy that travels as a wave through a medium, such as air, water, or solid objects. These waves are produced due to the vibration of particles in the medium. When an object vibrates, it causes the particles around it to vibrate as well, creating a chain reaction that propagates the sound wave through the medium. The flute is a musical instrument in the woodwind family. It is a reedless, edge-blown instrument, which means that the sound is produced by the player blowing air across the opening of the flute, called the embouchure hole. This action causes the air inside the flute to vibrate and create a sound wave. Now, let's break this process down to gain a deeper understanding. 1. Blowing air: The player directs a focused air stream towards the edge of the embouchure hole. This air stream can be controlled by the player's lips, resulting in variations of intensity, pitch, and tonal quality in the sound produced. 2. The embouchure hole: The embouchure hole is where the air stream interacts with the flute. The edge of the hole acts as a splitting point, causing the air stream to split into two parts. One part goes into the flute, while the other part continues outside. This interaction generates a series of pressure fluctuations inside the flute. 3. Air column vibration: The pressure fluctuations create a standing wave inside the air column of the flute. This standing wave is responsible for vibrating the column of air inside the instrument. The specific combination of air pressure and flute materials provides the unique resonance characteristics that give the flute its distinctive sound. 4. Sound production: As the column of air vibrates, sound waves travel through the air as pressure variations. This pressure variation can be detected by our ears, and we perceive this as sound. 5. Changing the pitch: A flute player can change the pitch of the produced sound by covering and uncovering the finger holes along the body of the instrument. This action alters the effective length of the air column inside the flute, causing the vibrating air to produce different frequencies and resulting in different musical notes. In conclusion, when someone plays the flute, the sound is produced because the air in the flute is vibrating, rather than being hot, neutral, or vaporizing. The process involves an intricate combination of the player's air stream, the embouchure hole, and the vibrating air column inside the instrument to create the beautiful and distinctive sound of a flute."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
