Movie title: Young Soul Rebels Context: The action centres on several themes firstly a homosexual murder investigation involving one of the central characters (Valentine Nonyela) and his relationship with his girlfriend (Sophie Okonedo). The second narrative involves a gay punk (Jason Durr) and a soul boy (Mo Sesay) in a relationship, which is the source of the narrative conflict as they face double prejudice of racism and homophobia, in both West Indian and white British communities. Ultimately, The film is a love story that could be seen as an allegory for racial and class unity, as their love transcends class and race barriers. Set in London in 1977, the plot takes place against the background of the Silver Jubilee. This is a buddy movie between two friends, Chris and Caz, who run a pirate radio station from a tower block in Dalston, East London. The film starts with a murder of their friend TJ while cruising for sex in the local park at night and, while Caz is cut up by the death of his friend, Chris seems to want to push forward towards a professional career in commercial radio. They both want to promote soul music while the prevailing popular music is punk.Chris meets Tracy at the recording studio and persuades her to get his audition tape heard but he is not ready to sell out his identity to get a job in the mainstream. Caz meets a punk Billibud who talks about communism and the Socialist Workers Party, while wearing (admittedly nicked) Vivienne Westwood designer T-shirts. The murder and the different paths they seem to be taking causes tension between the buddies Chris and Caz. Chris discovers that he has a tape recorded of the murder but fails to hand it in as evidence. He is then pulled in by the police as a suspect because he was in possession of TJ's cassette radio. He tries to call Caz but Caz is busy with his new boyfriend and trying to get a bigger aerial for their pirate radio station. He calls Tracy and she helps him to get a solicitor.

These shocking images of a little boy shot in the head have emerged hours after Syrian president Bashar Assad claimed his army was only targeting terrorists. The boy is from the Bayada neighbourhood of Homs, northeast of the capital, Damascus. He was wounded in the head after he was allegedly hit by the Syrian army during the recent uprisings in his hometown. The projectile entered the back of his head and can be seen lodged above his left eye. Shocking: A large bulge can be seen above Mohammed's left eye. He was allegedly hit by the Syrian army. Blood can be seen coming from the wound in the back of the youngster's head. Warning: Syrian president Bashar Assad has said his country is different to others where similar uprisings have occurred. In his first interview with a Western. paper, published in the Sunday Telegraph, Assad claimed that he was a. popular president and added that his army was only now targeting. terrorists. During the. interview Assad also warned Western intervention against his regime. would cause an 'earthquake' that would 'burn the whole region'. President Assad said the action could lead to 'another Afghanistan'. Defying worldwide condemnation of his actions, he said any outside aggression would ‘burn the whole region’. Assad's ultimatum came as hundreds of demonstrators marched to the Syrian embassy in London to show solidarity with victims of the seven-month uprising. In a two-hour rally outside the building in Belgrave Square, protesters chanted ‘get out Assad’ and ‘free Syria’. Activists claim Syrian forces killed more than 50 civilians in violent clashes over the weekend. At least 3,000 people – including 200 children – have died during the unrest. Thirty soldiers also died in fierce fighting in the city of Homs and in an ambush in the northern province of Idlib on Saturday. Assad conceded that the West would ‘ratchet up the pressure’ but said his country was different ‘in every respect’ from Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen, where other rebellions had taken place. Home: The Syrian president lives in Damascus and claims he is popular with his people because he lives an ordinary life. Assad lives a relatively modest life-style and claims this has made him popular with his people. He lives in Damascus with his wife Asma and their three children in a small, but guarded house in an ordinary street. The president, who can regularly be seen on the school run, said he lives a normal life and even drives his own car. ‘Syria is the hub now in this region. It is the fault line and if you play with the ground you will cause an. earthquake,’ he said. ‘Do you want to see another Afghanistan, or tens of Afghanistans? Any problem in Syria will burn the whole region. If the plan is to divide Syria, that. is to divide the whole region.’ He admitted his forces made ‘many. mistakes’ at the start of the uprising, but claimed only ‘terrorists’ were being targeted now. Assad also claimed his modest. lifestyle made him a popular leader. ‘The first component of popular. legitimacy is your personal life. It is very important how you live,’ he. said. ‘I drive my own car, we have neighbours, I take my kids to school. That’s why I’m popular.’ Unrest: Protesters burn images of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a protest earlier this month. Unpopular: Britain, France, the U.S, the United Nations and the Arab League have spoken out against the Syrian president. The president made his remarks as demands grew for a Libya-style no-fly zone over Syria. The resilience of the protesters, the. determination of the authorities to crush dissent and the growing armed. insurgency have combined to make Syria’s turmoil one of the most. intractable confrontations of this year’s Arab uprisings. Western governments have called on. the country’s embattled leader to step down, and have already imposed. sanctions on Syrian oil exports and state businesses. President Assad insisted his response. to the Arab Spring was not one of ‘stubborn government’, adding: ‘Six. days after (the protests began) I commenced reform.’ He also insisted. the pace of reform was ‘not too slow’. The latest wave of violence was met. with strong criticism from the Arab League, which issued a statement. expressing ‘disgust’ at the killing of civilians. An Arab League committee was due to meet a Syrian delegation in Qatar yesterday to discuss ways to solve the crisis. Britain, France, the U.S and the United Nations have all openly criticised the Syrian president over the past few months. The Arab League also sent a message to Assad and said they hoped the government would try to protect its citizens. One. of the protest leaders told the Sunday Telegraph said that protesters. were not calling for economic reform but wanted Assad out, followed by. free elections.

It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. Paragraph: John is a doctor with the local hospital. Earlier today, he was seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John found out that patient A had more LDL, but patient B had more HDL. He now needs to determine correct treatment for them. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would see less build up in the inner walls of the arteries, patient A or patient B? Answer:","completion":"Patient B would see less build up in the inner walls of the arteries. This is because Patient B has higher levels of HDL (high-density lipoprotein), which is known as \\"good\\" cholesterol. HDL helps remove LDL (\\"bad\\" cholesterol) from the bloodstream, reducing the risk of plaque formation and atherosclerosis, which could lead to heart attacks or strokes. On the other hand, Patient A has more LDL cholesterol, which is more likely to accumulate in the arterial walls and contribute to plaque formation, thus increasing the risk of heart-related issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the beginning of his career in the 1980s, Süskind has captivated readers with his unique blend of magical and surreal elements within his works while maintaining a firm grounding in reality. Süskind first came to prominence with his play, \\"Der Kontrabaß\\" (\\"The Double Bass\\"), which premiered in 1981. The one-man show explores the often overlooked life of a double bass player in an orchestra and marks the beginning of Süskind's experimentation with the use of the unique narrative style that has come to characterize his work. In 1985, Süskind published his most well-known work, \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer.\\" This novel tells the dark and haunting tale of a gifted but morally corrupt perfumer in 18th-century France who seeks to create the ultimate fragrance by murdering young women and extracting their scent. \\"Perfume\\" was adapted into a successful film in 2006, further solidifying Süskind's reputation as a gifted storyteller. Other notable works by Patrick Süskind include the novellas \\"The Pigeon\\" (1987) and \\"The Story of Mr. Sommer\\" (1991). \\"The Pigeon\\" is a psychological study of a man's sudden crisis after encountering a seemingly innocuous pigeon, while \\"The Story of Mr. Sommer\\" is a coming-of-age tale centered around a mysterious man who unexpectedly appears in a small town. Throughout his career, Süskind has been noted for his ability to evoke vivid and imaginative worlds within his writing, a characteristic that has earned him a dedicated following. He has made significant contributions to the magic realism movement, which combines elements of the fantastical with elements of the everyday to create unique and thought-provoking narratives.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available options: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"It is essential to treat each individual's opinions and beliefs with respect, even if you may not agree with them entirely. Feminism is a social and political movement advocating for equal rights and opportunities for women in various aspects of life. While some people might get frustrated or tired of hearing about this topic, it is essential to understand that the core idea is to promote equality, which benefits everyone. Regarding your query about water intake during your physical exercise and home stay, it is recommended that you listen to your body's needs and adjust your water consumption accordingly. Since you mentioned that you have different schedules for your exercise and home stay, your water requirements might also vary for each situation. Firstly, let's discuss the ideal amount of water that you should be consuming for each case: 1. Physical Exercise: When you engage in physical activities, your body loses water through sweating, which needs to be replenished to stay hydrated. It is generally advised to drink water before, during, and after exercise, depending on the intensity and duration of the activity. A rough guideline is to drink about 500ml (17 ounces) of water two hours before exercising, 7-10 ounces (200-295ml) every 10-20 minutes during the activity, and around 16-24 ounces (450-700ml) of water for every pound (0.5 kg) of body weight lost during exercise. 2. Home Stay: If you are not engaging in high-intensity activities during your home stay, your water intake might be lower than during exercise. The popular '8x8 rule' suggests drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, equivalent to 2 liters or half a gallon. However, the actual amount may vary depending on factors such as age, gender, health, and climate, among others. An individual's daily water requirement can range from 2.5 liters to 3.5 liters, including water from food and other beverages. Now, let's address the multi-choice problem. The two questions inquire about different topics. The first question pertains to opinions on feminism, while the second concerns water intake during physical exercise and home stay.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

This comes as a welcome sign of an improvement in the country's trade balance, offering a positive outlook for the nation's economic health. Trade deficit refers to the difference between the value of a country's imports and exports. A narrowing trade deficit indicates that the value of exports is rising or the value of imports is declining, essentially meaning the UK is exporting more goods and selling its products more than it is importing or buying from other countries. A lowered trade deficit can positively impact the country's economy and currency value. The ONS's report on the narrowed deficit offered insights into the driving factors behind this change. The overall value of exports increased by £1.9 billion while imports fell by £0.1 billion. The services sector played a significant role in contributing to the reduction of the trade gap, as exports in this sector witnessed a rise and imports saw little change. Additionally, the export of goods to non-EU countries saw an increase, which is particularly noteworthy in the context of the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the post-Brexit future of the UK. This highlights the potential for the country to strengthen trading partnerships on a global scale, beyond its reliance on the European Union. Another contributing factor to the narrowing of the trade deficit was the increased demand for British goods from various foreign markets, driven in part by the government's efforts to boost the production and export of UK-made products. Initiatives like the \\"Made in Britain\\" campaign and increased support for small businesses have helped bolster the country's reputation as a producer of quality goods, propelling demand for these products in international markets. It is essential to maintain this positive trend to cope with the financial changes the nation is facing due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Focusing on increasing the export of goods and services, supporting industries, and fostering relationships with emerging markets can contribute to a balanced trade system and overall economic growth. Moreover, the government's role in shaping and driving policies that favor the promotion and development of domestic industries is crucial. Offering economic support to British companies and reducing trade barriers where possible, facilitating increased exports, and ensuring fair trading practices will help to maintain the momentum behind this promising progress in lowering the UK's trade deficit. However, it is important to also consider external factors that may pose a challenge to the UK's trade balance in the future. Global economic fluctuations, currency value changes, and the still-uncertain outcome of Brexit negotiations may all have an effect on the achievement of long-term goals to reduce the trade deficit significantly. In conclusion, the reduction of the UK's trade deficit in April 2021 is a strong indicator of potential improvement in the country's economic health. By focusing on building stronger trade ties with non-EU countries and supporting domestic industries, the UK can continue to work towards a more balanced and sustainable economic future. The government's role in driving policies that enable these changes and its awareness of external challenges will determine the country's success in maintaining a narrowed trade deficit in the coming months and years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. it contains practical and well explained examples of: 1. standard deviation and mean 2. lotto number generator 3. Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","completion":"In this response, I will provide well-explained examples, containing practical applications of the mentioned concepts: 1) Standard Deviation and Mean, and 2) a Lotto Number Generator. 1. Standard Deviation and Mean: Standard deviation and mean are important statistical concepts that are widely used in various fields to analyze and interpret data. The mean (also known as average) gives us an idea about the central tendency, and standard deviation informs us about the spread or variability of the data. Example: Let's consider the test scores of ten students in a class: Scores: 75, 80, 69, 90, 78, 82, 92, 88, 74, 85 First, let's calculate the mean: Mean = (Sum of all scores)/Number of students Mean = (75 + 80 + 69 + 90 + 78 + 82 + 92 + 88 + 74 + 85)/10 Mean = 813/10 Mean = 81.3 Now, let's calculate the standard deviation: Step 1: Find the deviation of each score from the mean: 75 - 81.3 = -6.3 80 - 81.3 = -1.3 69 - 81.3 = -12.3 90 - 81.3 = 8.7 78 - 81.3 = -3.3 82 - 81.3 = 0.7 92 - 81.3 = 10.7 88 - 81.3 = 6.7 74 - 81.3 = -7.3 85 - 81.3 = 3.7 Step 2: Square the deviations: (-6.3)^2 = 39.69 (-1.3)^2 = 1.69 (-12.3)^2 = 151.29 (8.7)^2 = 75.69 (-3.3)^2 = 10.89 (0.7)^2 = 0.49 (10.7)^2 = 114.49 (6.7)^2 = 44.89 (-7.3)^2 = 53.29 (3.7)^2 = 13.69 Step 3: Calculate the mean of these squared deviations: Mean = (Sum of squared deviations)/Number of students Mean = (39.69 + 1.69 + 151.29 + 75.69 + 10.89 + 0.49 + 114.49 + 44.89 + 53.29 + 13.69) / 10 Mean = 505.10 / 10 Mean = 50.51 Step 4: Take the square root of the mean: Standard Deviation = √50.51 Standard Deviation ≈ 7.11 So, the mean test score is 81.3 and the standard deviation is approximately 7.11. 2. Lotto Number Generator: A lotto number generator is a tool or function that generates random numbers within the specified range, generally used in lottery games. In most lotto games, unique numbers are drawn randomly from a finite set without replacement. Example: Let's create a simple Python program to generate six unique random numbers between 1 and 49 for a lotto game: \`\`\`python import random def generate_lotto_numbers(): lotto_numbers = set() while len(lotto_numbers) < 6: number = random.randint(1, 49) lotto_numbers.add(number) return sorted(lotto_numbers) print(\\"Lotto numbers:\\", generate_lotto_numbers()) \`\`\` This program uses Python's built-in random.randint() function to generate random integers. It creates a set to store the unique numbers and loops until it has collected six unique numbers. Finally, it returns the sorted list of lotto numbers. Upon running the program, you will get an output like: Lotto numbers: [5, 17, 23, 30, 42, 46] Please keep in mind that this is just one example of a lotto number generator, and various other implementations can be used depending on the specific requirements of the lottery game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2014, Hubbard was cited by the Smithsonian magazine as one of the 100 most significant Americans of all time, as one of the eleven religious figures on that list. After establishing a career as a writer, becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories, he developed a system called Dianetics which was first expounded in book form in May 1950. He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology. His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation. The Church's dissemination of these materials led to Hubbard being listed by the \\"Guinness Book of World Records\\" as the most translated and published author in the world.

In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Prior to becoming king, Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire. - The Church of Scientology is a multinational network and hierarchy of numerous ostensibly independent but interconnected corporate entities and other organizations devoted to the practice, administration and dissemination of Scientology, a new religious movement. The Church of Scientology International (CSI) is officially the Church of Scientology's parent organization, and is responsible for guiding local Scientology churches. At a local level, every church is a separate corporate entity set up as a licensed franchise and has its own board of directors and executives. The first Scientology church was incorporated in December 1953 in Camden, New Jersey by L. Ron Hubbard. Its international headquarters are located at the Gold Base, in an unincorporated area of Riverside County, California. The location at Gilman Hotsprings is kept secret from most Scientologists.

Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour.

If Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master. , can we conclude that \\"Imagination has some good and bad things about it.\\"?","completion":"Certainly, one can reasonably conclude that \\"Imagination has some good and bad things about it\\" based on the statement \\"Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master.\\" To understand this conclusion, let's delve deeper into the roles of imagination as both a servant and a master, along with the positive and negative aspects associated with each role. Imagination as a good servant entails its capacity to positively impact our lives in various ways when properly harnessed. As a servant, imagination offers several advantages: 1. Creativity: Imagination drives creativity, allowing individuals to come up with novel ideas, artistic expressions, and innovative solutions to problems. Creative thinking is vital to personal and professional growth, as well as the advancement of human society. 2. Empathy: Imagination enables us to understand other people's emotions, thoughts, and experiences by placing ourselves in their shoes. This fosters empathy, which is essential for building strong relationships and promoting social harmony. 3. Motivation: Imagination plays a pivotal role in setting and achieving goals by visualizing desired outcomes and the steps necessary to realize them. This mental imagery can boost motivation and self-confidence by fostering a belief in one's abilities and the likelihood of success. 4. Problem-solving: Employing imagination as a servant also assists in effective problem-solving and decision-making since it helps us visualize possible scenarios and weigh their consequences. This ability encourages logical reasoning, critical thinking, and calculated risk-taking. However, when imagination becomes a bad master, it can lead to negative consequences and can sometimes hinder an individual's overall well-being and functioning. Some potential drawbacks of imagination as a master include: 1. Overthinking: When imagination runs rampant, it can lead to overthinking and the analysis paralysis wherein individuals become excessively preoccupied with various possibilities, worries, and doubts, making it difficult to take action or make decisions. 2. Anxiety and fear: An unrestrained imagination can exacerbate anxiety and fear by causing people to envision worst-case scenarios or catastrophic outcomes that might not necessarily be grounded in reality. This heightened sense of impending doom can harm psychological well-being and impede an individual's ability to function optimally. 3. Procrastination: Sometimes, a wild imagination can lead to daydreaming and escapism, making it difficult for individuals to focus on their responsibilities and tasks. Consequently, this impact on productivity can lead to procrastination, missed deadlines, and unfulfilled potential. 4. Distorted perceptions: An overactive imagination can distort an individual's perceptions of reality, leading to erroneous beliefs, biases, and misconceptions. These distorted views can contribute to conflict and misunderstanding in relationships and can even impede the ability to make appropriate judgments in various situations. In conclusion, while the statement \\"Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master\\" highlights the duality of imagination's impact on our lives, it is essential to recognize that its positive or negative influence largely depends on how we utilize and manage it. By consciously harnessing our imaginative powers as a tool for creativity, problem-solving, empathy, and motivation, we can foster personal growth and cultivate meaningful connections with others. However, it's crucial to be aware of the potential pitfalls associated with an unrestrained imagination - namely overthinking, anxiety, procrastination, and distorted perceptions - and take necessary steps to mitigate these negative effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Nylon pick from the following. - can build comfortable underwear to wear. - can build fire retardant suits to wear.","completion":"When considering which of the following solutions is better for the goal of creating nylon products, it is important to assess the specific needs and demands of the intended application. Both solutions—comfortable underwear and fire-retardant suits—serve different purposes and cater to diverse functions. To thoroughly evaluate these options, let's analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both applications in the context of nylon usage. 1. Comfortable Underwear: Advantages: - Nylon is known for its lightweight, smooth, and soft texture, making it ideal for creating comfortable underwear that doesn't cause skin irritation. - The fabric is known for its exceptional moisture-wicking capabilities, so nylon underwear can help keep the wearer dry and comfortable throughout the day. - Due to its durability and resistance to abrasion, nylon underwear can retain its shape and last longer than underwear made from other types of fibers. - The material is easy to care for, typically requiring only a cold machine wash and gentle tumble dry. Disadvantages: - Nylon is not as breathable as natural fabrics like cotton, which can lead to potential discomfort for some users in warmer climates or for those who prefer more breathable materials. - It is a synthetic fabric derived from petroleum, making it less eco-friendly compared to natural fibers. 2. Fire-Retardant Suits: Advantages: - Due to its heat-resistance properties, nylon can be treated with fire-retardant chemicals to make it suitable for protective clothing, such as fire-retardant suits. - Fire-retardant nylon suits can provide adequate protection against heat, chemical exposure, and flame hazards in high-risk environments. - The fabric's inherent strength and durability make it an excellent choice for workwear in extreme conditions, as it can withstand regular wear and tear despite constant exposure to harsh surroundings. - When compared to other fire-retardant materials, nylon tends to be more comfortable and lightweight, which can be beneficial for workers required to wear such clothing for extended periods. Disadvantages: - Despite its ability to be treated with fire-retardant chemicals, nylon can still melt when exposed to extremely high temperatures, which may not provide sufficient protection in certain applications. - The production process of fire-retardant nylon can be more complicated and expensive than producing ordinary nylon. - The chemicals used to treat fire-retardant clothing are not always eco-friendly or biodegradable, raising potential concerns for health and environmental impact.

MIDLOTHIAN, Texas (AP) — The man charged in the killings of six people at an East Texas campsite had earlier befriended the victims and helped dislodge one of their vehicles from mud, a sheriff said Tuesday.

(Associated Press) William Hudson, 33, spent time with the group Saturday and then returned hours later and killed them all, though authorities have not said how, Anderson County Sheriff Greg Taylor said. Taylor declined to elaborate on the attack or a motive, but said Tuesday that there were \\"several different crime scenes.\\" The victims were part of a blended family that had come from as far away as California for a weekend together to camp on wooded land that 46-year-old Thomas Kamp had purchased in August, according to Steven Woodruff, who was Kamp's uncle. The land was adjacent to property owned by Hudson and his family about 100 miles southeast of Dallas, Taylor said. Kamp had lived for several years in Midlothian, south of Dallas, with Hannah Johnson, 40, and her 6-year-old son Kade. They were joined last weekend by Johnson's parents, Carl and Cynthia Johnson, and Kamp's two sons from a previous marriage, Nathan and Austin Kamp, who were California residents. The family also was celebrating Nathan Kamp's 24th birthday. Cynthia Johnson escaped the attack and hid in woods before calling 911 for help. \\"Nothing can describe the pain and sorrow of the remaining family members,\\" Woodruff told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon. Two of the victims were found by sheriff's deputies in a travel camper. The other bodies, including Kade's, were later pulled from a pond about a half-mile away. \\"I've been in law enforcement for 31 years and I've never seen anything like this,\\" Taylor said. One of Hannah Johnson's friends, Michael Gilbert, said she grew up and attended school in Maine and later lived in suburban Boston before moving to Texas to be closer to her parents, who had retired there. \\"She loved it down there and was really happy,\\" he said in a phone interview, adding that she found a job she liked with an insurance company in Fort Worth. Gilbert said she enjoyed camping and about a year ago bought an Airstream travel camper that she had long coveted. It wasn't clear if two of the bodies found Sunday morning were discovered in that camper or one owned by Johnson's parents. Hudson is charged with one count of murder, and more are pending. It was not clear whether Hudson, who's being held on 2.5 million bond at the Anderson County jail, had an attorney who could comment on the allegations. Hudson was apprehended at his mother's house, next door to his own home. ___ Stengle reported from Midlothian and Warren from Dallas.

(CNN)As \\"Mad Men\\" returned for its seventh season, many viewers tuned in to see what happened next for Don, Peggy, Pete and the other characters of the hit AMC show. Many were eager to see the fabulous clothes the actors wore. We can't help but wonder -- was all that glamour real, or is it just the magic of TV? We asked readers to share their snapshots from 1967-69 and show us what the late '60s really looked like. Janie Lambert, 61, says she thinks \\"Mad Men\\" portrays the decade's conservative fashion and mod look accurately. But she remembers the late 1960s as more colorful and vibrant. \\"My favorite looks in the '60s were the bright colors and bold patterns, stripes and polka dots, miniskirts, long hair and pale lipstick,\\" Lambert says. 'Mad Men' and the other 1960s Many iReporters strived to keep up with the fast pace of the changing fashion in the late '60s. Patricia Anne Alfano, 66, went from a British-inspired mod style cheerleader to a hippie in a matter of three years. In 1967, Alfano was an \\"Eaglette\\" -- an NFL cheerleader for the Philadelphia Eagles. Unlike today, the cheerleaders were covered from head to toe. The uniforms had long sleeves, and the cheerleaders wore gloves and cloth helmets. \\"From the early 1960s until 1967, I spent tons of time on my hair,\\" she says, noting her mod hairdo in the picture is actually a wig. \\"Wigs were big back then. Everyone had at least one.\\" In 1968, the style began to evolve. Alfano still spent a lot of time on her hair, but her peers began heavily criticizing all things materialistic, so the style became more casual. 1. What TV show is returning? 2.

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Intellectual property (IP) is a product of the mind that has commercial value. The concept dates back to 1623, when the first patent law to protect IP rights was passed. IP rights protect an artist from having his/her creative ideas copied by another. For example, if somebody generated an idea for a novel, that idea is protected by IP rights. If someone else wishes to represent the idea or develop it further, he/she must consult the original artists, who will normally be rewarded financially for its use. Back in the 17thcentury, IP rights were primarily carried out to protect newly developed manufacturing processes against stealing, but today intellectual property rights are also enjoyed by those who create music, art and literature. In recent years, IP rights have been the focus of a great deal of discussion because of a technology which looks set to weaken them altogether: the Internet. Many years ago, if you wanted a recoding of a song, you would have to purchase it from a music store; if a novel, from a book store. In those days, IP rights were easily protected since it was very difficult to obtain intellectual property without paying for it. However, a lot of IP, including songs, films, books and artwork, can be downloaded today free of charge using the internet. This practice has now taken the world by storm, dramatically affecting the way in which we view IP rights. Question: What do we know about the Internet according to the passage? Answer: OPTIONS: A). It does not affect the way we understand IP rights.; B). It sells songs and films.; C). It makes IP rights harder to protect.; D). It prevents the production of artwork.;","completion":"Answer: C).

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What kind of cells divide out of control?\\" with the following options: - bacteria - parasites - humans - white blood - blood - stem cells - dangerous - cancer Answer:","completion":"Cancer cells divide out of control in the human body. Among the options provided, \\"cancer\\" is the appropriate term to describe the kind of cells that divide uncontrollably. Cancer is a disease that affects the body's cells, as mentioned in fact 2. The normal process of cell division and growth is disrupted in cancer, leading to an uncontrolled division and proliferation of cells. This can result in the formation of tumors and other complications, as the abnormal cells spread to various parts of the body. It's important to distinguish cancer cells from the other options listed, as they each have distinct characteristics and roles in the biological world: - Bacteria: These are single-celled microorganisms that can be either beneficial or harmful to humans. While certain bacterial infections can increase the risk of developing cancer, bacteria themselves are not cancer cells. - Parasites: Organisms that live on or within another organism (the host) and derive nutrients at the host's expense. Parasites can sometimes cause diseases, but they are not cancer cells. - Humans: Humans are multicellular organisms that consist of various types of cells with different functions. Cancer cells are a subset of human cells that have undergone specific mutations and continue to divide uncontrollably. - White blood cells: These are cells in the human immune system that help protect the body against infections and diseases. White blood cells themselves are not cancer cells, although the uncontrolled growth of white blood cells could lead to certain types of blood cancer, such as leukemia. - Blood cells: This term encompasses both red and white blood cells, which serve multiple functions within the body like providing oxygen and immunity. Blood cells are not synonymous with cancer cells, although blood cancers do exist. - Stem cells: Undifferentiated cells in the body that can give rise to specialized cell types. Stem cells are not cancer cells themselves, but mutations in these cells can sometimes lead to the development of cancer. - Dangerous: This term is not a specific type of cell; rather, it describes the potential harm that cancer cells can inflict on the human body due to their uncontrolled growth and spread. In conclusion, based on the given facts, cancer cells are the kind that divide out of control. These cells are a subset of human cells that experience genetic mutations, which cause them to grow and spread throughout the body in an uncontrolled manner, often leading to significant health problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ed Miliband and wife Justine chose a three-year-old apple tree. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Royal Couple's Charitable Request Inspires Unique Gifts from Party Leaders In anticipation of their nuptial celebration, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Kate and William, made a thoughtful and charitable request. Instead of the traditional wedding presents, they asked their esteemed guests to make donations to their preferred charities. This extraordinary display of altruism demonstrates the couple's dedication to using their influence for the betterment of society and highlights their commitment to the welfare of others. Their request, however, did not deter some of Britain's most prominent party leaders from surprising the royal couple with distinctive and meaningful gifts. The selection of presents is not only a testament to the donor's creativity but also a reflection of their understanding of the couple's interests, desires, and needs. Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, who are known for their love of literature, gifted Kate and William a box-set of books by renowned British author Roald Dahl. This collection, including classic titles such as \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" and \\"Matilda,\\" is an ideal gift for the royal couple who are avid readers themselves. The timeless stories of Dahl will not only provide entertainment and inspiration to Kate and William, but will become cherished pieces in their personal library to be read aloud and passed on for generations. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his wife, Miriam, opted for a more practical and thoughtful gift for the newlyweds. Understanding the hectic and sleepless life of the royals, they presented Kate and William with a high-quality blanket and a set of coffee, to provide warmth and comfort during their sleepless nights. The gift encapsulates the couple's compassionate nature, wishing Kate and William both relaxation and resilience as they face the demanding lifestyle that accompanies their royal roles. Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife, Justine, chose to gift the couple a living reminder of their union—a three-year-old apple tree. This symbolic offering represents the fruitfulness of their marriage, as well as the growth and nurturing of their relationship over time. The apple tree is a living testament to Kate and William's enduring love and commitment to each other. As it flourishes in their garden, the tree will serve as a vivid analogy of their own growth and resilience. The royal couple's charitable request and the unique gifts presented by the country's party leaders symbolize values such as thoughtfulness, creativity, and generosity. They serve as a reminder of the shared respect and admiration that exists between Kate, William, and the political leaders of their nation.

The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY or others will want what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonY and others, respectively. For example, as a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonY may want to open the gift.

These two phrases are separated by \\"<sep>\\". Part #2: short phrases involving participants with generic names. Usage: PersonX gives birth to PersonY, to cry Explanation: The phrases contain generic names such as PersonX, PersonY, or PersonZ as placeholders for specific individuals. In this example, PersonX gives birth to PersonY, and the Tail event is about crying. Part #3: PersonX is always the subject of the event. Usage: PersonX gives birth to PersonY Explanation: In the given Head phrase, PersonX is the subject who is performing the action (giving birth), thus fulfilling the criterion that PersonX is always the subject.

(CNN)The demands by terrorists for ransoms in return for kidnapped hostages continues and grows -- and it is a brave (some would say heartless) government that chooses non-payment over the lives of its citizens. This week's 200 million demand in return for the lives of two Japanese citizens perhaps represents a change of tactics from ISIS -- the group that now rules over large parts of Syria and Iraq -- as they realize that, with the notable exceptions of the U.S. and the UK, the willingness of Western nations to resist making some form of payment in the face of YouTube videos of their citizens begging for their lives is weak. Is an unwavering resistance towards ransom payments a constructive position to take? Is offering no hope of some form of negotiated settlement in the best interest of a nation's citizens? Or would it in fact make more sense to take a flexible approach that operates on a \\"case-by-case\\" basis, engages in negotiation, and considers all possible options including ransom? The arguments against payment are well-rehearsed and oft-repeated by those that attempt to hold the international line. Since 9/11 the attempt to starve terrorist organizations of financing has been a cornerstone of the global effort to counter these groups. Payment of ransoms to terrorist organizations for the safe return of citizens is thus entirely contrary to the blizzard of national and international laws and norms that have emerged. At a 2013 summit in Northern Ireland, world leaders noted that the \\"international community has made significant progress in combating the flow of funds to terrorist organizations,\\" but also drew attention to the substantial financial benefit being earned through ransom payments and the incentive this provided for further kidnappings. Following the G8 Summit, and notwithstanding the fact that in 2009 the U.N. reminded Member States of their obligation to prevent the payment of ransoms to terrorists under Security Council Resolution 1904, the Security Council passed a further resolution in January 2014 calling upon Member States \\"to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments.\\" Without doubt, paying ransoms encourages more kidnappings -- it is a self-perpetuating, self-reinforcing cycle. The U.S. administration argues that \\"hostage-takers looking for ransoms distinguish between those governments that pay ransoms and those that do not ... and make a point of not taking hostages from those countries that refuse to make concessions.\\" Be that as it may (and proving a counter-factual is always highly subjective), the murder in 2009 of British citizen Edwin Dyer by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- whilst his fellow Swiss and German captives were freed following the reported payment of a substantial ransom -- shows that refusing to pay is risky. Furthermore, the procession of gruesome beheadings visited on American and British hostages by ISIS in 2014 suggests that, in the knowledge that the U.S. and UK will not pay ransoms, captured citizens from these two countries are far more likely to be murdered in the pursuit of propaganda. A willingness to negotiate. While paying ransoms increases the risk of further kidnappings, it also clearly increases the likelihood of a safe and successful outcome. Offering to consider ransom demands introduces a critical prerequisite for success -- namely, a willingness to negotiate. The secretive world of kidnap-for-ransom (KfR, in industry parlance) insurance provides a source of instructive insight. This industry bloomed following the kidnap, ransom, and death of the 20-month old baby son of U.S. aviator Charles Lindbergh. At the heart of the growth and success of this niche industry is its ability to respond to and engage with kidnappers, normally via intermediaries. Success is judged not only by the safe return of a captured individual but also by the ability to negotiate a price that is far removed from the opening ask. Knowing that ransom payments to designated terrorist groups are illegal, KfR specialists will quickly pass insured situations involving terrorist groups to government authorities -- and the outcomes are rarely as favorable as those that can be achieved via expert negotiation. Periodically the facts presented to policymakers change and policymakers must adapt. Such a moment for adaptation has arrived. Kidnap-for-ransom is an increasingly widely-used tool by terrorist groups. Nasser al-Wuhayshi, leader of Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is estimated to have earned 20 million from ransom between 2011 and 2013, asserts that \\"kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil\\" and \\"a profitable trade and a precious treasure.\\" In several recorded messages, al Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri has called for supporters worldwide to kidnap Westerners. Stomach-churning (and illegal, in most jurisdictions) as it may be to finance designated terrorists, in recent months, citizens of France, Germany, Denmark, and Italy have returned safely home. Citizens of the UK and the U.S. have not. The point blank refusal to pay ransoms is wrong-headed. A more nuanced approach that leaves all options, including payment, open for negotiation is much more likely to result in success. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. Terrorist groups continue to demand ransoms for kidnapped hostages, putting governments in the difficult position of choosing between paying the ransom or risking the lives of their citizens. 2. Countries such as the US and UK maintain a strict policy against paying ransoms, as it may encourage more kidnappings and provide financial support to terrorist organizations. 3. The payment of ransoms is also against various national and international laws, including UN Security Council resolutions. 4. However, the refusal to pay ransoms may put citizens of countries with such a policy at a higher risk of being murdered for propaganda purposes. 5. Kidnap-for-ransom insurance specialists have found success in negotiating ransoms, leading to a safer return of hostages. 6. Some argue that a more nuanced approach that keeps all options, including ransom payments, open for negotiation may result in better outcomes for kidnapped citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Herb Jeffries (born Umberto Alexander Valentino; September 24, 1913 - May 25, 2014) was an African-American actor of film and television and popular music and jazz singer-songwriter, known of his baritone voice. He was of African descent and Hollywood's first singing black cowboy. In the 1940s and 1950s Jeffries recorded for a number of labels, including RCA Victor, Exclusive, Coral, Decca, Bethlehem, Columbia, Mercury and Trend. His album Jamaica, recorded by RKO, is a concept album of self-composed calypso songs. Touring the Deep South with Hines, Jeffries was struck by the realities of segregation, as the Orchestra's playing was restricted to tobacco warehouses and black-only movie theatres. Watching young boys fill theatres to watch the latest western, Jeffries resolved to create a cowboy hero geared specifically for such an audience. A self-confessed western buff who had grown up watching the silent escapades of Tom Mix and Jack Holt, in the 1930s Jeffries set out to produce a low-budget western with an all-black cast. Though the silent era had seen a number of films starring only black actors, they had all but disappeared with the economic downturn and the arrival of the talkies, which proved too expensive for many of the \\"white independents\\" funding such projects. Jeffries's ambition was to produce sound cinema's \\"first all-Negro musical western\\". To fund his project, Jeffries approached a veteran B-movie producer named Jed Buell. Jeffries, having obtained finances, wrote his own songs for the film and hired Spencer Williams to appear with him. When Buell wanted to know of a likely candidate for the lead role, Jeffries nominated himself. Having grown up partly on his grandfather's farm, he had all the requisite horse-riding and roping skills, beside a fine singing voice, but Buell expressed concerns; Jeffries, whose mother was of Irish descent, was \\"not black enough\\". Eventually they went ahead, using make-up to darken the leading man's skin tone. Jeffries made his debut as a crooning cowboy with Harlem on the Prairie, which was considered the first black western following the inauguration of the talkies and the first sound Western with an all-black cast. The movie was shot in 1937 over five days at N.B. Murray's Dude Ranch in Apple Valley, California, with Jeffries performing all his own stunts. Though critical reception was mixed, the film received a write-up in Time magazine and grossed 50,000 in its first 12 months. Playing a singing cowboy in low-budget films, Jeffries became known as the \\"Bronze Buckaroo\\" by his fans. In a time of American racial segregation, such \\"race movies\\" played mostly in theaters catering to African-American audiences. The films include Harlem on the Prairie, The Bronze Buckaroo, Harlem Rides the Range and Two-Gun Man from Harlem. Jeffries went on to star in another three musical westerns over the next two years. Jeffries starred as a singing cowboy, in several all-black Western films, in which he sang his own western compositions. In those films, Jeffries starred as cowboy Bob Blake, sang and performed his own stunts. Bob Blake was the good guy, with a thin mustache, who wore a white Stetson and rode a white horse named Stardusk. Jeffries went on to make other films, starring in the title film role of Calypso Joe co-starring Angie Dickinson in Calypso Joe (1957). In 1968, Jeffries appeared in the long-running western TV series The Virginian playing a gunslinger who intimidated the town. In the 1970s he appeared on episodes of I Dream of Jeannie and Hawaii Five-0. He later directed and produced Mundo depravados, a cult film starring his wife, Tempest Storm.

Coulton Waugh attempted the first comprehensive history of American comics with The Comics (1947). Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art (1985) and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics. David Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective. Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's. Eisner described what he called \\"sequential art\\" as \\"the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea\\"; Scott McCloud defined comics \\"juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer\\", a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings. R. C. Harvey defined comics as \\"pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa\\". Each definition has had its detractors. Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons, and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting \\"the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content\\". Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.

Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents.

Use the following highlights to write an article: George Robert Fout taught computer skills in Florida. 25-year-old faces child porn & sexual battery charges. 'Attacked Cub Scout twice a month for eight years' Article:","completion":"Title: Florida Computer Skills Instructor Charged with Child Porn and Sexual Battery, Targeted Cub Scout for Eight Years Introduction In a shocking revelation emerging from Florida, a 25-year-old computer skills instructor, George Robert Fout, has been charged with possession of child pornography and sexual battery on a minor below twelve years of age. The alleged educator, who had been teaching computer skills in the region, is accused of sexually assaulting a Cub Scout twice a month for a period of eight years. Details of the Case George Robert Fout, hailing from Florida, had been teaching computer skills to children in the region until suspicions around his illegal activities emerged. The alarming charges of child porn and sexual battery came to light after multiple allegations were raised against him. Fout now faces the wrath of the law as the police and legal system are working together to ensure that justice prevails. Chronicle of a Disturbing Pattern The heinous acts committed by Fout extended over a substantial period of eight years, as the victim, a young Cub Scout, was repeatedly targeted without any indication of the ongoing misconduct. The abuses reportedly took place twice a month for eight long years, highlighting the predator's relentless pursuit of the vulnerable child. It is speculated that Fout managed to carry out these grave acts by taking advantage of his position and access to young people. Consequences and Legal Ramifications Following the charges brought against George Robert Fout, he has been arrested and is now awaiting trial. The punishment for such heinous crimes, as stipulated by Florida law, includes lengthy prison sentences, fines, and mandatory registration as a sex offender, along with other potential penalties. Further Investigations and Protecting the Vulnerable While law enforcement continues its investigation into this case, the possibility of additional victims coming forward cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the details of the case – a trusted educator preying on a young, vulnerable child for an extended period – have generated immense concern among parents, caregivers, and members of the community. As a society, we must reflect on how to better protect our children and create a safer environment for them to grow and flourish. This necessitates raising awareness about the dangers of sexual predators targeting vulnerable youth, while also promoting the need for a comprehensive background check and screening process for individuals entrusted with children's care, such as educators, coaches, and counselors. Additionally, there needs to be an emphasis on educating children about their rights, personal boundaries, and the importance of reporting any unfamiliar or uncomfortable situation to a trusted adult. The combined efforts of families, schools, and the community can help ensure that the safety and well-being of our children remain the highest priority. Conclusion The case of George Robert Fout urges us to look into our society's responsibility towards our children, who deserve a secure and nurturing environment to thrive. By doing so, we can minimize the trauma and long-term implications of such incidents and foster a safer and more productive ecosystem for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Group S made a fire using large logs, while group F made a fire using small twigs and sawdust. Both groups used the same volume of wood. But I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. What is an answer for this question: Which group made a fire from smaller particles? A:","completion":"Group F made a fire from smaller particles. This can be deduced from the given information, which states that group S used large logs to create their fire, while group F used small twigs and sawdust. Small twigs and sawdust have a higher surface area compared to large logs, which means they are considered as smaller particles. As mentioned in the background information, an increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Due to the higher surface area and smaller size of twigs and sawdust, they will burn much more quickly than the large logs used by group S. Consequently, group F made a fire using smaller particles, which enabled a faster burning rate and higher reactivity compared to the fire made by group S. This concept is applicable not only to this specific situation but also to other instances where the surface area and size of the reactants play a crucial role in determining the reaction rate and outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yet foreign students,whether educated in British private schools or elsewhere,are decreasingly likely to go to English universities.According to the Higher Education Funding Council for England,307,200 overseas students began their studies in the country in 2012-13,down from 312,000 two years earlier and the first drop in 29 years.Student numbers from the rest of the European Union(EU)fell--probably a result of the increase in annual tuition fees in England from PS6,000(10,000)a year to PS9,000.But arrivals from India and Pakistan declined most sharply. In contrast to the visa system for private schools,which is extremely loose(the Home Office counts private schools as favoured sponsors),student visas have been tightened.Foreign students used to be allowed to work for up to two years after graduating.They now have only four months to find a job paying up to PS20,600 if they want to stay in Britain.

Then your man-of-the-match prize. It requires something special to shift the Welsh spotlight away from Gareth Bale, but on a night when the Real Madrid player did not quite produce his comic-book heroics, Crystal Palace's second choice staopper earned his nation a point with a performance that defied logic as much as the Bosnian attack on Friday night. Out from the Selhurst Park freezer, his string of saves very nearly got Wales all three. In added time, Bale advanced with predatory instinct and struck a fearsome shot that Asmir Begovic strained every sinew to tip wide. Then Bale whipped over the corner but Hal Robson-Kanu to get himself in a mess from two yards out. Wales forward Gareth Bale narrowly misses with this shot on goal against Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Ashley Williams had an excellent chance too in the 78th minute, arriving unmarked onto Bale’s free-kick six yards out only to head over. Hennessey provided that platform though, his best save of the night coming 10 minutes from the end. Miralem Pjanic hit his free-kick from 25 yards with dip and swerve but Hennessey threw his 6ft 6in frame into the air, reached up a glove, and diverted the ball wide. It was as thrilling as goalless draws come, and sees Wales top Group B in qualifying for Euro 2016. This was the most eagerly anticipated home international in years and it showed in the roads around Cardiff. Heavy traffic meant the stadium bore plenty of empty seats at kick-off. Eventually the projected 30,741 crowd assembled to mark the biggest since England visited the Millenium in March 2011. They had come hoping to see Wales make a statement of their intentions in this qualifying campaign; they had come wanting Bale to do the business again. In the seventh minute, he should have. Joe Ledley fed the ball to Chris Gunter on the right wing and the Reading player immediately saw Bale had somehow been granted more space in the Bosnia area than he might expect walking atop Mount Snowdon. A swift cross followed but, from inside the six-yard box, Bale fluffed his lines and missed the ball. Defender Toni Sunjic leapt to divert it for a corner. It was a promising start nevertheless. Bale had another opportunity when Ben Davies sent a high pass forward but world’s most expensive left boot only managed to send a lofted volley wide. Then Gunter volleyed over from Neil Taylor’s cross. Wales forward Gareth Bale gets in a shot at goal during the EURO 2016 qualifier. Wales forward Gareth Bale races past Bosnia's Miralem Pjanic at Cardiff City Stadium. Wales' Simon Church (centre) and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Toni Sunjic (left) battle for the ball. Gradually, though, with Everton’s Muhamed Besic doing an excellent job marking Bale, Bosnia gained increasing possession. Pjanic, so effective for Roma at Manchester City in the Champions League, was at the heart of most it. He had already seen a deflected shot from range test Hennessey before he fired an effort just wide in the 27th minute. The second period saw Hennessey come to the fore. He may be keeping the Palace bench warm but he was alert time and again as Bosnia laid siege to the Welsh goal for the first ten minutes after the interval.

Wales forward Hal Robson-Kanu has a shot at goal against Bosnia and Herzegovina. He spread himself to deny Haris Medunjanin from four yards following Tino-Sven Susic’s cross, then saved twice from Edin Dezko, the second at full-stretch as the City striker nodded a high ball into the far corner. His second save from Medunjanin, as Wales groaned under the pressure, was just as impressive. He pushed the Bosnian’s shot from range far away from the three lurking attackers. The intensity of the evening was laid bare when a mass melee broke out following James Chester’s firm, yet fair, tackle on Besic that earned him an undeserved yellow card. Ashley Williams and Dzeko were both booked by referee Vladislav Bezborodov, seemingly for the crime of being captains. The episode illustrated Welsh steel, something missing during previous campaigns. ‘We dug deep,’ said manager Chris Coleman. ‘Last time we got bullied by Bosnia (in a 2012 friendly) but we were never bullied tonight.’ Bosnia and Herzegovina's striker Edin Dzeko (R) runs with the ball during the Euro 2016 qualifier. Gareth Bale remained upbeat despite failing to find a way through the visitors' defence. Wales defender Ashley Williams (2nd left) went close with a header in the second half. Gareth Bale clashes with Edin Dzeko during a mass melee following James Chester’s firm tackle on Besic. Hal Robson-Kanu had a great chance to grab a late winner but he got into a mess and put his header well wide.

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Wales played against Bosnia and Herzegovina in a Euro 2016 qualifier match that ended in a thrilling goalless draw. Goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey's impressive performance earned him the man-of-the-match prize and helped Wales secure a point.

Based on the sentence \\"A woman with braided hair is sitting at a table full of food and gesturing.\\", is the sentence \\"A woman is about to eat pizza\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the given sentence, \\"A woman with braided hair is sitting at a table full of food and gesturing,\\" it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the truth of the sentence \\"A woman is about to eat pizza.\\" This is because there are multiple aspects of the situation that suggest ambiguity and uncertainty. First, while the initial sentence indicates that the woman is sitting at a table full of food, it does not provide specific details about the types of food present on the table. As such, it is unknown whether there is pizza on the table or not. Consequently, we cannot determine if the woman is about to eat pizza or any other specific food item on the table. Second, the sentence focuses on the woman's action of gesturing, which may or may not be related to her intentions for the food. Gesturing can encompass a broad range of hand and arm movements that may serve multiple communicative purposes, including expressing emotions, directing attention toward an object or a person, or even acting as a substitute for speech. While the woman's gesture might suggest her intention to eat, it could also be interpreted as an indication to showcase the food to others, facilitate conversation, or react to something unrelated to her meal. The vagueness of this term prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions about her actions. Additionally, the presence of food on the table does not necessarily imply that the woman will eat any of it immediately. She could be in a social setting, such as a party or a gathering, where food is readily available for guests but not everyone is necessarily eating simultaneously. Alternatively, she might have just finished eating, or she might be waiting for other people to join her before starting her meal. Without specific contextual information about the woman's situation, we cannot be sure whether she is about to eat pizza or engage in another activity related to the table full of food. Overall, due to the lack of concrete details about the food on the table and the woman's actions, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the truth of the statement \\"A woman is about to eat pizza.\\" Additional information would be required to determine the woman's intentions and the variety of food available to her before drawing any conclusions regarding her potential consumption of pizza."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Question: Compared to a balloon that has the size of a head a balloon the size of a fist will have more pressure or less pressure? Paragraph : During inhalation, because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Compared to a balloon the size of a head, a balloon the size of a fist will have more pressure. To answer this question, we must first understand the factors that impact the pressure inside a balloon. The pressure inside a balloon is influenced by the amount of air inside it and the size of the balloon itself. As the balloon expands, its internal pressure decreases. This is due to the fact that the rubber or latex walls of the balloon offer resistance to the expanding force of the air inside, and this resistance is higher when the balloon is smaller. The relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature of the gas inside the balloon can be described by the ideal gas law, which states: PV = nRT where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the amount of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. If the temperature (T) and the amount of gas (n) are kept constant, the equation simplifies to: P1V1 = P2V2 The comparison between a balloon the size of a head and a balloon the size of a fist can be better understood using the concept of elasticity. When a smaller balloon is inflated, its walls are stretched more considerably than the walls of a larger balloon when they contain the same amount of air. Consequently, the pressure exerted by the air molecules inside the walls of the smaller balloon is higher than in the larger balloon. This is due to the greater force needed to stretch the smaller balloon's walls. Now, let's relate this back to the given paragraph. Although the paragraph mentions air pressure in the context of inhalation and lungs, we can still use the concept of pressure differences based on volume. In the case of the lungs, when the chest volume is larger during inhalation, the air pressure inside is lower than outside; comparing this scenario to balloon sizes, when a balloon has a larger volume (like the size of a head), it has lower pressure inside. Thus, a smaller balloon, like the size of a fist, will have higher pressure when compared to a larger balloon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This can include actions such as controlling deforestation, better forest management, and promoting reforestation activities. Step 2: Analyze the influence on the second effect mentioned - Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere - Forests play a significant role in the carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through a process called photosynthesis. By preserving and increasing the number of trees, more carbon dioxide can be absorbed and removed from the atmosphere. - Because trees can absorb and store carbon dioxide, having more environmental protection for forests will help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, ultimately leading to a lesser effect from burning fossil fuels.

An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel. Moses institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slaves on the project, and eventually Prince Rameses, Moses's \\"brother\\", charges him with planning an insurrection, pointing out that the slaves are calling him the \\"Deliverer\\". Moses defends himself against the charges, arguing that he is simply making his workers more productive by making them stronger and happier and proves his point with the impressive progress he is making. Rameses had earlier been charged by Sethi with finding out whether there really is a Hebrew fitting the description of the Deliverer. Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. Nefretiri kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of Levite cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses goes...

Q: What determines if twins are identical? What is the correct answer to this question? Pick from: (1). their genes (2). their behavior (3). their environment (4). their personalities...A:","completion":"The correct answer to this question is (1). their genes Step 1: Analyze the given options Option 1: their genes - Identical twins share the same genetic makeup, making them identical both physically and genetically Option 2: their behavior - Behavior is influenced by genetics, environment, and individual experiences. It is not an accurate determinant for identifying identical twins Option 3: their environment - The environment plays a role in shaping an individual's behavior and experiences but does not determine whether twins are identical Option 4: their personalities - Similar to behavior, personalities are influenced by a combination of genetics, environment, and experiences, and cannot solely determine if twins are identical Step 2: Identify the determinant factor Identical twins originate from a single fertilized egg, which splits into two embryos. This results in twins sharing the same genetic material, making them identical. Step 3: Justify the choice Based on the analysis of the options and identification of the determinant factor, I conclude that the correct answer is their genes (Option 1). This is because identical twins have the same genetic makeup, making them genetically identical."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"UFC star Jon Jones banned for one year after taking 'contaminated pill used for erectile dysfunction'\\"","completion":"Title: UFC Star Jon Jones Banned for One Year After Taking 'Contaminated Pill Used for Erectile Dysfunction' Introduction In a shocking turn of events, former UFC light heavyweight champion, Jon Jones, has been handed a one-year ban from competition by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for the use of a contaminated pill associated with erectile dysfunction. This suspension stems from a sample collected in June, which provided evidence of prohibited substances. This marks Jones' second suspension due to USADA violations, leaving his fans and the MMA community questioning his career's future. The Contaminated Substance Jones tested positive for the presence of two prohibited substances, clomiphene and letrozole, which are both listed as anti-estrogen agents on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list. These substances are typically used to regulate hormone levels, and are commonly taken by athletes when they cycle off the usage of anabolic steroids in order to counter the hormonal imbalance caused by the steroids. The Banned Pill Controversy Jones' team conducted their own investigation to identify the source of the tainted substances in the athlete's system. Their findings indicated a sexual performance enhancement pill known as 'Tadalafil,' commonly described as \\"generic Cialis,\\" was responsible for the failed drug test. During a hearing conducted by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) in September, Jones' attorney, Howard Jacobs, argued that the fighter should not be held responsible for the contamination. According to Jacobs, Jones had taken the pill without being aware of its contents. It was also disclosed that the pill was given to him by a teammate, which seemed to heighten the speculation on the matter. The USADA Ruling While the NSAC offered a temporary suspension, the case was forwarded to an independent arbitration panel to reach a final decision. The USADA, on the other hand, took Jones' admission of taking the pill into account but maintained that athletes should be held accountable for everything they ingest. USADA's CEO, Travis Tygart, firmly stated that the violation of anti-doping policies was severe and warranted a significant sanction. In November, the arbitration panel ruled in favor of a one-year suspension for Jones. In their 49-page decision, the panel noted that the athlete had recklessly disregarded the banned substances and failed to do his due diligence. The panel believed that even though Jones didn't ingest the substances to enhance his athletic performance, he should be subject to the maximum possible sanction. Impact on Jon Jones' Career Jon Jones' suspension has dealt a significant blow to his UFC career and public image. The 33-year-old fighter, once considered to be among the greatest of all time, has a previous track record with USADA violations. In 2016, he faced another doping controversy connected to the use of prohibited substances, leading to a temporary suspension. This new development raises several questions about his commitment to the sport and whether he will be able to bounce back and compete at the highest level once his suspension ends. Jones will be eligible to return to the Octagon in July, but it remains to be seen if the former champion can regain his earlier form and adapt to a division that has rapidly evolved in his absence. Conclusion The case of Jon Jones serves as a cautionary tale for professional athletes, emphasizing the importance of being vigilant about the substances they introduce into their system. It also highlights the need for stricter policies and enhanced educational programs to protect both the sport and its participants. As for Jones, his one-year suspension stands as a significant setback. Only time will tell if he can overcome this obstacle and reclaim his status as one of MMA's greatest fighters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe ( MEESS; German: [mi:s]; born Maria Ludwig Michael Mies; March 27, 1886 - August 17, 1969) was a German-American architect. He is commonly referred to and was addressed as Mies, his surname. Mies designed a series of four middle-income high-rise apartment buildings for developer Herbert Greenwald: the 860-880 (which was built between 1949 and 1951) and 900-910 Lake Shore Drive towers on Chicago's Lakefront. These towers, with facades of steel and glass, were radical departures from the typical residential brick apartment buildings of the time. Mies found their unit sizes too small for him, choosing instead to continue living in a spacious traditional luxury apartment a few blocks away. The towers were simple rectangular boxes with a non-hierarchical wall enclosure, raised on stilts above a glass-enclosed lobby. The lobby is set back from the perimeter columns, which were exposed around the perimeter of the building above, creating a modern arcade not unlike those of the Greek temples. This configuration created a feeling of light, openness, and freedom of movement at the ground level that became the prototype for countless new towers designed both by Mies's office and his followers. Some historians argue that this new approach is an expression of the American spirit and the boundless open space of the frontier, which German culture so admired. Once Mies had established his basic design concept for the general form and details of his tower buildings, he applied those solutions (with evolving refinements) to his later high-rise building projects. The architecture of his towers appears to be similar, but each project represents new ideas about the formation of highly sophisticated urban space at ground level. He delighted in the composition of multiple towers arranged in a seemingly casual non-hierarchical relation to each other. Just as with his interiors, he created free flowing spaces and flat surfaces that represented the idea of an oasis of uncluttered clarity and calm within the chaos of the city. He included nature by leaving openings in the pavement, through which plants seem to grow unfettered by urbanization, just as in the pre-settlement environment. Did he receive any formal recognition?","completion":"Yes, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was a well-known architect, and his designs for the apartment buildings in Chicago were considered very modern and unique for their time. He created beautiful spaces using steel and glass, making the buildings feel light and open. Many people admired his work and followed his ideas in creating new designs. His buildings were thought to capture the spirit of freedom and openness found in American culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and advances through a series of downs until it scores or loses possession.

Question: What is the main disadvantage of using algorithms The answer is:","completion":"No, the given answer does not directly address the main disadvantage of using algorithms for a force-directed graph drawing. The main disadvantage of using force-directed algorithms in graph drawing is related to performance and scalability. As the number of nodes and edges in the graph increases, the computational complexity of the algorithm escalates exponentially. In other words, as graphs become larger and more intricate, the time taken by the algorithm to converge to an optimal solution can become exceedingly high, impacting the response time and the overall efficiency of the visualization process. This can result in sub-optimal or unresponsive layouts for applications with large datasets or real-time constraints. Additionally, force-directed algorithms might produce different layouts every time they are run, leading to inconsistent results. Other challenges in force-directed graph drawing include difficulty in preventing node overlap and edge crossing, as well as readability issues when visualizing densely connected graphs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Webb, the first referee to officiate the European Champions League final and World Cup final in the same season, dished out 13 yellow cards and one red as Spain defeated the Netherlands 1-0 in a tempestuous clash at Soccer City, Johannesburg. Dutch coach Bert Van Marwijk and several of his players suggested the English official favored the Spanish, and Netherlands fans booed Webb and his assistants when they collected their medals after the game. But ex-referee Jeff Winter, who took charge of several fiery encounters between English giants like Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, was full of praise for Webb's performance in extremely testing circumstances. \\"I thought he had a superb game,\\" Winter told CNN. \\"I find it very difficult to remember a more testing game than that at any level. I thought the players' behavior and discipline were abysmal. \\"It was as if the Dutch had decided the only way they were going to stop Spain was by kicking them, harassing the referee and being obnoxious throughout. \\"From a referee's point of view, if the players don't want to be controlled it's virtually impossible to control them. Had it had been a referee without his experience of the European game, they might have lost control within the first 30 minutes.\\" Webb's tally of 14 yellow cards -- including the red shown to Netherlands defender Johnny Heitinga in extra-time - was a record for the World Cup final. 1. Why was the referee criticized? 2. What specifically had everyone in an uproar? 3. What did he do that made everyone believe he was showing favoritism? 4. What is his name? 5. What was kind of special or unusal about his refereeing these games? 6. Did EVERYONE think he called a bad game? 7. Who stuck up for him? 8. Who is he? 9. How did he think of how the participants behaved? 10. Does he think the players desire to be instructed on what to do? Numbered answers:","completion":"1. The referee was criticized for his performance in the World Cup final, with some people saying he favored Spain over the Netherlands. 2.

In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX wants what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonX, respectively. As a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonX may also desire to hug PersonY. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Head: PersonX eats red meat<sep>Tail: to relax and let the food digest.","completion":"To arrive at the answer, I analyzed the Head and the Tail phrases to check if there is a coherent connection between the actions or outcomes mentioned in both of them. In this case: Head: PersonX eats red meat - Here, PersonX is eating red meat Tail: to relax and let the food digest - This suggests that after eating, someone would want to relax and let the food digest Now, I'll check if these two phrases are connected in such a way that as a result of the Head action, PersonX would want what is mentioned in the Tail. Since the Head is about PersonX eating red meat, it is reasonable to assume that after eating, PersonX would want to relax and let the food digest. Thus, the answer is \\"Yes\\" because there is a coherent connection between the Head and the Tail that makes it likely that PersonX wants what is mentioned in the Tail as a result of the Head."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - That bacteria begins to grow and reproduce inside the cells - The dividing bacteria begin to make toxins - Those toxins damage your cells - Disease symptoms may begin. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process leading to the disease symptoms is: Infection or colonization of host cells by pathogenic bacteria. To provide a detailed overview of the entire process, it can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Infection or colonization of host cells by pathogenic bacteria: In order for disease to develop, harmful bacteria must first gain entry into a host organism. This often occurs through natural openings such as the mouth, nose, or genitourinary tract, or through breaks in the skin caused by injury or insect bites. Once inside the host, pathogenic bacteria begin to attach themselves to specific cells or tissues, which is an essential step in establishing a foothold within the host organism. This attachment is facilitated by specialized proteins or structures on the surface of bacteria known as adhesins, which recognize and bind to complementary receptor molecules on the surface of host cells. 2. Bacteria begins to grow and reproduce inside the cells: After infection and colonization, the bacteria start to multiply. Some bacteria can do this within the host cell itself, while others grow and reproduce in the extracellular spaces between cells. They often utilize nutrients from the host, which allows them to continue growing while evading the host's immune system. This unchecked growth and reproduction lead to an increase in the number of bacterial cells within the host organism. 3. The dividing bacteria begin to make toxins: Many pathogenic bacteria produce toxic substances called exotoxins or endotoxins, which can damage host cells and tissues. Exotoxins are proteins that are secreted by the bacteria, whereas endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides that form part of the bacterial cell wall and are released when the bacteria die and the cell wall structure disintegrates. These toxins can have a wide range of deleterious effects, including interfering with normal cell function, damaging cell membranes, and disrupting the host's immune system. 4. Those toxins damage your cells: The toxins produced by bacteria cause damage to host cells in various ways, such as disrupting cellular processes, inducing cell death, or triggering an inflammatory response. The damage to cells can sometimes result in tissue injury, organ dysfunction, or even systemic effects on the host organism. This tissue damage can also lead to the release of more toxins, further exacerbating the damage and inflammation. 5. Disease symptoms may begin: As the pathogenic bacteria continue to grow, reproduce, and produce toxins, the resulting cellular and tissue damage contributes to the development of disease symptoms. These symptoms may be localized, affecting only the specific area of bacterial infection, or systemic, affecting the entire host organism. Symptoms can vary widely depending on the type of bacteria and the host's immune response, and may include fever, pain, swelling, redness, pus formation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and more. In summary, the missing first step of the process is the infection or colonization of host cells by pathogenic bacteria, which is followed by bacterial growth and reproduction, toxin production, cellular damage, and finally, the onset of disease symptoms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Will being sick with a bacterial infection cause a person's body temperature to increase or decrease? James is sick with strep throat, a bacterial infection. After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F. Hint: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. A:","completion":"Being sick with a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, will cause a person's body temperature to increase. This increase in body temperature is known as a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature, with normal human body temperature being 98.6°F (37°C). The reason behind the increase in body temperature is that most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this normal temperature. By raising the body temperature, the pathogens cannot reproduce as quickly, and this helps in slowing down their activity. The paragraph also mentions that the immune system responds to the infection, and white blood cells make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever not only impedes the pathogen's reproduction but also stimulates the immune system to produce more white blood cells. These white blood cells play a critical role in the body's defense mechanism against infections. In the given scenario, James is sick with strep throat, a bacterial infection, and his brother records a temperature of 100.6°F. This elevated body temperature is an indication of a fever, which is the body's natural response to fight the bacterial infection. The higher body temperature slows down the reproduction of the bacteria causing strep throat and boosts the production of white blood cells, which further assists in combating the infection. Therefore, being sick with a bacterial infection like strep throat will cause a person's body temperature to increase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\".

It suggests that the kids' decision-making process is much more complex than previously believed. \\"They take into account group information, ranging from cliques and networks, when deciding what makes a group work well. Sometimes kids are excluded because they lack social skills, but a lot of time it has nothing to do with that. Instead it has to do with what we refer to as 'group membership' such as gender, race, nation, and culture,\\" says Professor Melanie Killen, the Associate Director of the Centre for Children Relationships and Culture at Maryland, who led the 4-year project. Reporting their findings in the journal, the researcher said whatever was the reason, individuals who experienced long-term exclusion from the group of friends suffered from depression, anxiety and loneliness. The study looked at two models to define how children make decisions regarding acceptance of other kids in their group -- the individual social _ model and the inter-group social cognition model. While the former says that children's rejection occurs due to social deficits like shyness, wariness or fearfulness, the latter says that it happens because of group dynamics, prejudice and exclusion. It was also found that the age of children was also a factor that influenced their decisions regarding other kids' acceptance as friends. \\"With age, kids become more aware of group dynamics, conventions, customs, and rituals. With this comes a greater concern about group functioning, which can lead to exclusion which can be negative from a social justice viewpoint,\\" says Killen. The researcher believes that her study may have many benefits, as it could provide insights into how to help when children are rejected by their peers. While making friends, kids think more about the following EXCEPT _ . A) social skills B) culture C) race D) gender Answer:","completion":"A) social skills"},{"prompt":"Given the question: Context: Jordan murdered several people and was going to spend his life in prison.

Q: As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others. According to the above context, answer the following question. Who was raped? A:","completion":"The mother, who is writing the memoir and speaking publicly about her experiences, was raped at the age of 15 and molested by a teacher from the age of 15 to 16.

Foil your opponent. In this picture, the figures are foiled against the background. Does the word \\"foil\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"foil\\" does not mean the same thing in the two sentences you provided. \\"Foil\\" can be used in a few different contexts with varying meanings. In these particular sentences, we come across two different meanings of the word. In the first sentence - \\"Foil your opponent\\" - the meaning of \\"foil\\" is to prevent an opponent from achieving their goal, or to thwart their plans. To foil someone's plans or actions means to stop, hinder, or frustrate them from succeeding so it typically implies that there is a competing agenda or a sense of rivalry between the individuals involved. This usage is often applied in sports, games, and situations where competition is a significant factor. In the second sentence - \\"In this picture, the figures are foiled against the background\\" - the meaning of \\"foil\\" is quite different. This usage refers to a visual contrast or a background that helps emphasize or enhance the appearance of the primary subject(s) or objects. In the context of visual arts, literature, or storytelling, a foil is a character, object, or setting that contrasts with another character, object, or setting, highlighting particular qualities or features of the primary entity. This kind of foil often helps in creating a more engaging and dynamic composition, making it easier for the audience to understand and appreciate the main focus.

Article: Scientists in Israel have discovered a new way to test for water pollution by \\"listening\\" to what the plants growing in water have to say. By shining a laser beam on the tiny pieces of _ floating in the water,the researchers said they hear sound waves that tell them the type and amount of contamination in the water. \\"It is a red light,telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water,\\" said Zvy Dubinsky,an aquatic biologist at Israel's Bar Ilan University.\\"Algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality.\\"\\"The secret,\\" he said,\\"is to measure the rate of photosynthesis in the algae,meaning the plant's ability to transform light into energy.\\" During photosynthesis,plants also release oxygen into the air. Dubinsky's technique is easy to perform because of the overabundance of algae in the planet's water.Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from algae.A prototype tester that occupies about one square meter of a laboratory desktop,shoots a laser beam at water samples to stimulate photosynthesis in the algae.But not all of the laser's heat is used.Depending on the condition of the algae and the rate of photosynthesis,some of the heat is shot back into the water,creating sound waves,Dubinsky said.With a special underwater microphone,researchers are able to analyze the strength of the sound waves and determine the health of the algae and the condition of the surrounding water. \\"Algae suffering from lead poisoning,like waste discharged from battery and paint manufacturing plants,will produce a different sound than those suffering from lack of iron or exposure to other toxins,\\" said researcher Yulia Pinchasov.She said that testing algae photosynthesis can determine water quality more accurately and easily than laborintensive methods now used like chemical and radioactive carbon testing. Question: We can infer from the passage that _ . - algae can produce a loud sound when polluted - algae can die easily from pollution - photosynthesis of the algae can only be caused by sunlight - photosynthesis of the algae is related to water quality The answer to this question is:","completion":"photosynthesis of the algae is related to water quality"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy.

Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization.

Movie plot title: Udayananu Tharam Movie plot: Udayananu Tharam is the story of Udayabhanu (Mohanlal), a worshipper of films and an immensely talented assistant film director, who yearns to write and direct his own movie at a time when the industry is filled with dubious filmmakers. Rajappan Thengummoodu (Sreenivasan) is a rather crooked friend of Udayabhanu and an aspiring and failed actor. As Udayabhanu finally prepares to shoot his first movie based on his own script, he discovers to his horror that Rajappan has stolen his manuscript, and shooting is underway with Rajappan playing the lead, which eventually propels him to stardom. Udhayabhanu soon finds himself faced with a career and personal crisis, with his faltering relations with his superstar wife Madhumati (Meena Durairaj) contributing to the latter. Later, with the help of producer Babykuttan (Mukesh), Udayabanu prepares to direct another film, but he is forced to cast Rajappan as the hero since he was the star with most screen value at that time. Rajappan takes up the offer, since he is also at a plateau of his career, but refuses to co-operate and throws tantrums and causes maximum trouble when possible. He spends most of his time actively flirting with the actresses in the film. Towards the end of the shoot - using a perceived insult as a ruse, Rajappan leaves the set leaving the movie unfinished with the hope that this will destroy Udayabanu's career for ever. But Udayabanu devises clever tactics and shoots the remaining scenes with Rajappan without him even being aware of it. At the end - the film is a critical and box office success, but Rajappan realises his mistakes and admits publicly that Udayabanu is the real star and not himself.

Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who volunteered to tend to army horses? ? Sir Edwin Lutyens was among the most distinguished architects for war memorials in Britain. He became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the Imperial War Graves Commission and his design for the Cenotaph on London's Whitehall. As well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across Britain, Lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients. Many were heirs to the country houses Lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in Mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century. His work in Mells arose through his friend and collaborator Gertrude Jekyll, who introduced him to the Horners through a family connection. Lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village. In addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to Raymond Asquith (Edward's brother-in-law), also located in St Andrew's Church, and the village war memorial. Lutyens designed two other memorials to Horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in St Andrew's Church; and a stone tablet in Cambrai Cathedral.Alfred Munnings was a painter specialising in horses. He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye. He volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian war artist attached to Canadian cavalry. In 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the Jockey Club for a sculpture of the racehorse Brown Jack at Epsom Downs Racecourse....

Zweitens, Herr Präsident, wie lange werden wir mit einem UN-Sicherheitsrat leben, in dem für die Sieger des Zweiten Weltkriegs ein anachronistisches Vetorecht existiert, das in der Charta von San Francisco von 1945 festgeschrieben ist? Translate to English English:","completion":"Secondly, Mr. President, how long will we live with a UN Security Council in which an anachronistic veto power exists for the winners of World War II, as enshrined in the Charter of San Francisco in 1945? This question raises concerns about the current structure and decision-making process within the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), specifically regarding the anachronistic veto power for the five permanent members (P5), which are the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom. These powers, granted to the P5 after their victory in World War II, are enshrined in the Charter of San Francisco, also known as the Charter of the United Nations. It is important to recognize that the world has changed significantly since the formation of the United Nations in 1945. The global political landscape has shifted, with emerging powers now playing essential roles in addressing global challenges. However, the composition of the Security Council, particularly the P5’s veto power, has remained virtually unchanged since its inception. This veto power allows any one of the P5 members to block UNSC resolutions, even if the rest of the council overwhelmingly supports it. The veto power has been widely criticized for being undemocratic, perpetuating power imbalances, and contributing to gridlock in the face of urgent international crises. Addressing the question of how long we will continue to live with this anachronistic veto power for the winners of World War II, it is noteworthy that there have been numerous calls for reform over the years. The demand for a more inclusive, democratized, and responsive UN Security Council has gained traction in recent times, with proposals focusing on the expansion of both permanent and non-permanent membership, as well as the possible revision or elimination of the veto power for select issues. However, it remains uncertain how long these discussions and reform efforts will go on before tangible changes take shape. The process of amending the UN Charter and altering the composition of the Security Council is complex and requires broad consensus among member states, including the support of the P5 themselves. Given the strategic advantages conferred by their veto power, the P5 can be expected to be cautious about any changes that may dilute their influence within the Security Council. In conclusion, the question of how long we will live with the anachronistic veto power for the winners of World War II is challenging to answer definitively. The demand for reform is growing, but the political complexities surrounding the issue make it difficult to predict how long it will take for meaningful change to occur. Despite these challenges, the continuing discourse on the matter reflects an increasing global awareness of the need for a more equitable, democratic, and responsive UN Security Council that better represents the 21st-century world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He had always been passionate about opening a bookstore, and he knew that his hometown, a quaint and historic village, was the perfect place for it. The old brick building at the corner of Main Street and Oak Lane, with its tall, arched windows and worn wooden door, was just waiting to be filled with books and stories from all over the world. Derrick knew he needed William's help to jumpstart his dream, and William, being a successful entrepreneur himself, agreed to lend Derrick the money. It was a leap of faith, as the two of them had been friends since childhood and neither wanted to jeopardize their friendship over a business venture. But William believed in Derrick's determination and sincerity, and so the seed money was given. Derrick immediately set to work, renovating and cleaning the old building that was to become the home of \\"Bibliophile's Haven.\\" He replaced the creaky floorboards, painted the walls a warm, welcoming shade of off-white, and installed shelves upon shelves of old-fashioned wooden bookcases. Work went on late into the night, as Derrick was spurred on by his passion and dream of seeing his bookstore come to life. As the weeks went by, the neighborhood started to take notice of the changes going on in the old, once-forgotten building. Those who passed by couldn't help but steal glances at the unique, vintage-themed bookstore under construction. Derrick had even managed to find a beautiful wrought-iron spiral staircase, which he placed right in the center of the shop to create an enchanting ambiance. He meticulously sourced vintage-style lamps and posters to adorn the walls, creating a cozy atmosphere that paid homage to the literary past. Rumors quickly spread about the arrival of the new bookstore, and there was a palpable sense of excitement in the air. The village had been without a proper bookstore for many years, and the prospect of having one fueled the anticipation of local reading enthusiasts. Betty, an elderly lady who lived next door, was one of the first to approach Derrick, offering her help and an extensive book collection she had amassed over her lifetime. She willingly donated her beloved books to the store, and Derrick was grateful to see his shelves begin to fill with titles from every genre imaginable. In return, Betty became a regular at Bibliophile's Haven, often assisting Derrick in organizing and recommending books to customers. As the finishing touches were made, Derrick finally felt that his labor of love was ready to be shared with the world. He decided to hold a grand opening celebration to officially introduce Bibliophile's Haven to the community. Invitations were sent out, and soon enough, the excitement reached fever pitch. On the day of the opening, Derrick felt both nervous and excited, but he knew all his hard work would finally pay off. As he unlocked the door and flipped the \\"Closed\\" sign to \\"Open,\\" he felt a surge of adrenaline. The bell above the door chimed as the first customers entered, and Derrick's fears began to fade. He spent the day welcoming visitors, showing them around the beautiful space he had created and sharing his love for books with his fellow bookworms. As the sun dipped low beyond the horizon, the evening celebrations began. People from far and wide had come to toast the new bookstore, and its now crowded interiors buzzed with laughter, excited conversations, and the clinking of glasses in celebration. Over the weeks and months that followed, Bibliophile's Haven became a fixture in the community. Patrons of all ages browsed, read, and shared their love of literature within its enchanting walls. Derrick watched with pride as friendships blossomed, book clubs convened, and the hearts and minds of both young and old were opened to the boundless worlds held within the pages of his books. One afternoon, as he paused to take in the delightful scene before him, Derrick's heart swelled with gratitude for the man who had made it all possible: William. By believing in Derrick's vision and supporting his dream, William had unintentionally breathed new life not only into the old brick building but also into the vibrant community that surrounded it. And so, Derrick decided to honor his dear friend in a most fitting way: by dedicating a special section of the bookstore to him. The \\"William's Corner\\" would feature a comfy armchair, a table filled with William's favorite titles, and an inscription that read: \\"To the man who made dreams come true - thank you.\\" As the years went by, Bibliophile's Haven continued to be a magical place for book lovers, a testament to friendship, determination, and the power of turning dreams into reality. And as Derrick looked back at the journey that led him to where he was, he knew that he had penned the most incredible story of all."},{"prompt":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - The shaft of the turbine spins - Shaft is connected to a generator - The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor - The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops inside - The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity - A:","completion":"Capture and convert energy source (e.g., water, steam, wind, or gas) to spin the turbine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to learn about a super cool building that can touch the sky and has almost no shadow. Can you imagine that? It's called a skyscraper. Imagine playing outside on a sunny day, you are hot and looking for some shade to cool off, right? But sometimes, tall buildings make big shadows that block out sunlight from parks, streets, and other fun places. Well, some smart people called architects, who design buildings, have come up with a fun idea! They want to build a skyscraper that doesn't make a shadow. Now, how can a big building like that not make a shadow? You are probably wondering. Well, the secret is in its special shape. These architects are like magicians with their pencils and drawings. They made the building look like a tall, twisted tower. It's so fascinating! It's like making a tower from your play dough and stretch it while twisting it. This magical twisty tower has glass windows all over it. So when Mr. Sun shines his bright light on the building, the glass helps to bounce the sunlight around. It's like playing with mirrors on a sunny day, and seeing how the light reflects. This means the sunlight reaches the ground below and doesn't cause a big shadow. It's almost like the building is playing hide-and-seek with its own shadow! Because the sunlight can reach the ground, people can still enjoy the warm sun, even when standing close to this huge skyscraper. How cool is that? The parks, streets, and other fun places will be full of sunlight and happiness! These architects are super creative and are always looking for ways to make our cities beautiful, fun, and sunny for everyone. Who knows what kind of amazing buildings they will think of next? Maybe, someday, you can grow up to be a fantastic architect too and create buildings that touch the sky without casting shadows.

The boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite. The famous tirade of Lucretius, the Epicurean rationalist, against what is usually translated as \\"superstition\\" was in fact aimed at excessive religio. Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith, but superstitio was viewed as an \\"inappropriate desire for knowledge\\"; in effect, an abuse of religio. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Doing what type of actions were considered to be wrong in Rome?","completion":"In ancient Rome, actions that were considered to be wrong were those categorized as falling under \\"superstitio.\\" These actions generally involved excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance, where individuals participated in rituals or held beliefs deemed excessive or unnecessary. Such actions could be understood as an abuse of \\"religio,\\" which was a proper, knowledge-based observance and practice of Roman religion. Women and foreigners were believed to be particularly prone to engaging in superstitio, as they were thought to possess an inappropriate desire for knowledge. While religio itself was a legitimate aspect of Roman society, the excessive and uncontrolled aspects of superstitio were considered wrong and undesirable. In the context of Lucretius' tirade, the Epicurean rationalist targeted superstitio in the sense of excessive religio, arguing against adhering to the belief or practice of rituals and customs that were unnecessarily strict or extreme.

If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies. Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue. Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, gore & belly laughs. It is a different beast altogether (forgive the pun). Fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants. At first I thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la Matinée, but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia. Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school. His mom is would-be social climber,and his dad is nervy and detached. Seeking to keep up with the Joneses, mom (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is disinterested at first, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon proves a great buddy for Jimmy. Until his collar goes on the blink... Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it IS. Much of the humour is of the light family variety, and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog/family moments. Yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark, truly funny moments, which while welcome, will ensure an R rating for what is, for extended periods, a family comedy. The film looks gorgeous, and is wonderfully performed by all involved. Despite its difficult tonal problems, I hope this movie finds a niche, as it's quite a little gem in this year's deluge of cinematic crap. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Article: Why can't some people even get an inch of what they dream of becoming? Blame it on pure dreaming and lack of surrounding goals for achieving their dreams. Setting goals is very significant part of accomplishing and positive actions. It is like scaling a 200 feet construction and marking in the early hours on what feet you would like to reach at this specific period. People who set goals literally generate a map of their goal settings in life, marking where they should start, where to pause, where to study a bit, and where and when to end. Once this map comes into being, it allows the map drawer to check where he is in the scheme of things and whether or not he is making some planning that will take him closer to his goals. By surrounding goals, people will know how they are doing and what they should be doing to get their goals or dreams in life. They will know if they can relax or if they have to double their efforts when they are falling short of what is expected of them. Goal surroundings means a person is prepared in dealing with challenges that may affect his plans. Being proactive means one is able to outline possible difficulties that may occur as well as the solutions to these difficulties. By doing this, a person is not easily scared or defeated when challenges occur because he has already prepared for them. He knows they can happen and he has prepared a solution or strategy when that time comes. Setting goals will enable people to track their progress in whatever hard work they set out to do. It will help people become more confident in themselves and more motivated to get their plans. Question: The purpose of this passage is to _ .

Hint: Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist.

Question 2: How do graphic calculators, such as the TI-84, calculate numerical integrals and derivatives of functions? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: To calculate the product of 44.84 times 9.84, follow these steps: 1. Start by multiplying 44.84 by 9.84: 44.84 * 9.84 = 441.6656 2. Round the result to the appropriate decimal places, if necessary. In this case, I'll keep four decimal places: 441.6656 ≈ 441.6656 So, the answer to question 1 is: 44.84 times 9.84 is approximately 441.6656. Question 2: Graphing calculators like the TI-84 often calculate numerical integrals and derivatives of functions using numerical methods. 1. Calculating Numerical Derivatives: One common method is the finite difference method. It involves taking two nearby points, and the derivative is approximated as the slope between these two points. As the points get closer, the approximation gets more accurate. 2. Calculating Numerical Integrals: A common method for calculating numerical integrals is the trapezoidal rule. It involves breaking the area under the curve of the function into several trapezoids. By summing the areas of these trapezoids, the calculator approximates the definite integral. So, the answer to question 2 is: Graphing calculators, like the TI-84, calculate numerical integrals and derivatives of functions using numerical methods, such as the finite difference method for derivatives and the trapezoidal rule for integrals. Comparison: No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking for a simple multiplication calculation, while question 2 is asking about how a specific type of calculator calculates numerical integrals and derivatives of functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement essentially describes a progression of the speaker's outdoor experiences, particularly how they evolved from spending time by the river to eventually staying overnight in tents. Initially, the speaker mentions spending time out by the side of the river, presumably engaging in various outdoor activities such as picnicking, swimming, fishing, or just relaxing. This phase of their river experiences seems to have been characterized by not spending the night at the location, or possibly staying overnight without a tent, possibly sleeping outdoors or in a hammock. Later on, the speaker states that they started using a tent, leading to tent camping experiences. The use of the word \\"we\\" implies that the speaker was part of a group or at least with someone else in these camping endeavors. This shift in their outdoor activities likely involved a more extended stay at the river, sleeping overnight inside a tent for protection from the elements, insects, and possibly wildlife. The act of tent camping generally involves setting up a temporary shelter in the form of a tent at a campsite. The tent serves as a sleeping and resting area, providing protection from weather, insects, and other potential disturbances. Alongside the tent, campers will typically have additional equipment and supplies such as sleeping bags, camping stoves, and food items necessary for a comfortable stay. Tent camping also provides various opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts to participate in recreational activities like hiking, fishing, canoeing, bird watching, and more - often allowing them to explore different aspects of the natural environment away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. By engaging in tent camping, individuals can enjoy the benefits of being close to nature while still maintaining some level of comfort and basic amenities. In conclusion, it cannot be said that the speaker has \\"never gone tent camping,\\" but rather that they have experienced it, as evidenced by their description of progressing from spending time by the river to using tents for overnight stays. This progression reflects an enhanced appreciation and engagement with the outdoors, and tent camping appears to be an integral part of their experiences by the river."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: who did dolly parton wrote i will always love you for? A:","completion":"A: Dolly Parton wrote the song \\"I Will Always Love You\\" for her professional partner and mentor, Porter Wagoner. The song was an expression of her feelings when she decided to leave the Porter Wagoner Show and go solo in 1973. In order to understand the background of the song, it's important to know the story of Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner's relationship. Porter Wagoner, a well-known country singer and television host, discovered Dolly Parton in 1967 and invited her to join his syndicated television show, The Porter Wagoner Show. This opportunity marked a turning point in Dolly's career, as it allowed her to showcase her singing and songwriting talents to a broader audience. Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner formed an incredibly successful duo during their time together. They recorded many hit singles, released several studio albums, and won numerous awards for their performances. Over time, however, Dolly began to yearn for a solo career and felt that she had outgrown their partnership. The decision to go solo was not an easy one for Dolly, as she had deep respect and admiration for Porter. She knew that leaving the show would disappoint him, and she wanted to convey her gratitude for all he had done for her while also expressing her desire to pursue her own path. As a result, she composed \\"I Will Always Love You\\" as a heartfelt goodbye and an assurance that she would never forget the foundation Porter had provided for her career. The song went on to become a massive hit, reaching the number one spot on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice: first in 1974 and then again in 1982 when it was re-recorded for the soundtrack of the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Moreover, the song gained even greater recognition in 1992 when it was famously covered by Whitney Houston for the movie The Bodyguard. Houston's rendition propelled \\"I Will Always Love You\\" to international success, earning Dolly Parton millions in royalties and solidifying the song's place in the annals of music history. In summary, Dolly Parton wrote \\"I Will Always Love You\\" for her mentor and professional partner, Porter Wagoner, as a poignant farewell when she decided to pursue a solo career in 1973. The song remains a testament to their close relationship and the mutual admiration they shared throughout their time together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is clear that the individual is feeling incredibly unwell, which has led to these extreme emotions and their desire to communicate their suffering to others. Firstly, the individual's health condition is evidently serious, as they use multiple letters and elongated words like \\"rrreeeeaaaaallllyyyyy\\" and \\"soooo\\" to emphasize and stress the intensity of their illness. This choice of wording is strategic to elicit the reader's empathy and to convey the severity of their sickness. In describing their state, they use the strong word \\"shit\\" to express how physically and emotionally terrible they feel. This term adds a negative and unpleasant connotation to their suffering, giving the reader a glimpse of their turmoil. Furthermore, the tweet also includes a plea for a metaphorical end to their suffering: \\"somebody please just kill me yeah.\\" It highlights an extreme level of despair that comes from feeling so sick, and they may feel as though they can't endure it any longer. This is not necessarily a direct request for self-harm but rather an exaggerated expression of the desire for relief from their current condition. It is a way of showcasing just how intense their pain is. In summary, this tweet embodies a complex sentiment of frustration, despair, and a cry for help or sympathy.

Question: Did Mill kill the wrong man or the right man? Movie plot title: The Player Movie plot: Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a Hollywood studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow (Cynthia Stevenson). He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley (Richard E.

Kiraly grew up in Santa Barbara, California. He began playing volleyball at age six with encouragement from his father, Dr. Laszlo Kiraly, who had been a member of the Hungarian Junior National team prior to fleeing the country during the Hungarian national uprising of 1956. At age 11, Kiraly entered his first beach volleyball tournament paired with his father. Kiraly attended Santa Barbara High School, where he was a member of the boys' varsity volleyball team. Kiraly joined the national team in 1981. Playing outside hitter, he proved to be an extremely solid passer. Along with teammate Aldis Berzins, Kiraly was the foundation for the \\"two-man\\" serve reception system Doug Beal created in 1983. Along with covering half the court on serve receive and consistently delivering the ball to team setter Dusty Dvorak, Kiraly proved to be an excellent defender and a highly productive outside hitter. Kiraly led U.S National Team to the gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics, overcoming a pool play loss to Brazil to defeat Brazil in the finals. Kiraly was the youngest player on the gold medal team. The 1984 Olympics were marred by the boycott of the Soviet and eastern bloc teams. The US National team showed their place as the world's best team by winning the 1985 FIVB World Cup, followed by the 1986 FIVB World Championship. In the 1988 Summer Olympics the team won its second Olympic gold medal, this time defeating the USSR in the championship match. Kiraly was selected as a captain for the 1988 team at Seoul. FIVB named Kiraly the top player in the world in 1986 and 1988. Following the 1988 Olympics, Kiraly retired from the national team. He and teammate Steve Timmons played professional volleyball for Il Messaggero Ravenna in Italy from 1990 to 1992. The team included Italians Fabio Vullo and Andrea Gardini, Roberto Masciarelli and Stefano Margutti as team members. In two seasons the team won a series of titles, including the Italian Volleyball League (1991), the Italian Cup (1991), FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship (1991), CEV Champions League (1992), and the European Supercup (1992).

Coming off their shutout home win over the Rams, the Seahawks flew to Candlestick Park for a Week 2 NFC West showdown with the San Francisco 49ers. Seattle would trail early in the first quarter as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back Frank Gore getting a 79-yard touchdown run. The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker Olindo Mare made a 36-yard field goal. San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked to bounced back from the deficit, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones. In the third quarter, the Seahawks deficit quickly increased as on the 49ers' first offensive play of the second half, Gore would explode for an 80-yard touchdown run. San Francisco would close the game out in the fourth quarter as Nedney nailed a 39-yard field goal.

Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group. In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy. Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups.

There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Anna continue answering the door? Options: A. not enough information B.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. and the situation: Two friends were involved in a car crash. they both survived, but Mike had a serious brain injury.

Question: Where do you get certain traits? Context: A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews.

Write some highlights for the following article: Former teen idol David Cassidy was ordered to serve a year of probation and had his license suspended for six months after pleading no contest Wednesday to a DUI charge in Florida. Among the other terms of the plea, the former star of the TV series \\"The Partridge Family\\" must attend DUI school, pay a 500 fine and serve 50 hours of community service, said Gayle Braun, supervisor of the misdemeanor and juvenile divisions of the state attorney's office for the judicial circuit encompassing St. Lucie County. The sentence was the minimum mandatory sentence for all first-time DUI offenders who plead no contest. The attorney for the 60-year-old actor and musician entered the plea for his client, who was not present in court. A Florida Highway Patrol officer stopped him in Fort Pierce last November after his Mercedes left the roadway and went onto the shoulder rumble strip two times before cutting off another car at an exit ramp, the police report said. Cassidy failed roadside sobriety tests and registered at 0.14% blood alcohol content on a breath test, nearly twice the state's 0.08% legal limit, according to the arrest report. The singer-actor \\"appeared to be somewhat confused\\" and was \\"very apologetic for having to be stopped,\\" the arresting officer said. Police found a half-empty bottle of bourbon under the seat of Cassidy's Mercedes, although he told the officer he had consumed only one glass of wine with lunch several hours earlier, the report said. He also told the officer he had taken a hydrocodone pill -- a pain medication also known as Vicodin -- about three hours earlier. On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was Cassidy's real-life step-mother). The family -- all of them musicians -- traveled to gigs in a repainted school bus. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teen-aged girls attracted to such hits as \\"I Think I Love You.\\" His most recent acting job was on the 2009 ABC Family sitcom \\"Ruby & the Rockits,\\" in which Cassidy played an aging former teen heartthrob. The show was canceled after one season.

In the mid-19th Century, Victorian Britain was at the peak of a rail-building bonanza, fuelled by competing private companies. Midland Rail, which had a large network centred around Derby, wanted a direct line from London to the industrial north west and it wasn't going to let hills get in its way. It smashed its way through, carving deep cuts and building six tunnels under tonnes of limestone, eventually opening its route from Bakewell to Buxton in 1863. One of the tunnels was constructed so the railway did not spoil the Duke of Rutland's view from Haddon Hall. The route was later connected to Manchester after a deal was struck with a rival firm, which had a line from Buxton in the opposite direction. For 100 years, trains carried passengers to the towns and villages of White Peak, while freight was taken to and from the factories and mills. Like many modern industrial developments, the route - which includes the picturesque Headstone Viaduct, at Monsal Head - was not always considered a good thing. At the time, critic and writer John Ruskin said: \\"The valley is gone - and now every fool in Buxton can be in Bakewell in half an hour and every fool at Bakewell in Buxton.\\" Now, it attracts thousands of visitors a year to walk, cycle or just enjoy the view of the Victorian structures. It was purchased by the national park, along with three others, after the route was closed as part of the swingeing cuts to the railways in the 1960s. The authority converted it into a path suitable for walkers, wheelchair users and cyclists but for many years four impressive tunnels remained sealed off, opened only for the occasional guided tour. In 2011, after two years of work and a grant of Â£2.5m, they were reopened and the whole route is now accessible. There are still dim hopes the line will be reopened to rail, but a study in 2004 concluded the estimated Â£100m cost of the project was too high. To help towards the cost of all 34 miles of trails - including former rail lines Tissington, High Peak and Thornhill - the Peak District National Park Authority is holding its first major fundraising campaign, with a family walk on 20 August.

Movie title: Shooter Movie plot: Bob Lee Swagger reluctantly leaves a self-imposed exile from his isolated mountain home in the Wind River Range at the request of Colonel Isaac Johnson, who appeals to him to help track down an assassin who is planning to shoot the president. Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit and Swagger assesses a site in Philadelphia as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper. However, he meets a rookie FBI special agent, Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car. After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late spotter and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa.

Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review, but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed.

It is widely believed that in some cases-such as athletes, people who live in hot, dry environments, and those with certain medical conditions-drinking a lot of water indeed helps, but no studies have been done to prove the benefits of this practice in average, healthy people, the website medheadlines.com reports. The study at the University of Pennsylvania also examined reports that some people experienced increased headaches when their consumption of water was low. In one small study, which the doctors reviewed, the group drinking the most water reported fewer headaches than the control group, \\"but the difference in the number of headaches was o small between the two groups as to be considered unimportant.\\" The researchers concluded that there is no scientific proof to support that average, healthy people need to drink at least 8 glasses of water each each day. The website medheadines.com says that, according to an Indian doctor, drinking too much water is harmful. If water enters the body more quickly than it can be removed, problems can occur.

Review: This is a new musical world for me! Prior to Asawa and Daniles, I could not appreciate this voice style at all. The Met's recent \\"megahit\\", Handel's \\"Giuilo Cesare\\" was an eye opener for me this past season. To me Daniel's voice is smooth, rich, agile and sensitively used. I can give no other praise and appreciative words than to say he makes Handel's music accessible to me. Now I know what the fuss is about. I own the recording and I am not a devotee of Baroque music. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"The product review conveys a positive sentiment. The reviewer begins by expressing that the music is a new and enjoyable experience for them, which is a particularly positive statement as they were not able to appreciate this voice style before. The mention of the Met's \\"Giuilo Cesare\\" as an eye-opener further emphasizes the reviewer's newfound appreciation for this type of music. The reviewer goes on to describe Daniel's voice as \\"smooth, rich, agile and sensitively used,\\" which are all positive attributes. They also state that he makes Handel's music accessible, which is again a compliment to Daniel's talent and ability to engage the listener. Finally, the fact that the reviewer owns the recording even though they are not a fan of Baroque music demonstrates their overall positive sentiment towards this specific performance. In conclusion, the product review is undoubtedly positive. The reviewer not only expresses their newfound appreciation for the countertenor voice style but also specifically praises Daniel's skills and the way he performs Handel's music. This positivity is further supported by their choice to own the recording despite not being a lover of Baroque music in general."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: how about how about i guess we could talk about TV movies i mean i don't know that they're really really truly movies i mean Hypothesis: How about we converse about TV movies? Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise provided is essentially an informal suggestion to discuss TV movies. Although it is presented in an uncertain and casual manner, the core idea is to have a conversation on TV movies. The hypothesis, \\"How about we converse about TV movies?\\", rephrases this idea as a clear question and captures the main topic the premise intended to discuss. The hypothesis is a concise, straightforward, and understandable version of what the premise wanted to convey. By asking this question, you can easily initiate a discussion about TV movies in a more structured and coherent manner. Now, let's talk more about TV movies and why there may be some debate over whether they are \\"truly movies.\\" TV movies, also known as television films or made-for-TV movies, are film productions specifically created for television broadcast. These movies usually have lower budgets and production values compared to theatrical releases. They are produced and distributed by television networks or cable channels instead of traditional film studios. While they are considered movies, TV movies don't go through the same processes as mainstream cinema productions. There are several reasons why people may question whether TV movies are \\"truly movies\\": 1. Production Quality: As previously mentioned, TV movies typically have lower budgets and production values than films released in theaters. This can lead to overall lower quality, including issues such as limited special effects, less experienced directors and crews, and lower-quality visuals. The production of TV movies can happen on a shorter timeline and may involve less elaborate sets and costumes compared to mainstream films. This difference in production quality can cause some people to view TV movies as subordinate to theatrical films. 2. Distribution and Screening: TV movies are made specifically for television broadcast, either on broadcast networks or cable channels. They are not released in theaters and are often directly associated with a specific television network. This contrasts with the traditional model of movies being released in theaters and later distributed via home entertainment channels (like streaming, DVD, and Blu-ray). Some people may consider this difference in distribution, and the absence of a theatrical release, to make TV movies less representative of the broader movie industry. 3. Storytelling and Content: TV movies may have a narrower range of subjects and themes, as they are often made to cater to a specific network's audience or demographics. This can result in storylines that may not be as daring or inventive compared to theatrical movies, which can explore a wide variety of stories and genres. Additionally, in some cases, TV movies may be adaptations of popular television shows, further removing them from the realm of traditional films. 4. Recognition and Response: TV movies usually have less publicity and promotion than mainstream films, which can impact their visibility and audience reach. This can result in fewer critics reviewing or discussing these movies, leading to a lesser effect on the larger cultural conversation surrounding films. Furthermore, TV movies compete for awards in distinct categories at award ceremonies, which separates them from traditional films. For example, at the Emmy Awards, TV movies have their own categories. In conclusion, while TV movies share some essential characteristics of mainstream films and contribute to the broader landscape of film storytelling, they differ in several ways that may cause some people to question their status as \\"truly movies.\\" These differences include production quality, distribution, storytelling content, and overall recognition and response. However, it is important to note that TV movies still offer entertainment and can provide unique stories and experiences that mainstream films may not always deliver."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This House would use positive discrimination to increase diversity in university What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"In the debate surrounding the topic of using positive discrimination to increase diversity in universities, a compelling argument can be made in favor of implementing such policies. Positive discrimination, often referred to as affirmative action, is a set of policies and practices that aim to provide opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups in society, including racial and ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, and others who have been underrepresented in various sectors. This form of preferential treatment is designed to address past injustices, encourage equal representation, and foster diversity within university communities. Several points can be further elaborated to support this proposition. 1. Correcting historical imbalances: Positive discrimination serves as a means to address historical and systematic marginalization of certain communities. The legacies of oppression, prejudice, and discrimination have significantly affected the representation and access to resources for these communities over generations. Implementing affirmative action in university admission policies will provide these historically disadvantaged groups a fair chance to acquire higher education and break the cycle of underrepresentation. 2. Promoting diversity: An inclusive and diverse learning environment offers tremendous benefits for all students. It fosters understanding, appreciation, and respect for different cultures, perspectives, and experiences, which can be essential in an increasingly globalized world. Encouraging diversity through positive discrimination not only benefits underrepresented students but enriches the educational experiences of the majority as well, as exposure to a variety of thought promotes intellectual growth and cultivates empathy. 3. Enhancing social cohesion and equity: The substantial increase in diversity resulting from positive discrimination policies contributes to a more equitable and integrated society. In the long run, improving access to higher education for underrepresented groups can lead to better job opportunities, greater financial security, and social mobility, which are essential for reducing societal disparities and fostering social cohesion. 4. Ensuring fair competition in the labor market: Implementing affirmative action measures in university admissions helps create a more level playing field for all students entering the workforce. With a more diverse pool of graduates, employers gain access to a broad array of talent, experiences, and insights. Furthermore, it helps to dismantle structural barriers that have historically impeded the success of disadvantaged groups in the workplace. 5. Demonstrating commitment to social change: Through positive discrimination policies, universities can show their commitment to social justice and equality, making them more attractive to prospective students who value these principles. It is a way for institutions to invest in holistic education, accepting students not only based on their academic merits but also on their potential to contribute to social change and the university community. Critics of positive discrimination argue that it may lead to reverse discrimination and undermine meritocracy. However, it is essential to recognize that such measures do not automatically exclude deserving candidates from the majority groups. Instead, they provide opportunities and fair representation to those who have been consistently marginalized and underrepresented throughout history. The ultimate objective of affirmative action policies is to create a more just, equitable, and diverse environment – one that propels society toward greater inclusivity and prosperity for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: what is dismissed? Movie title: Lemon Tree Movie plot: Salma, a Palestinian widow - living there for decades - has to stand up against her new neighbor, the Israeli Defence Minister, when he moves into his new house opposite her lemon grove, on the green line border between Israel and the West Bank. The Israeli security forces are quick to declare that Salma's trees pose a threat to the Ministers safety and issue orders to uproot them. Together with Ziad Daud, a young Palestinian lawyer, Salma goes all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court to try and save her trees. Her struggle raises the interest of Mira Navon, the Defence Minister's wife, trapped in her new home and in an unhappy life. Despite their differences, and the borders between them, the two women develop an invisible bond, while forbidden ties grow stronger between Salma and Ziad. Salmas legal and personal journey lead her deep into the complex, dark and sometimes funny chaos of the ongoing struggle in the Middle East, in which all players find themselves alone in their struggle to survive.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn. What did Bluejay say to Patch? A. Stupid blind furry groundworm! B. Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait! C. not enough information D. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands The answer to this question is:","completion":"A. Stupid blind furry groundworm! This exchange marked the beginning of an unusual friendship between Patch and the bluejay, who turned out to be Toro. Patch was able to engage in conversations with birds, thanks to his experience growing up near a nest of robins and learning to speak Bird from an early age. This ability was rare among the squirrels of the Center Kingdom, and it piqued Toro's curiosity. Over time, Patch and Toro shared countless conversations and adventures, deepening their bond and defying the natural prejudices that usually divided their respective species. It was during one of these conversations that Toro shared information about the mountains and the abundance of food to be found there. According to Toro, the mountains were a veritable treasure trove of food, a claim that would go on to hold great significance in Patch's life as he faced the challenges of finding sustenance for his fellow squirrels in the Center Kingdom. Despite having never been to the mountains himself, Patch was willing to trust his friend's word, and this knowledge would eventually lead him to risk crossing the perilous wastelands that separated their home from the mountains. While it is true that Patch had no firsthand knowledge of the food in the mountains, his trust in Toro and their unique friendship was strong enough to prompt him to consider the journey. As they would face numerous obstacles, including terrifying speeds of death machines and unleashed dogs, it was a testament to Patch's loyalty to his fellow squirrels and his unwavering faith in his friend's guidance. In conclusion, the initial interaction between Patch and Toro, where the bluejay retorted back with \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" (Answer A), opened the door to a remarkable friendship that would transcend the boundaries of species and language, as well as significantly impact the lives of squirrels in the Center Kingdom. Patch's journey across the dangerous wasteland, spurred by Toro's knowledge of the mountains and their abundant food, is a remarkable story of courage, friendship, and trust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since this picture is classified a \\"pure entertainment\\" work and since there are already many comments on it, I'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film. Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. However far away from what I expected, I saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. So what is the point? Many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? In addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's No.1 Cullinan! But the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. And they call it humour. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. Hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"In analyzing this review step-by-step, I can identify the sentiment and the main points the author is trying to convey: 1. Recognition of Marlon Wayans as the joker role in the film, implying that he plays a comedic character. Justification: The author points out that Wayans has a history of playing these types of roles and acknowledges that an actor's physical appearance can sometimes be advantageous in such roles. 2. Disappointment with the film's content and portrayal of various elements. Justification: The author cites the mix of violence, sex, and criminal activities as poorly composed and lacking common sense in the story. 3. Criticism of the film's depiction of the main character. Justification: The reviewer is displeased with the continuous attempts to portray the \\"little man\\" as a superman by highlighting his physical weaknesses and categorizes this as humor. 4. Unhappiness with the portrayal of a diamond in the film. Justification: The author argues that the depicted diamond is unrealistically large and its treatment in the movie detracts from its value and significance.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Elevating your wrist above the level of your heart will help reduce swelling and pain. It’s important to elevate your wrist for at least the first 48-72 hours after having a cast put on. Your doctor may recommend that you elevate it longer. You may also need to keep the wrist elevated while you sleep or during the day. Try propping it up on a few pillows. Icing your wrist can help reduce swelling and ease your pain. Make sure to keep your cast dry while applying ice. Put ice in a zip-top plastic bag. Make sure the bag is sealed properly to avoid leaks. Wrap the bag in a towel to make sure condensation doesn’t get into your cast. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables as an ice pack. Look for veggies that are small and even in size, such as corn or peas. (And obviously, don’t eat them after you’ve used the bag as an ice-pack.) Hold the ice on your wrist for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Apply ice for the first 2-3 days, or as long as your doctor recommends. You may also find it helpful to use a commercial gel-based ice pack. These are reusable, freezable ice packs that won’t melt and leak water onto a cast. You can find them at medical supply stores and most pharmacies. Most wrist pain can be treated with a non-prescription pain reliever. You should talk with your doctor about what type of painkiller is appropriate for you. Some can interfere with medical conditions or other medications you’re taking. Your doctor may recommend a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen/paracetamol to fight pain and reduce swelling. These are more effective together than either one is alone. Ibuprofen is an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). These help reduce fever and swelling by inhibiting your body’s production of prostaglandins. Other NSAIDs include naproxen sodium and aspirin, although aspirin has a more prolonged anti-clotting effect than other NSAIDs. Your doctor may not recommend aspirin if you have a bleeding disorder, asthma, anemia, or other medical condition. Aspirin can cause negative interactions with several medical conditions and medications. When administering pain relievers to a child, be sure to use a children’s formula and follow the dosage for the child’s age and weight. Aspirin is not recommended for children under age 18. There is a risk of liver damage when taking acetaminophen, so use only as much as recommended by your doctor. Do not take an OTC painkiller for more than 10 days (5 days in children) unless directed by your doctor. If your pain persists after 10 days, see your doctor. It’s important to exercise any joints that aren’t under the cast, such as your elbow and fingers, to keep circulation flowing. This will help speed your healing process and increase mobility. If you experience pain when moving your elbow or fingers, contact your doctor. You may find that your skin gets itchy under the cast, and you’ll probably want to scratch it. Don’t! This can cause harm to your skin or the cast. Don’t poke or stick anything into the cast. Try raising your cast or blowing on it with a hairdryer on the “low” or “cool” setting instead. Don’t put powders into the cast, either. Anti-itch powders can cause irritation when they’re trapped under the cast. Your cast may rub or irritate your skin where its edges meet your skin. You can apply moleskin, which is a soft fabric with an adhesive backing, directly to the skin where the cast is rubbing. You can purchase moleskin at drug stores and pharmacies. Apply moleskin to clean, dry skin. Replace it when it gets dirty or loses its stickiness. If the edges of your cast become rough, you can use a nail file to smooth out the rough edges. Don’t peel, cut, or break off pieces of your cast. In most cases, your wrist will heal in a few weeks with proper care. You should call your doctor if you experience any of the following: Numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers Cold, pale or blue fingers Increased pain or swelling of the area after the cast has been put on Raw or irritated skin around the edges of the cast Cracks or soft spots in the cast Wet, loose, or tight casts Casts that smell bad or itching that won’t go away Summary:","completion":"Elevating your wrist above your heart can help reduce swelling and pain. When you have a cast, keep it elevated for at least 48-72 hours. Use ice to reduce swelling, but protect your cast from getting wet. Pain can be treated with medicine, but talk to your doctor first.

Here's a detailed step by step description of the data: 1. The first piece of data is \\"Ayam penyet, ingredient, Fried chicken\\". This suggests that the main ingredient of a dish called Ayam penyet is Fried chicken. In regards to understanding and dissecting the data, Ayam penyet is seen as the 'subject', 'ingredient' is recognized as the classification or 'category', and 'Fried chicken' is the specific detail or 'information' under this classification. 2. The next data entry is \\"Java, ethnicGroup, Baduy\\". In this context, Java is the subject and it is designated as a geographic location. The 'ethnicGroup' category indicates that we are talking about the people of this area. According to the information provided, the Baduy is an ethnic group located in Java. 3. Our third piece of data is \\"Ayam penyet, region, Singapore\\", which implies that the dish again, Ayam Penyet, is related to the region named 'Singapore'. Therefore, it can be deduced that Ayam penyet is available or quite possibly, popular in Singapore. 4. The final data piece is \\"Ayam penyet, country, Java\\". Similar to the previous point, it mentions that Ayam penyet is associated with the country Java. This could mean the dish has roots in or is also popular in Java. Overall, the data provides highlights about the dish Ayam penyet (which primarily consists of Fried chicken) and its prevalence in regions like Singapore and the country of Java.

Movie plot title: The Assignment Movie plot: The film opens to the sounds of a couple having sex. Afterwards, Carlos the Jackal (Aidan Quinn) kills a spider in its web with his cigarette and evicts the woman (Lucie Laurier) from his room because he claims he has work to do. He is seen donning a disguise, and he walks to a cafe where CIA officer Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) is sitting at a table outdoors. He recognizes Shaw and asks for a light. Shaw does not recognize Carlos, because of his disguise, but he turns to watch Carlos enter the cafe. He watches as Carlos detonates a grenade, killing dozens of people. The film shows an event of attacking the OPEC meeting by the Jackal and his followers in 1975. In 1986 a man, looking like Carlos, is apprehended in an open air market and brutally interrogated by a Mossad commander named Amos (Ben Kingsley). The man claims to actually be a US Naval officer named Annibal Ramirez whose identification was lost in the chaos of his arrest. Amos confirms his identity and lets him go, stunned that Ramirez looks exactly like Carlos. Back at home, Ramirez is visited by Shaw who tries to recruit him to impersonate the terrorist leader. Ramirez, however, is deeply embittered by his rough treatment at Amos' hands, and threatens to sue. Shaw persists, confronting Ramirez with the human cost of Carlos' terrorism. He finally convinces Ramirez by showing him a photograph of child who is a victim of one of Carlos' bombings. Amos and Shaw train Ramirez at a former prison in Canada. Much of his training is devoted to situational awareness and internalizing details of Carlos' life. His training concludes with one of Carlos' ex-mistresses (CÃ©line Bonnier) training Ramirez in how to make love like Carlos. The plan revolves around convincing the KGB, which is financing his terrorism, that Carlos has begun selling information to the CIA's Counter-terrorism Division.

Answer the following question. Which European city is said to have been the first to introduce house numbers, in 1512?","completion":"The first European city to introduce house numbers is believed to be Paris, France, in the year 1512. The need for organized addressing emerged with growing cities and increased population. Paris was quickly becoming one of the must bustling centers of trade and culture in Europe during the 16th century, and with that growth came the necessity to locate people and places more efficiently. A system of house numbering was implemented in Paris in order to facilitate these needs. The numbering began in the city center and spread outward, with odd numbers typically appearing on one side of the road and even numbers on the other. The house numbers were usually indicated on a plaque, with the number being engraved or painted. This enabled the city to have a more structured layout, aiding in navigation and delivery of goods and services. However, it should be noted that the system of house numbering as we know it today – a systematic, organized and standardized approach – was developed and perfected gradually over several centuries. Paris might have pioneered this effort in the early 16th century, but house numbering became a common practice in most European cities only by the 18th century. For instance, in London, a similar numbering system was not introduced until the 18th century with the rapid expansion of the city. In Edinburgh, Scotland, an innovative system was devised in the 19th century in the New Town where the house numbering proceeds sequentially along one side of the street, and then sequentially back down the other side. Overall, while several systems of house numbering were developed and implemented across different European cities, but it was Paris that first introduced the concept in 1512, paving the way for one of the essential features of our modern urban infrastructure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Process: - The pancreas detects chemical changes in the stomach - The pancreas creates juices that help digest food - The pancreas releases the juices into the stomach - Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest protein - Insulin is produced to move glucose from the blood - The enzymes begin producing again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person has had their pancreas removed happens, how will it affect detected chemical changes in stomach. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the perturbation hypothesis In this case, the perturbation is the removal of the pancreas from the person. We need to assess the impact of this perturbation on the process described, which involves the pancreas detecting chemical changes in the stomach and its role in digestion and glucose regulation. Step 2: Identify the affected steps in the process Without the pancreas, the process will be affected in a few ways: - The pancreas will not be able to detect chemical changes in the stomach, as it is no longer present. - It will not create digestive juices (pancreatic enzymes), as it is removed. - There will be no release of pancreatic juices into the stomach. - The production of trypsin and chymotrypsin, enzymes responsible for protein digestion, is impacted, as they are produced by the pancreas. - Insulin production is affected, as it is released by the pancreas to regulate glucose levels in the blood. Step 3: Assess the direct effects of the perturbation Direct effects: - Since the pancreas is absent, it will not produce enzymes for digestion. This means that protein digestion may be insufficient and not properly carried out. - It will not secrete insulin, affecting the regulation of blood glucose. Step 4: Assess the indirect effects of the perturbation Indirect effects: - Inadequate protein digestion could lead to nutritional deficiencies as the body isn't able to effectively break down and absorb proteins. - A lack of insulin will result in high blood sugar levels, leading to a condition called hyperglycemia. This can cause complications such as diabetes, impaired vision, nerve damage, and kidney issues. Conclusion: The perturbation of removing the pancreas has both direct and indirect effects on the process. The pancreas plays a significant role in digestion and glucose regulation, and its removal disrupts these functions, potentially leading to both impaired digestive functioning and issues related to glucose management in the body."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Over 60 thousand people would live or work here. Millennium's designers think it represents the best solution for the coming population explosion. It would cost ten billion dollars and consume more building materials than any single nation could produce. David Nelson, one of Millennium's key designers, said:\\"It would be a massive project and a world project. But to actually realize it, resources would have to come from all over the globe.

It has been shown that teenagers, perhaps more than any other age group, need companionship and a sense of belonging. The negative consequences of loneliness have also been observed among the elderly. The death of a spouse often leaves a widow or a widower totally bereft .

The degree or intensity of friendship varies depending on the personality of the individuals involved and the context of the relationships. Extroverts enjoy being surrounded by many people whereas introverts are perhaps content with fewer but more intense friendships. Everyone is not equally open with all their friends. The degree of intimacy is determined by many factors. Close friends can be formed at any stage in one's life but they are usually very rare.

Is \\"Exceptions to the restrictions faced by Windows Store apps are given to web browsers.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What different options did the desktop version have?\\"","completion":"While the statement \\"Exceptions to the restrictions faced by Windows Store apps are given to web browsers\\" highlights that web browsers in the Windows Store have certain privileges, it doesn't thoroughly answer the question \\"What different options did the desktop version have?\\" To provide a detailed and more comprehensive response, we can break down the differences between desktop versions of software and Windows Store apps. In the context of Windows, there are two major types of software: desktop applications and Windows Store apps. Desktop applications are traditional software that users have been running on Windows for years, while Windows Store apps (also known as Universal Windows Platform, or UWP apps) are a relatively newer breed introduced with Windows 8 and further developed in Windows 10. Here are some key differences between desktop and Windows Store apps: 1. Installation and Updates: Desktop applications can be downloaded and installed from various sources, which requires the user to manage updates manually or rely on the application’s built-in update system. Windows Store apps, on the other hand, are downloaded, installed, and updated automatically through the store, providing a more streamlined user experience. 2. Compatibility: Desktop applications generally have wider compatibility across different versions of Windows, while Windows Store apps are specifically designed for newer versions of Windows, such as Windows 8 and Windows 10. 3. User Interface: Desktop applications typically have more complex and feature-rich user interfaces, while Windows Store apps are designed for touch-enabled devices, adhering to modern design guidelines and offering simpler, more intuitive interfaces. 4. System Access: Desktop applications typically have more extensive access to system resources and features, such as the file system, hardware components, and various settings. Windows Store apps are more restricted by default and operate in a sandboxed environment, though specific exceptions can be made for certain apps (such as web browsers) to access additional capabilities. 5. Background Processes: Desktop applications can run background processes more freely and can launch at startup. Windows Store apps are limited in terms of background processing capabilities and require user permission to launch at startup. 6. Multitasking: Desktop applications typically support more advanced multitasking options, such as floating windows, resizable windows, and support for multiple monitors. Windows Store apps, however, are primarily designed for full-screen or fixed-size window operation. 7. Performance: In general, desktop applications have greater control over system resources, potentially leading to better performance. However, Windows Store apps can take advantage of specific optimizations and platform features that may lead to better battery life and less strain on system resources. To answer the original question, a better statement would be: \\"In comparison to Windows Store apps, desktop versions typically have broader compatibility, more complex user interfaces, greater access to system resources, support for advanced multitasking, and the ability to run background processes. While Windows Store apps face certain restrictions, exceptions are sometimes made for specific apps, such as web browsers, granting them additional capabilities.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

Write a title for this article: ABBOTTABAD, Pakistan – Pakistan on Saturday began demolishing the three-story compound where Usama bin Laden lived for years and was killed by U.S. commandos last May, eliminating a concrete reminder of the painful and embarrassing chapter in the country's history. Pakistan was outraged by the covert American raid because it was not told about it beforehand. The country's powerful military faced rare domestic criticism because it was not able to stop U.S. troops from infiltrating the country by helicopter from Afghanistan under the cover of darkness. The compound was located next to Pakistan's equivalent of West Point, the elite U.S. military academy. Three mechanized backhoes began demolishing the compound in the northwest town of Abbottabad after sunset on Saturday, said two local residents, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were afraid of being harassed by the government. Authorities set up floodlights so they could work after dark, the residents said. The demolition team conducted its work under heavy security. A large team of police set up an outer cordon around the compound to keep spectators away, said an Associated Press reporter who managed to get close enough to see the demolition work under way. A ring of army soldiers set up an inner cordon and warmed themselves against the winter chill by lighting a bonfire. The backhoes broke through tall outer boundary walls that ringed a courtyard where one of the U.S. helicopters crashed during the operation to kill the Al Qaeda chief. They then began to tear down the compound itself. A Pakistani intelligence official confirmed that the demolition was in progress but declined to say why the government chose to do it. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Residents of the normally sleepy town of Abbottabad were divided on what the government should do with the compound in the aftermath of the raid. Some thought it should be destroyed, but others believed it should be turned into a tourist attraction to help the town earn money. There was always the danger, however, that it could also draw Al Qaeda supporters. American officials said they buried bin Laden's body at sea to avoid giving his followers a burial place that could become a makeshift shrine. Many U.S. officials expressed disbelief that bin Laden could have lived in Abbottabad for around six years without the Pakistani government knowing. But the U.S. has not found any evidence that senior Pakistani officials knew the Al Qaeda chief's whereabouts. The U.S. did not give Pakistan advance warning of the raid, which lasted about 40 minutes, because it was worried someone in the country's military or shadowy intelligence agency would tip off bin Laden. The operation was a serious blow to the already troubled U.S.-Pakistan relationship. Pakistan responded to the raid by kicking out more than 100 U.S. troops training Pakistanis in counter-terrorism operations and reduced the level of intelligence cooperation.","completion":"Title: \\"Pakistan Demolishes Bin Laden's Compound: Erasing a Painful Past and Controversial Landmark Amidst National Outrage\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frankenstein believes he can transfer that soul into another recently deceased body to restore it to life. Hans is now also the lover of Christina (Susan Denberg), daughter of innkeeper Herr Kleve. Christina's entire left side is disfigured and partly paralysed. Young dandies Anton (Peter Blythe), Johann (Derek Fowlds) and Karl (Barry Warren) frequent Kleve's inn where they taunt Christina and refuse to pay. Johann threatens to have his father revoke Kleve's license if he complains. The three insist that they be served by Christina and mock her for her deformities. The taunting angers Hans, who gets in a fight with the three of them and cuts Anton's face with a knife. Eventually Kleve throws the dandies out for non-payment. They return in the night to steal wine from his inn. Kleve catches them and they beat him to death. Hans, the son of a murderer known for his short temper, is convicted. Despite the Baron and Hertz's defences against the accusations, Hans is executed by the guillotine, much to Anton, Johann and Karl's delight. Seeing this as an opportunity, Frankenstein gets hold of Hans' fresh corpse and traps his soul.

They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable. Will deer birth rates be higher or lower if there has been less available food this year when compared to last year? Answer:","completion":"Deer birth rates will likely be lower if there has been less available food this year when compared to last year. Food availability plays a crucial role in determining the reproductive success of deer populations. When there's less food available, it can lead to several factors that contribute to lower birth rates: 1. Lower body condition: If female deer (does) have difficulty finding enough food, their body condition may suffer, making them less likely to conceive or successfully carry a pregnancy to term. Adequate nutrition is necessary for normal reproductive cycles and the development of healthy fawns. 2. Delayed conception: When food is scarce, does may experience a delay in reaching the optimal body condition necessary for successful conception, resulting in a reduction in conceived fawns. 3. Lower offspring survival: If pregnant does aren't able to find sufficient food to support the growth of their offspring, the likelihood of fawn survival decreases. Malnourished fawns with low body weights have a lower chance of surviving after birth and are also more susceptible to illnesses. 4. Reduced twin births: When food is abundant, does are more likely to give birth to twins. However, in times of food scarcity, the likelihood of producing twins decreases, which in turn lowers overall birth rates for the deer population. In summary, when food availability is low, deer populations typically experience lower birth rates as a result of poorer reproductive success, delayed conception, reduced offspring survival, and fewer twin births. Consequently, deer population management strategies, such as hunting license recommendations, would need to take into consideration these factors to maintain a stable and healthy deer population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: 'Nerdprom' 2014: Highlights From the White House Correspondents' Dinner By Andrew Freedman and Jonathan Ellis2014-05-03 21:06:00 -0400 Julia Louis-Dreyfus and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden teamed up for a romp through Washington, President Barack Obama cracked jokes at his own expense and Joel McHale's mockery of political figures certainly twisted the knife — sometimes, perhaps, too deep. It was the annual dinner of the White House Correspondents' Association on Saturday night, which has essentially become an annual roast. Dubbed \\"nerdprom,\\" the event features a sometimes awkward mix of political journalists, Hollywood celebrities, star athletes and even a few tech titans, alongside Washington politicians including the president and first lady. Obama still had the timing and delivery that has sometimes earned him the title comedian-in-chief, but his jokes were pointed and he seemed all too aware that he's had a tough year. McHale's routine was far from anodyne — he dinged Obama for his \\"joke\\" of vowing to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, and repeatedly laid into New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. He veered closer to Stephen Colbert's controversial 2006 performance, earning a more muted reception from the live audience. But first, Obama's remarks were preceded by a video featuring Louis-Dreyfus, star of HBO's Veep, scheming with Biden as fellow \\"vice presidents,\\" and running into other political stars: Money shot @VP @OfficialJLD #nerdprom #WHCD2014 pic.twitter.com/Ak2QP7L2el — Jeremy Art (@cspanJeremy) May 4, 2014 — HuffPost Politics (@HuffPostPol) May 4, 2014 Obama on having a U.S. citizen win the Boston Marathon. “Only fair since a Kenyan has been president for the past six.” #WHCD — MashableLIVE (@MashableLive) May 4, 2014 \\"Orange is the new black\\"- President Obama zinger about Speaker Boehner. #WHCD #nerdprom pic.twitter.com/xHgdK10czZ — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 4, 2014 “Gridlock has gotten so bad in this town, it makes you wonder, what did we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad?” Obama at #WHCD — MashableLIVE (@MashableLive) May 4, 2014 \\"I just show up in the Oval Office everyday and do my job.\\" - Obama #WHCD #nerdprom pic.twitter.com/xfR5qyP6wJ — Steve King (@steveking_) May 4, 2014 Wow.

Chris Christie's \\"Bridgegate\\" scandal: Governor, do you want bridge jokes or size jokes? 'Cause I’ve got a bunch of both. I could go half and half. I know you like a combo platter. Now, I get that. I’m sorry for that joke, Governor Christie. I didn’t know I was going to tell it but I take full responsibility for it. Whoever wrote it, will be fired. But the buck stops here. So, I will be a man and own up to it, just as soon as I get to the bottom of how it happened because I was unaware it happened until just now. I am appointing a blue-ribbon commission of me to investigate the joke I just told and if I find any wrongdoing on my part, I assure you I will be dealt with. I just looked into it.

Solve 3*s - 2 = -5 for s.","completion":"Okay, let's break this down like a game: Right now, there's a little math problem that says 3 times some mystery number (we're calling that \\"s\\") minus 2 equals -5. That looks like this: 3s - 2 = -5. We need to find out what that mystery number is! First, let's try to get rid of that minus 2 that's bothering our mystery number (s). We can do this by doing the opposite, which is adding 2. But to keep things fair, we have to do the same thing to both sides of the equals sign. So we're going to add 2 to both side, so we get: 3s - 2 + 2 = -5 + 2 This simplifies to: 3s = -3 (Because -5 plus 2 equals -3). Now, we just have 3 times a mystery number equals -3. In other words, 3s = -3. We need to solve for our mystery number (s), which means we need to get rid of that 3 that's being multiplied. We can do this by doing the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing! So, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find out what s is: 3s / 3 = -3 / 3 This simplifies to: s = -1 (Because -3 divided by 3 equals -1). So, our mystery number s is -1!

Please answer the following question: Information: - Nassau is the capital, largest city, and commercial centre of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The city has an estimated population of 274,400 as of 2016, or 70 percent of the entire population of the Bahamas. Lynden Pindling International Airport, the major airport for the Bahamas, is located about west of Nassau city centre, and has daily flights to major cities in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The city is located on the island of New Providence, which functions much like a business district. Nassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates. The city was named in honour of William III of England, Prince of Orange-Nassau. - The Olympic Games (\\"Olympia\\", \\"the Olympics\\" also \\"the Olympiad\\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in 393 AD as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or \\"olympiad\\", which became a unit of time in historical chronologies. - Dominic Demeritte ( born February 22 , 1978 in Nassau , Bahamas ) is a track and field sprinter who specializes in the 200 metres . - The Bahamas, known officially as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago. It consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic); northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands; southeast of the US state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys. The state capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of \\"The Bahamas\\" can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses of ocean space. - Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass. Sometimes the runners are referred to as \\"harriers\\" (dogs). The course, typically long, may include surfaces of grass, and earth, pass through woodlands and open country, and include hills, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an individual and a team sport; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during autumn and winter, and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - New Providence is the most populous island in the Bahamas, containing more than 70% of the total population. It houses the national capital city of Nassau. The island was originally under Spanish control following Christopher Columbus's discovery of the New World, but the Spanish government showed little interest in developing the island (and the Bahamas as a whole). Nassau, the island's largest city, was formerly known as Charles-town, but it was burned to the ground by the Spanish in 1684. It was laid out and renamed Nassau in 1695 by Nicholas Trott, the most successful Lord Proprietor, in honor of the Prince of Orange-Nassau who became William III of England. The three branches of Bahamian Government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary, are all headquartered on New Providence. New Providence functions as the main commercial hub of the Bahamas. It is also home to more than 400 banks and trust companies, and its hotels and port account for more than two thirds of the four million-plus tourists who visit the Bahamas annually. Other settlements on New Providence include Grants Town, Bain Town, Fox Hill, Adelaide, Yamacraw, South Beach, Coral Harbour, Lyford Cay, Paradise Island, Sea Breeze, Centreville, The Grove (South) and The Grove (West Bay), Cable Beach, Delaporte, Gambier, and Love Beach. - Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running, jumping, and throwing. The name is derived from the sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking. - The 200 metres (also spelled 200 meters) is a sprint running event. On an outdoor 400 m track, the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight, so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race. A slightly shorter race, called the \\"stadion\\" and run on a straight track, was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games. The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes rely on different energy systems during the longer sprint. - Lynden Pindling International Airport , formerly known as Nassau International Airport, is the largest airport in the Bahamas and the largest international gateway into the country. It is a major hub for Bahamasair and is located in western New Providence island near the capital city of Nassau.

Please answer the following question: This article: In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person Ray pleaded with to return for the sessions for their upcoming album?, what is it ?

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend.

The reviewer seems to be indicating that, over time, the film's content weighs down on the plot, possibly making it difficult to follow or enjoy. Such a remark suggests that the movie might have had too many subplots, conflicting storylines, or unnecessarily complex narrative elements, which inadvertently affect the overall viewing experience for the audience. It's important to recognize that individuals have unique perspectives and opinions on movies, and what might seem negative to one person could be viewed as a minor issue by another. In this specific sentence, it's clear that the reviewer experienced some level of dissatisfaction with how the film's events impacted its plot, insinuating that the movie's storytelling could have been executed more effectively. Nevertheless, it's important to acknowledge that this sentence alone does not provide a comprehensive judgment of the film. To better understand the reviewer's overall opinion and whether they would recommend the movie, it would be beneficial to read the entire review for a broader context. By doing so, one can determine if this issue significantly detracted from the film's strengths and merits, or if it was just a single negative aspect amidst positive qualities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a title for this article: A Qatari man hospitalized in London is suffering a severe infection in the same family as the SARS virus that killed hundreds and sickened thousands across the globe roughly a decade ago, the World Health Organization and British authorities have announced. The hospitalized man is the second of two known cases this year. The 49-year-old man, who had a history of traveling to Saudi Arabia, showed symptoms of the illness three weeks ago and was admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha four days later, according to WHO officials. He was transferred to Britain by air ambulance on Sept. 11. The virus, detected with laboratory testing, was very similar to another virus that killed a 60-year-old patient from Saudi Arabia earlier this year, the health organization said in a statement Sunday. Both are coronaviruses, a large family of viruses that cause a range of ailments from the common cold to SARS. The two people known to have been infected with the new virus were struck with fever, coughing and shortness of breath. The new virus is different than any previously identified in humans, the British Health Protection Agency said. Health officials are still investigating where it came from and how it is spread; similar viruses are typically passed when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. o far, there is no evidence that the two infected people passed the virus to other people they were in contact with, including healthcare workers, the British agency said. The virus does not appear to be highly contagious, since if it were, there would likely be more cases by this point, it explained. “Based on what we know about other coronaviruses, many of these contacts will already have passed the period when they could have caught the virus from the infected person,” the agency added. But a “small number” of other recent cases of severe respiratory illness in the Middle East are being investigated to check if they are linked. The WHO has yet to recommend any travel restrictions. “Given that this is a novel coronavirus, WHO is currently in the process of obtaining further information to determine the public health implications of these two confirmed cases,” it said. Saudi officials are particularly concerned about the upcoming Hajj pilgrimage that brings millions of people to Saudi Arabia, advising pilgrims to wear masks in crowded places and keep their hands clean, the Associated Press reported. The pilgrimage has been the epicenter of previous disease outbreaks. Former police chief in China gets 15-year sentence in scandal World of woe, little hope of relief, await U.N.

Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship.

On another warm, benign day, the 21-year-old Texan picked up Friday morning right where he ended his blistering first round of 64. Spieth birdied two of the first five holes and stood at 11-under as he made the turn. Birdies on the 10th, 13th, 15th holes, brought him to 14-under par, even though he laid up on the two par-five holes in the back nine. Spieth’s gallery started big and swelled as the day wore on, as fans peeled off the trail of Tiger Woods, who struggled to stay even, and flocked to the golfer who is now poised to register one of the most resounding wins here since Woods in 1997. Spieth climbed the hill to the 18th green to a rousing ovation. There, he burned the left edge of the hole on a seven-foot birdie putt for a rare miss, then knocked in for par from two feet. There is plenty of golf left though, and a 38-year-old journeyman named Charley Hoffman lurking just five shots back. Poor Hoffman, who is playing for only the second time here, picked the breakout tournament for the game’s next big star to play two of the best rounds of his life. Hoffman started the day at five-under and was at 10-under through 14 holes. The two will likely go head-to-head Saturday, with no one else within five shots.","completion":"Jordan Spieth seized control of the 79th Masters by setting a 36-hole scoring record, which had stood since 1976.

[+] scouring pad is gentle.","completion":"Mary followed her mother's advice and cleaned her nonstick pan with a microfiber cloth instead of a scouring pad because the microfiber cloth is gentle. Nonstick pans are designed with a specific coating that helps to prevent food from adhering to the surface, making it easier for users to cook and clean. However, this nonstick coating can be quite delicate, and using an abrasive or harsh cleaning tool like a scouring pad can damage the surface of the pan, leading to a loss of its nonstick qualities. To ensure the longevity of her nonstick pan, Mary decided to follow her mother's advice and clean it with a microfiber cloth. Microfiber cloths are made of a blend of tiny synthetic fibers that are incredibly soft and gentle. These fibers are much less likely to scratch or damage delicate surfaces like a nonstick pan coating. The texture of microfiber cloths allows them to easily lift and remove grime, grease, and stuck-on food particles without damaging the pan's nonstick properties. In contrast, a scouring pad is designed for more rigorous and abrasive cleaning tasks. While scouring pads can be effective on tough and stubborn stains, using them on nonstick pans can cause irreparable damage to the nonstick coating. The abrasive fibers in a scouring pad could create tiny scratches on the surface of the pan, leading to the deterioration of the nonstick properties over time. In addition to being gentle on nonstick surfaces, microfiber cloths have other advantages that make them suitable for cleaning nonstick pans. They are highly absorbent, able to hold up to several times their weight in water, which allows them to effectively remove grease and other residues. They can also be easily washed and reused, making them a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective option than disposable cleaning materials. It is important to note that, while cleaning a nonstick pan using a microfiber cloth is an excellent choice, the pan should not be cleaned using excessively harsh chemicals, as they can also damage the nonstick surface. Instead, it is typically recommended to use warm water and a mild dish soap for cleaning nonstick pans, in combination with the gentle microfiber cloth. In summary, Mary decided to follow her mother's advice and clean her nonstick pan with a microfiber cloth instead of a scouring pad because the microfiber cloth is gentle and far less likely to damage the delicate nonstick surface. By making this choice, Mary helps to extend the lifespan of her pan and maintain its nonstick properties for many future cooking experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:However, there was still one more round of fixtures to cram in before the season's first month came to a conclusion. Emotional tributes, a superb winning run extended and a fortysomething still turning out in League Two; BBC Sport has picked out some of the day's main talking points from the Football League. Ipswich Town 2-3 Brighton & Hove Albion The players and staff at Brighton & Hove Albion have been more affected than most by the Shoreham air disaster, in which 11 people died. One of the victims, Matt Grimstone, was a member of the ground staff at the Championship club's training ground and played for non-league side Worthing United. Grimstone's Worthing team-mate, Jacob Schilt, also died. He was a Brighton supporter. Seven days on from the disaster, various events were held near the crash site to remember the victims. Brighton's players wore black armbands during Saturday's game at Ipswich, while goalkeeper David Stockdale paid his own tribute by wearing personalised gloves and a special warm-up top before kick-off. The Seagulls won 3-2 at Portman Road, Tomer Hemed's brace sending Chris Hughton's side top of the Championship table. \\"The club has done an incredible job in helping the local police and everyone wanted to do well for Matt and Jacob,\\" said Hughton. At full-time, Stockdale pointed to the sky - gloves in one hand, black armband in the other. Brentford 1-3 Reading Heard the one about the football pitch that was re-laid after the opening match of the season? There were several complaints about the Griffin Park surface following Brentford's draw with Ipswich on the opening day. Ipswich midfielder Ryan Fraser said he had never played on one so bad. An under-soil drainage system that had been installed during the summer had caused serious problems. So, after one game of the campaign, the pitch was ripped up and replaced. The work caused one of their matches to be postponed, but Brentford were back on home soil on Saturday to take on Reading. Unfortunately for the Bees, it was anything but familiar turf as they lost 3-1 on their brand new surface. Blackpool 0-4 Walsall Walsall can do no wrong at the moment. A 4-0 win at Blackpool on Saturday was their sixth victory in a row in all competitions. That run of form has taken them to the top of League One and into the third round of the League Cup, where faltering Premier League champions Chelsea await. \\"It's great when things work out like they are doing, but we know we have to be at our best every game,\\" Walsall manager Dean Smith told BBC WM 95.6. As for Blackpool, their misery continues. One point from five games leaves them bottom of the table. Bradford City 1-0 Port Vale It's not been unusual to see the name \\"Cole\\" on a scoresheet in England over the past couple of decades. Former Manchester United striker Andrew Cole was one of the Premier League's most feared front men, and now his son - albeit two levels down the English football pyramid - is hoping to do the same. Devante Cole swapped Manchester City for Bradford City on Friday and he marked his first appearance for the Bantams with a stoppage-time winner against Port Vale 24 hours later. The 20-year-old, who netted his 11th career goal on Saturday, still has some way to go to match his father, who scored 187 in the Premier League alone. But it's a good way to start. Dagenham & Redbridge 1-1 Stevenage Evergreen striker Jamie Cureton, who turned 40 on Friday, continues to be a genuine goalscoring threat at League Two level. He received congratulatory tweets from many of his former clubs, and was presented with a special shirt before Dagenham's home game with Stevenage on Saturday. But there was to be no late birthday present for the former Norwich and Bristol Rovers forward, who had two shots cleared off the line in a 1-1 draw.

Somatic mutations occur in non-reproductive cells (those not part of the germline) and thus do not get inherited by offspring. These mutations generally affect only the individual organism in which they occur.

Cancer patients who receive several weeks of radiation treatment could soon be a thing of the past, with doctors developing an Australian-first single session therapy in a handful of minutes. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne has trialled a powerful new technique that could enable patients to safely receive their radiation treatment in a single, ten-minute session. Radiation Oncologist Dr Shankar Siva said since 2010, patients at the centre have been treated with high-dose Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation Therapy (SABR) over a six to eight week period. But a team of experts have used a combination of the complex modelling calculations to allow doctors to deliver higher dosages and reduce treatment time even further. Scroll down for video. Cancer patients who receive several weeks of radiation treatment could soon be a thing of the past. By removing the laser's filter, the new flattening filter-free SABR treatment will enable doctors to control the peak power of the radiation beam. 'Our medical physicists have now introduced an innovative method to predict the stereotactic beam to deliver to a tumour a 'knock-out punch' of up to 28 Gray of radiation in a single session over only a handful of minutes,' Dr Siva said. 'This shift is particularly important for our older patients who cannot lie still for prolonged periods and for others who are in discomfort due to their disease.' Cancer patient Harold Sciberras ,80, was the first in Victoria to undergo the treatment on Friday. Dr Shankar Siva (right) with Clinical Research Physicist Associate Professor Annette Haworth in Victoria. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne has trialled a powerful new technique that could enable patients to safely receive their radiation treatment in a single, ten-minute session. SABR is used to treat small secondary tumours that have spread short distances from the primary tumour, or inoperable primary cancers in highly sensitive locations such as the lung, and is typically delivered over three to five treatment sessions of 40–60 minutes each. Cancer patient Harold Sciberras was the first in Victoria to undergo the treatment on Friday with a small primary lung cancer in his right lung irradiated. The 80-year-old was wrapped in a vacuum-sealed plastic slip while a 4D CT scanner tracked the tumour's position, enabling treatment to be delivered with greater accuracy and fewer side-effects. 'The location of the tumour makes it very difficult to operate or target with conventional radiation without affecting my healthy lung tissue, so this new technique has certainly come at the right time for me, and many others in my situation,' Sciberras said. Dr Siva said SABR has been a game changer for people with difficult to treat tumours. Patient Harold Sciberras said the new technique has certainly come at the right time for him and many others. 'The best news is I will be back at home in Diggers Rest tonight, and I will only need to return to Peter Mac for follow-up appointments.' Dr Siva added that SABR has been a game changer for people with difficult to treat tumours. 'The sharp delineation of the stereotactic beam greatly reduces damage to healthy tissue and allows for a higher dose through faster, more targeted delivery of radiation therapy and now, thanks to the work of our team, we can deliver this in one controlled blow for some of our patients,' Dr Siva said. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Doctors in Australia are working on a new technique that could help cancer patients receive their radiation treatment in just one, ten-minute session, instead of several weeks of treatment. This new method uses Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation Therapy (SABR) to give a very strong and precise radiation dose to the tumor in a very short time. This is especially helpful for older patients or people who have trouble lying still for a long time during regular treatments. An 80-year-old cancer patient was the first to try this new treatment and it was successful for him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In psychiatry, emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood.

Your symptoms will also depend on what type of cancer you have. However, it is likely that you will deal with many physical changes. Finding ways to feel physically better can help you handle your illness. Your doctor will be one of your greatest resources. After you have processed the initial diagnosis, schedule a follow-up appointment. Prepare a list of questions to ask. Writing them down ahead of time will help you remember key points. You can ask things such as, \\"How will this affect my energy levels and my appetite?\\" You could also say, \\"Are there any physical restrictions I should be aware of?\\" You may also want to ask about your short-term and long-term prognosis. Ask your doctor to be as honest and specific as possible. After you begin to understand your particular type of cancer, you can begin working to make a treatment plan. Many people feel better when they feel like they have a little bit of control over their medical care. Tell your doctor that you want to be involved in decision making. Discuss whether you are going to pursue the most aggressive treatment possible. Sometimes surgery is an option but comes with risks. Talk to your doctor about all of your options. Give yourself time to think about each possible course of treatment. Involve your partner or a close family member in your decision-making process. It can be beneficial to have some advice from a person you are close to. Ask your partner to accompany you to your medical appointments. He or she can help you process all of the information you are taking in. Your treatment plan should also include ways to handle the day to day symptoms you will experience. Talk to your doctor about the potential side effects of your illness and medications. Make a plan to cope with anticipated physical symptoms. Many cancer patients deal with pain. Talk to your doctor about prescription pain killers and natural remedies. Loss of appetite is another common problem. Keep foods on hand that are easier to digest, such as soup and oatmeal. Chemotherapy drugs can cause fatigue. Allow yourself extra time to rest. You might also feel better if you can do light physical activity, such as taking a short walk. Your sex drive might suffer. Have an honest conversation with your partner about other ways to still have intimacy. Try extra hugging and cuddling. It is important to try to be as healthy as possible when you are dealing with cancer. Your body needs plenty of nutrients to fight your illness. Try to eat a healthy diet. A balanced diet can help you fight fatigue. Try to eat whole grains, plenty of fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins. If you are having trouble keeping foods down, try eating some homemade vegetable soup. You'll get lots of nutrients and hopefully avoid upsetting your stomach. Remember to stay hydrated. Cancer medications can cause dry mouth and cracked skin, so it is important to drink as much water as possible. Get plenty of rest. Allow yourself to take naps as needed and go to bed as early as you like. Average adults need 7-9 hours of sleep. You may need more. Although it is frustrating, you may not be able to complete all of your regular tasks. It's okay to delegate some of your responsibilities. Allow your friends and family to help. When people offer to help, take them up on it. If your neighbor asks what she can do, it is perfectly fine to say, \\"It would be so helpful if you could pick up a few things for me the next time you are at the grocery store.\\" Ask your partner to take over some extra responsibilities around the house. Maybe you've traditionally been the cook. It's okay to take some time off from making dinner. Talk to your boss about your situation. Explain that you may need to take a reduced role on some big projects.","completion":"Cancer affects everyone differently, and managing it requires understanding your specific symptoms and needs. Consult your doctor for information and involve them in decision-making, discussing treatment options and addressing side effects. Include a trusted family member or partner in appointments to help process information and make decisions.

Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three.

Title: Stir of Echoes Movie plot: Tom Witzky is a phone lineman living in a working-class neighborhood in Chicago with his pregnant wife Maggie and his son Jake, who possesses the ability to commune with the dead. At a party one evening, Tom challenges Maggie's sister Lisa, a believer in paranormal activity, to hypnotize him. After putting him under, Lisa plants a post-hypnotic suggestion in Tom urging him to \\"be more open-minded\\". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior. While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the 'L' station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. During an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; here a policeman named Neil immediately recognizes Jake's unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of like-minded people to learn more about what is happening to his son. Maggie withholds her conversation with Neil from Tom and goes to the meeting herself, and Neil tells her the spirit... Answer:","completion":"Tom Witzky"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My salad contained no herbs other than what was in the vinaigrette dressing I had on the side. Capital Grille should rename it the \\"Iceberg Lettuce and Tomatoes\\" salad. - My 2 buddies had each ordered soup with their fish entrees. Both buddies said that the waiter had made it seem that the 11/soup would be complimentary (since it was our first time eating at Capital Grille or whatever). I wasn't paying attention to what the waiter said when he was discussing the menu, but I'll side with both of my friends (word of my 2 friends vs. the word of 1 waiter) who say they were mislead into ordering the soup. Had my friends known it wasn't complimentary, they wouldn't have bothered ordering the soup. Pros: - Great location overlooking the northern end of the Strip. - Aside from the soup problem, the service was great. - Fancy decor, nice ambiance.","completion":"To determine the sentiment of this review, I will go step by step through the text and analyze the positive and negative statements.

Great location overlooking the northern end of the Strip. 2. Good service, with the exception of the soup issue. 3. Fancy decor and nice ambiance. The review appears to have both positive and negative aspects, but due to the dissatisfaction expressed over the salad and the soup issue, it leans more towards a negative sentiment.

Detective Mike Hoolihan is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell, an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect. Figuring from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree.

Given the question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.smc.inputmethod.indic. The answer is:","completion":"I recently downloaded the org.smc.inputmethod.indic app, with the hope of improving my typing experience, specifically for Indian languages. However, I've been extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with the overall performance of the app, so much so, that I feel compelled to provide a detailed, 1-star (lowest possible rating) review to share my grievances and warn potential users against wasting their time and bandwidth on this app. Upon launching the app, one of the first issues I encountered was the user interface (UI). It's clunky, outdated and far from being user-friendly. The colors used hurt the eyes, and navigating between different features seemed like a labyrinth. In an era where a sleek, interactive interface is integral to the success of an app, org.smc.inputmethod.indic falls short, failing to capture a user's attention or adhere to modern design standards. Moreover, the typing functionality itself leaves a lot to be desired. The app is plagued by bugs and inaccuracies when predicting words and suggesting auto-corrections. This makes it extremely frustrating to type in Indian languages – particularly the ones I use the most, such as Hindi and Bengali. In my experience, the incorrect word suggestions drastically slowed down my typing speed because I needed to manually correct almost every word. Another glaring issue was the absence of critical language support. While the app primarily targets Indian languages, it lacked support for some languages or even specific character sets used in those languages. If your desired language is missing from the app, you're left with no alternative but to find another solution. Adding to the list of downsides, org.smc.inputmethod.indic app consumes an exorbitant amount of battery life. It was shocking to find that using this app as my primary input method drained my phone's battery at an alarming rate. This puts your device at risk of running out of power when you require it the most, especially during critical work or study sessions. Privacy is another concern when using this app. The permissions required by the software seem excessive and intrusive – far beyond what is necessary for a simple input method app. Additionally, there is no clear indication of the data being collected and how it's used, posing a significant potential risk to users' privacy. Lastly, the customer support for org.smc.inputmethod.indic app is practically non-existent. My repeated attempts to contact the developers to voice my concerns went unanswered. It seems like there is no way to reach them, and the general lack of communication only compounds user frustration. In summary, I strongly discourage downloading the org.smc.inputmethod.indic app. From its poor user interface and unresponsive customer support to the intrusive privacy demands and abysmal performance – it's an experience best avoided. There are several other Indian language input apps available in the market, many of which deliver more efficient, accurate, and user-friendly experiences as opposed to this sub-par offering. I sincerely wish I had discovered them earlier, saving myself the wasted time, frustration, and battery life that came with using the org.smc.inputmethod.indic app."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - You take a tray - Add water into the tray - You insert the tray into a freezer - The water molecules begin to slow down - The water becomes ice - The ice cubes are ready.

Context: I do not fully understand exactly what you are asking so I will restate what I believe you are asking and then I will answer it. What was the best excuse that a student ever gave for having failed to do something? I would have to say that I was most entertained by a student’s response to “Why are you late for school?” The student said, “I awoke in time this morning but there was a mouse sitting on the edge of my bed. I looked at him and he looked back. The mouse said to me, ‘Go back to sleep’ and what could I do? He had a gun.” The following has worked a few times too when students refuse to talk. That is, I know that one of the assembled students was the culprit for some activity. When they will not talk, I interview them one at a time while the others are kept away from each other. Then when they are assembled before me again, I say, “Thank you gentlemen. I know who did it so you others are free to return to class.” All but one arises and leaves. This works more times than not.

Prior to her death, Bellette bequeathed the Hill End cottage to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (which manages the Hill End historic site), on condition that it be used as an artists' retreat. It continues to operate for that purpose. As of 2016, Bellette is the only woman to have won the Sulman Prize on more than one occasion. A large number of her works are held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales; other galleries that hold examples include the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Bendigo Art Gallery, Geelong Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. In 2004–05, a major retrospective exhibition was held at Bathurst Regional Art Gallery, the S. H.

In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Throughout the early years of the July Monarchy, Alkan continued to teach and play at public concerts and in eminent social circles. He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da camera for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo...

Bellows work by forcing air, rich in oxygen, towards the fire. This increase in available oxygen helps the fire to burn hotter and brighter. Oxygen serves as a fuel source for the fire, so providing more of it aids in combustion. Therefore, the correct answer to your question is 'increase'. The other response options don't accurately depict the action of bellows on oxygen around a fire: - Evaporation and absorb aren't relevant terms in this context since we are discussing transferring oxygen, not moisture or substances. - Diminish and decrease would suggest the reduction of oxygen, which is the opposite of what a bellows does. - \\"It expands\\" could be partially true since forcing air can cause it to disperse, but it doesn't directly speak about the impact on oxygen. - Electrically and heat aren't correct in the context of how a bellows influences the oxygen near a fire.

Fighting also erupted in Central Europe, as the Austrians launched another attack against the French in 1809. Napoleon defeated them at the Battle of Wagram, dissolving the Fifth Coalition formed against France. By 1811, Napoleon ruled over 70 million people across an empire that had domination in Europe, which had not witnessed this level of political consolidation since the days of the Roman Empire.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose \\"romantically classical\\" approach was commented on by reviewers?, using the article: Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects.

A Chinese man has been left with horrific burns after he fainted and fell onto the scorching ground which started to melt his skin. These pictures show Yang Hao lying on a hospital bed in Changsha in central China's Hunan province after he was diagnosed with heatstroke. The painful burn marks on his back were caused after he fainted and hit the scalding ground. Painful: This picture shows the horrific injuries sustained by Yang Hao after he fainted by a roadside and was badly burnt on his back whilst lying on the scalding ground during China's record-breaking heatwave. Sore: Mr Hao has been diagnosed with heatstroke after temperatures in China reached an astonishing 41C. Much of China is in the grip of a summer heatwave with temperatures reaching 42C in some parts of the country. It has been so hot that people have been seen grilling shrimp on manhole covers while there have been reports of eggs hatching without incubators and a highway billboard has mysteriously caught fire by itself. The heat wave - the worst in at least 140 years in some parts - has left dozens of people dead and pushed thermometers above 40C (104F) in at least 40 cities and counties, mostly in the south and east of the country. Authorities have declared the heat a. 'level 2' weather emergency for the first time. The category is usually. reserved for typhoons and flooding. Shrimply amazing: A child demonstrates how raw shrimp and an egg are fried in a pan on a manhole cover on a hot summer day in China's eastern province of Shandong. Outside a shopping centre in the financial hub of Shanhai, 17-year-old student Xu Sichen said: 'It is just hot - like in a food steamer.' Her friend He Jiali, also 17, complained that her mobile phone had turned into a 'grenade'. 'I'm so worried that the phone will explode while I'm using it,' she said. Extreme heat began hitting Shanghai and several eastern and southern provinces in early July and is expected to grip much of China until mid-August. At least 10 people have died of heat. stroke in the city over the past month, including a 64-year-old. Taiwanese sailor, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Shell shocked: These newly born chicks hatched from a box of eggs in Zhengzhou, Hunan province, such were the searing temperatures. Hatching: The temperatures have been ripe for incubating eggs, which have grown into fully fledged chicks. Chicken tonight: This dog shows a little too much interest in the newly hatched chicks as he licks his lips. Wu Guiyun, 50, who has a part-time job making food deliveries in Shanghai, said she has been trying to linger inside air-conditioned offices for as long as possible whenever she brings in a takeout order. She said: 'It's so hot that I can hardly breathe.' The highest temperature overall was recorded in the eastern city of Fenghua, which recorded its historic high of 42.7C (108.9F) on July 24. On Tuesday, the director of the China Meteorological Administration activated a 'level 2' emergency response to the persistent heat wave. Well watered: This gardener tends to his vegetable patch on the top of an office building in Nanchang, Jiangxi province The 1,000sqm field grows more than 10 kinds of vegetables, providing food for the staff canteen. This level requires around-the-clock staffing, the establishment of an emergency command centre and frequent briefings. Some Chinese in heat-stricken cities have been cooking shrimps, eggs and bacon in skillets placed directly on manhole covers or on pavements that have heated up to 60C (140F). In one photo displayed prominently in the China Daily newspaper, a boy tended to shrimps and an egg in a pan over a manhole cover in eastern Chinese city of Jinan. In the port city of Ningbo in Zhejiang province, glass has cracked in the heat, vehicles have self-combusted, and a highway billboard caught fire by itself, sending up black smoke in the air, according to China Central Television. The broadcaster said the heat might have shorted an electrical circuit on the billboard. In the southern province of Hunan, a housewife grabbed several eggs stored at room temperature only to find half-hatched chicks, state media reported.

I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States.

Answer a question about this article: Federations often employ the paradox of being a union of states, while still being states (or having aspects of statehood) in themselves. For example, James Madison (author of the US Constitution) wrote in Federalist Paper No. 39 that the US Constitution \\"is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...\\" This stems from the fact that states in the US maintain all sovereignty that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent. This was reaffirmed by the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reserves all powers and rights that are not delegated to the Federal Government as left to the States and to the people. What is the foundation for federalist paper no. 39?","completion":"The foundation for Federalist Paper No. 39 lies in the dual character of the United States Constitution, which combines elements of both a federal and a national government system. James Madison, one of the key architects of the US Constitution and author of this particular essay, sought to address the criticism posed by Anti-Federalists, who were concerned about the potential erosion of state sovereignty and the concentration of power in a central government. To allay these fears and to explain the unique structure of the proposed Constitution, Madison wrote Federalist Paper No. 39 to elucidate the principles of federalism and to demonstrate how the Constitution aimed to strike a balance between a unified national government and the preservation of state autonomy. The foundation of Madison's argument in this paper hinges on the distinction between a \\"federal\\" and a \\"national\\" constitution. According to Madison, a purely federal constitution is an agreement among fully sovereign states that retain their independent authority and merely delegate specific powers to a central government for the sake of efficiency and mutual benefit. A national constitution, on the other hand, refers to the creation of a single, unified government that holds supreme authority over the constituent states, nullifying their sovereignty and subjecting them to the direct control of the central government. Madison argues that the US Constitution is a unique blend of these two conceptions. It derives its authority partially from the states (federal) and partially from the people (national). He demonstrates that the Constitution is neither a purely federal nor a purely national document but rather a \\"composition of both.\\" The foundation of Federalist Paper No. 39 is primarily rooted in depicting how the Constitution delicately balances state sovereignty with the benefits of a cohesive and effective central government. Madison points to the bicameral legislative structure (the United States Congress), the presidential election process, and the ratification process for constitutional amendments as examples that showcase the varying degrees of state and popular influence. Furthermore, Madison references the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which serves to protect the residual sovereignty of the states. This amendment establishes that powers and rights not expressly delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states and the people themselves, reinforcing the principle of federalism that underpins the Constitution. In summary, the foundation for Federalist Paper No. 39 rests in the unique character of the United States Constitution, which blends elements of both federal and national systems in order to create a balanced, cohesive government that respects state sovereignty while promoting national unity and effective governance. It addresses the concerns surrounding the concentration of power and aims to clarify the principles of federalism that the Constitution embodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where does the wife of the person Leslie shoots live? ? On a moonlit, tropical night, the native workers are asleep in their outdoor barracks. A shot is heard; the door of a house opens and a man stumbles out of it, followed by a woman who calmly shoots him several more times, the last few while standing over his body. The woman is Leslie Crosbie, the wife of a British rubber plantation manager in Malaya; the man whom she shot is recognized by her manservant as Geoff Hammond, a well-regarded member of the European community. Leslie tells the servant to send for her husband Robert, who is working at one of the plantations. Her husband returns, having summoned his attorney and a British police inspector. Leslie tells them that Geoff Hammond \\"tried to make love to me\\" and that she killed him to save her honor. Leslie is placed under arrest and put in jail in Singapore to await trial for murder; that she killed a man makes such a trial inevitable, but her eventual acquittal seems a foregone conclusion, as the white community accepts her story and believes she acted heroically. Only her attorney, Howard Joyce, is rather suspicious. Howard's suspicions seem justified when his clerk, Ong Chi Seng, shows him a copy of a letter Leslie wrote to Hammond the day she killed him, telling him that her husband would be away that evening, and pleading with him to come—implicitly threatening him if he did not come. Ong Chi Seng tells Howard that the original letter is in the possession of Hammond's widow, a Eurasian woman who lives in the Chinese quarter of town. The letter is for sale, and Ong himself, whom Howard had believed to be impeccable, stands to receive a substantial cut of the price. Howard then confronts Leslie with the damning evidence and she breaks down and confesses to having written it, though she stands by her claim of having killed Hammond in self-defence. Yet Leslie cleverly manipulates the attorney into agreeing to buy back the letter, even though in doing so he will risk his own freedom and career. The answer is:","completion":"The wife of the person Leslie shoots, Geoff Hammond, lives in the Chinese quarter of town. Hammond's widow is a Eurasian woman who possesses the original letter that reveals crucial information about the incident between Leslie and her husband."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1998 Michigan gubernatorial election was held on November 3, 1998, to elect the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the state of Michigan. Incumbent Governor John Engler, a member of the Republican Party, was re-elected over Democratic Party nominee Geoffrey Fieger, a lawyer who had represented the assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Michigan gubernational election was biased in their votes.","completion":"To analyze whether the 1998 Michigan gubernatorial election was biased in their votes, we need to examine the context, electoral process, and factors that contributed to the results, rather than just the outcome of Republican incumbent Governor John Engler's victory over Democratic Party nominee Geoffrey Fieger. 1. Context: John Engler, a Republican, was running for his third term as Governor of Michigan. Engler had a solid record of accomplishments, including tax cuts, welfare reform, and education initiatives, which contributed to his popularity and probably had a significant impact on his electoral support. Prior to the 1998 election, Engler was already serving as the Governor after winning the elections in 1990 and 1994. His experience and familiarity with the role gave him an advantage over his opponent. 2. Candidates: Geoffrey Fieger, a lawyer, was the Democratic candidate for governor. He was best known for representing the assisted suicide advocate, Dr. Jack Kevorkian. As a result, Fieger's candidacy was strongly tied to a single controversial issue (assisted suicide), making it difficult for him to broaden his appeal to voters with diverse concerns. Also, Fieger was relatively new to politics, which may have affected his campaign's effectiveness in reaching out to and mobilizing voters. 3. Electoral process: The electoral process itself in Michigan is structured to ensure fairness. The state follows a secret ballot system, and a well-established voting procedure is in place to minimize voter fraud and irregularities. The responsibility of administering elections in Michigan lies with the Secretary of State's Office, which is tasked with ensuring that all voters have access to free, fair, and secure elections. 4. Campaign and external factors: Both candidates conducted campaigns to present their platforms to voters and garner support. Democratic candidate Geoffrey Fieger focused on issues related to healthcare, education, and his opposition to Engler's administration. Republican Governor John Engler emphasized his successful initiatives in improving education, cutting taxes, and welfare reform. While these factors may have influenced voters' choices, they do not necessarily indicate bias in the electoral process. In summary, while the outcome of the 1998 Michigan gubernatorial election, with incumbent Governor John Engler winning a third term over Democratic nominee Geoffrey Fieger, might seem one-sided, it is essential to consider the context, electoral process, and factors influencing the outcome to make any conclusions regarding bias. There is no clear evidence to suggest that the Michigan gubernatorial election was biased in the votes themselves, as a combination of candidate backgrounds, policy stances, and past achievements likely contributed to the election results."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. 31% of under-30s plot themselves as something other than exclusively heterosexual on the seven point 'Kinsey Scale' Invented by Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s, the Kinsey scale plots individuals on a range of sexual dispositions from exclusively heterosexual at 0 through to exclusively homosexual at 6. Following on from a similar study in the UK, YouGov asked people to place themselves on the sexuality scale. Overall 78% of Americans say that they are completely heterosexual while 4% say that they are completely homosexual. 16% of American adults say that they fall somewhere in between. In this group the bulk (10%) say that they are more heterosexual than homosexual while 3% put themselves in the middle and another 3% say that they are predominantly homosexual. Younger Americans are noticeably less likely than their elders to put themselves in a firm category. While 80% of all Americans say that they are completely heterosexual or homosexual only 66% of under-30s say the same. 29% of under-30s put themselves somewhere on the category of bisexuality. The older someone is the less likely they are to say that they have fluid sexual attractions. 24% of people aged 30 to 44 say that they're somewhere on the scale of bisexuality, compared to 8% or less of over-45s. A large number of Americans who classify themselves as heterosexual still admit to having had same sex experiences. 12% of heterosexual American adults say that they have had a sexual experience with someone of the same sex. Straight women (15%) are almost twice as likely as straight men (8%) to say that they have had a sexual encounter with someone of the same sex. A similar study in the UK found that young Britons were even more likely to be sexually flexible than young Americans. Nearly half of Britons under the age of 25 say that they are some level of bisexual. Full poll results can be found here and topline results and margin of error here. ||||| Asked to plot themselves on a 'sexuality scale', 23% of British people choose something other than 100% heterosexual – and the figure rises to 49% among 18-24 year olds Invented by Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s, the Kinsey scale plots individuals on a range of sexual dispositions from exclusively heterosexual at 0 through to exclusively homosexual at 6. Where the original study had a large number of methods for placing people, YouGov simply asked people to place themselves on the sexuality scale. Taken as a whole, 72% of the British public place themselves at the completely heterosexual end of the scale, while 4% put themselves at the completely homosexual end and 19% say they are somewhere in between – classed as bisexual in varying degrees by Kinsey. Of the people that do place themselves in this 1-5 area, the majority incline away from homosexuality – 15% are closer to the heterosexual end, 2% directly in the middle and 2% are closer to the homosexual end. With each generation, people see their sexuality as less fixed in stone. The results for 18-24 year-olds are particularly striking, as 43% place themselves in the non-binary area between 1 and 5 and 52% place themselves at one end or the other. Of these, only 46% say they are completely heterosexual and 6% as completely homosexual. People of all generations now accept the idea that sexual orientation exists along a continuum rather than a binary choice - overall 60% of heterosexuals support this idea, and 73% of homosexuals. 28% of heterosexuals believe that 'there is no middle ground – you are either heterosexual or you are not'. But what does it mean to be at 1 on the scale, and what is the difference being here or at 2? According to the research, progressing further away from 'completely heterosexual' (0) towards the midpoint (3, or 'completely bisexual') increases the chance that you have had a sexual experience with a member of the same sex. 23% of those at level 1 have had a sexual encounter with a member of the same sex, while 52% of people at level 2 have had such an experience. Clearly, these figures are not measures of active bisexuality - overall, 89% of the population describes themselves as heterosexual - but putting yourself at level 1 allows for the possibility of homosexual feelings and experiences. More than anything, it indicates an increasingly open minded approach to sexuality. In a further set of questions asking if respondents could conceivably be attracted to, have sex with or have a relationship with someone of the same sex (if the right person came along at the right time), level 1s were at least 35% more likely to say they could than level 0s. See the full poll results ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The Kinsey Scale is a way to measure a person's sexuality, from being completely heterosexual at 0 to completely homosexual at 6. When people were asked to place themselves on this scale, 31% of young people under 30 years old said they were not exclusively heterosexual (meaning they are a little bit interested in people of the same gender too). This number is higher than older age groups - only 8% or less of people above 45 years old said they were not exclusively heterosexual.

Outside, Father and Mr. Patrick next door were busy chopping firewood. Inside their own houses, Mother and Mrs. Patrick were engaged in spring cleaning. Somehow the boys had slipped away to the back lot with their kites. Now, even at the risk of having brother caught to beat carpets, they had sent him to the kitchen for more string .

Because it is so unique, seamless, and saves so much time, the “Helicopter Flycation” may be of great interest to visitors. The package basically combines accommodations in Tokyo, one of the world’s greatest tourism cities, with a private helicopter tour of iconic Mount Fuji. Likely the subject of more artistic representation than any other mountain on earth, Mt. Fuji is the idealized volcano, what a child would draw if handed a crayon and asked to depict one.It’s one of the world’s top natural wonders, yet seeing it close up usually involves an entire day trip from Tokyo, with hours of train and vehicle commute – each way. Not anymore. Famously symmetrical, Mt. Fuji is a UNESCO World Heritage Site – and likely the world’s most recognizable mountain. Mandarin guests board a Hermès Edition Eurocopter and fly from Tokyo over the shoreline of Sagami Bay and Lake Ashinoko to Mt. Fuji, enjoying close-up views of the mountain before returning. A national treasure locally known as Fuji-san, Mount Fuji is 12,380 feet high, a UNESCO world heritage site and the country’s national symbol. As an added bonus, guests get incredible eagle eye views of one of the most energetic and fascinating metropolises on earth, complete with a close-up of Tokyo’s SkyTree, the world’s tallest tower. Guests ride in style with the special Hermès edition Eurocopter. Helicopter Flycation package prices start at just under 6,500 per couple. This includes overnight lodging for two in a large Oriental Suite and the private helicopter trip to Mt. Fuji, approximately 80 minutes of flight time. The helicopter features a spacious interior and calf leather seats specially made by Hermès. The package also includes round-trip limousine transfer between the hotel and helipad, breakfast for two in the hotel, and a bottle of Ruinart Brut Rosé champagne.

Answer:","completion":"It's challenging to predict exactly how others might feel as a result of Casey dating a girl that he really loves and wants to be with, as emotions and reactions can widely differ based on people's individual personalities, experiences, and relationships with Casey and his girlfriend. However, I can provide a general overview of potential feelings that could arise in those who are close to the couple: 1. Happiness and Support: Friends and family who care about Casey and his new girlfriend may feel happy for them, wishing them the best in their relationship. They might provide emotional support, encouragement, and even celebrate their love, feeling glad that both individuals have found someone special. 2. Concern or Anxiety: Some people might feel concerned or anxious about the relationship, especially if they notice any potential issues or red flags, or if they think the couple might be rushing into things. They could be worried about the longevity and stability of the relationship or how it might affect the individuals involved. 3. Jealousy: In some cases, people might feel jealous if they had romantic interest in Casey or his girlfriend before the relationship began. Friends who were used to having much of Casey's time and attention may also feel a sense of jealousy or possessiveness as he becomes more invested in his new relationship. 4. Disapproval: It is also possible that some people might disapprove of the relationship, possibly due to personal beliefs, prejudices, or aversions to either Casey or his girlfriend. Disapproval might stem from factors such as cultural differences, past experiences, or even misconceptions about the people involved. 5. Indifference: Some people may not feel strongly about the relationship in any particular way. They could be indifferent to the relationship, as long as it does not directly affect them or disrupt their own lives.

Question 1: Do you agree if two events are mutually exclusive then these two events will be independent? Question 2: What is the difference between mutually exclusive events and independent events? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let's address Question 1: Task: Determine if two mutually exclusive events are also independent events. 1. Define mutually exclusive events: Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot both occur at the same time. In other words, if one event occurs, the other event cannot occur. 2. Define independent events: Independent events are events that do not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other event. In other words, the occurrence of one event does not influence the occurrence of the other event. 3. Compare the definitions: Mutually exclusive events have a constraint that if one occurs, the other cannot, whereas independent events do not have any such constraint. Instead, independent events only require that the occurrence of one event does not influence the occurrence of the other event. 4. Determine the relationship between mutually exclusive events and independent events: Since mutually exclusive events have a constraint that prevents both from occurring simultaneously, this implies that the occurrence of one event does affect the probability of the other event. Therefore, two mutually exclusive events cannot be independent events. Conclusion: I do not agree that if two events are mutually exclusive, then these two events will be independent. Now, let's address Question 2: Task: Explain the difference between mutually exclusive events and independent events. 1. Define mutually exclusive events: As mentioned before, mutually exclusive events are events that cannot both occur at the same time. If one event occurs, the other event cannot occur. 2. Define independent events: As mentioned before, independent events are events that do not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other event. The occurrence of one event does not influence the occurrence of the other event. 3. Identify the differences: The key difference between mutually exclusive events and independent events lies in the relationship between the two events. For mutually exclusive events, there is a constraint that prevents both from occurring simultaneously, whereas for independent events, there is no such constraint. Question analysis: Task: Compare whether Questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. 1. Analyze Question 1: Question 1 asks for the agreement of a statement, that is, whether two mutually exclusive events are independent events. 2. Analyze Question 2: Question 2 asks for the difference between mutually exclusive events and independent events, not considering any particular scenario. 3. Compare the questions: While both questions explore the relationship between mutually exclusive events and independent events, Question 1 asks for the validity of a specific statement, whereas Question 2 seeks a general comparison between the two types of events. Conclusion: Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing, as one inquires about a specific statement's validity and the other seeks a general comparison."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, Fianna Fáil's Niall Collins argued Congressman Peter King, who is a strong supporter of the travel ban, was \\"a close personal ally\\" of Mr Adams. He added Mr King had been a \\"major fundraiser\\" for Sinn Féin for 30 years. In an interview for Fox News, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani identified Congressman King as a fellow member of a commission which designed the immigration ban. Mr Giuliani said the commission framed the ban in terms of countries which presented a danger to the USA, rather than a measure based on religion. Since then Congressman King has claimed that Mr Giuliani was mistaken and that he was not on the commission which advised President Trump. However, the New York congressman said he does support the immigration ban, which Mr Adams has described as \\"arbitrary\\" and \\"counterproductive\\". In December, Congressman King suggested the Trump administration should consider a Federal Muslim surveillance programme. Since the 1980s, Congressman King was a vocal supporter of both Sinn Féin and the IRA, which he used to describe as a \\"legitimate force\\". In the wake of the 9/11 attacks on his home city in 2001, Congressman King became an advocate of uncompromising counter-terrorist policies and often spoke about his fears that Muslims within the USA might become radicalised. He has rejected allegations of double standards, maintaining that by the 1990s he was \\"one of the people who brought about peace in Ireland.\\" Questioned about Congressman King's views, Sinn Féin's John O'Dowd told the BBC the party agreed with him that Ireland should be an independent state \\"but we disagree on this issue and other issues\\". Mr Giuliani also has links to Northern Ireland's Troubles, but they are more legal than political. In the 1980s he was the US Attorney General in charge of efforts to extradite a high-profile IRA prison escapee, Joe Doherty, from New York back to Belfast. Joe Doherty spent nine years in jail in the USA before his extradition in 1992 - he was later freed under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Fianna Fáil has asked Sinn Féin to clarify whether they have received donations from Congressman King or President Trump. As a leading New York businessman, Donald Trump attended a Sinn Féin fundraising dinner in the city in March 1995, the year before the Provisional IRA ended its ceasefire with a major bombing in London's Docklands. Mr O'Dowd told the BBC it was his understanding that Mr Trump has never contributed to the party.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: Avoid signing with your initials or a monogram or people may not be able to identify you as the artist. Even if some people recognize your initials or monogram now, other people might not, and your painting could eventually become unidentifiable if your full or last name isn't on it. If people can’t read your signature, they won’t be able to identify you as the artist. It's true that some famous artists have illegible signatures, but they can get away with it because a lot of people in the art world are familiar with them. If your signature is illegible, future owners of your painting will have a hard time finding out who you are. Practice signing a legible signature on a piece of paper. Then, show a few friends and ask if they can read it. If they can’t, work on making it easier to read. That way people will start to recognize your signature overtime, which will make your artwork easier to identify. If your signature is always different, people might not realize your paintings were made by the same artist. If you don’t like the signature you’ve used in the past, come up with a new one now and use it on all your future paintings. A signature that is too bold can take away from the rest of your painting. Your signature should be noticeable enough that people looking for it can find it, but not so noticeable that it’s the first thing people’s eyes are drawn to. An easy way to make your signature blend in is to paint it using a color that appears a lot in your painting.","completion":"When signing your artwork, avoid using initials or monograms as this may make it difficult for people to identify you as the artist. Practice a legible signature, ensuring it is consistent across all your paintings. While your signature should be noticeable, avoid making it too bold to prevent distracting from the artwork. Utilize a color that is present in the painting to help your signature blend in, ensuring both recognition and appeal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Original statement: \\"In a city, in front of a subway, a man skateboards down a stairway as two older ladies sitting on a bench watch him.\\" 1. Location: The event takes place in a city, in front of a subway. This information provides a setting for the scenario but does not impact the logical conclusion. 2. Action: A man is skateboarding down a stairway. This is the primary action to be considered in determining whether the conclusion is accurate. 3. Observers: Two older ladies are sitting on a bench and watching the man perform his action. The presence of these onlookers is important since they are the ones the conclusion refers to as \\"two women.\\" Now, let's analyze the conclusion: \\"A man skateboards down a stairway in front of two women.\\" The conclusion focuses on two essential aspects: 1. The action: A man is skateboarding down a stairway. This action aligns perfectly with the original statement. 2. In front of two women: This statement refers to the presence of onlookers in the original statement. It is important to note that the difference in the descriptors used to identify the women does not change the logical conclusion. In the original statement, they are described as \\"two older ladies,\\" while in the conclusion, they are referred to as \\"two women.\\" Given that \\"older ladies\\" fall under the broader term \\"women,\\" this rephrasing is still correct.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I recall just one case of its kind. In my first year out of high school in college, I didn’t quite get along with one vocal pipsqueak of a guy. Mid-year one afternoon post-dismissal, a small white car drove past dangerously close to me and honked as I made my way to the bus stand home. If there had actually been any malice intended, I would have been caught out totally by surprise. The next day, he wondered aloud why I did not respond or react to him flippantly wanting to ram me with his car as he drove by. To think of it, I had already taken a swipe at another guy whom I suspected of being behind the wheel less than an hour earlier. Professing some half-hearted disinterest, I thought and felt to myself that this episode wasn’t over - yet. Fast forward some 45–60 days later, this guy is suddenly absent from college for almost a week. Successive class lecturers note that it is not like him to skip classes without a valid reason. Late on the second day of absence, another lecturer asks our class about him. “His car crashed.”, I state almost flippantly, with a weak spirit of retribution shining inside my gut. But as you would realize from answering this question it later turned out to be true. While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights. The van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks.

A:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light, and I will explain the reasons behind this conclusion in detail. Firstly, the customer mentions that they had to pay for the installation at a cost that was twice the price of the product itself. This implies that the installation process might be challenging, which could potentially be a significant drawback for potential buyers who are looking for a simple and convenient product. Secondly, the reviewer raises a concern about the product's functionality, specifically regarding rolling down the windows. The fact that they had to press the button multiple times to achieve the desired result indicates that the product might not be as user-friendly or efficient as it should be. This can be considered a significant issue, as user experience and performance play a pivotal role in a customer's overall satisfaction with a product. Moreover, the review does not mention any positive aspects of the product, such as the benefits it may have offered or any pleasant experiences the customer may have had. The absence of positive commentary leaves potential buyers with a negative impression of the product in question. Additionally, the reviewer specifically points out the negative aspects of their experience with both the product and the installation process, so readers will most likely perceive it as a reliable account of the product's shortcomings. This, in turn, may discourage potential buyers from giving the product a chance, as they would be more inclined to trust the opinion of someone who has already used the product and faced issues with it. In conclusion, this review sheds an unflattering light on the product due to the various issues discussed by the customer. The challenges faced during the installation, coupled with the poor user experience and lack of positive commentary, paint an unfavorable picture of the product and its overall usefulness. As such, the review would likely deter potential buyers from purchasing the product in question."},{"prompt":"Given the following passage \\"Martin Luther, a German monk, started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31, 1517.

They're looking for something deeper and more fulfilling, but they keep ending up in superficial, short-lived relationships. Step 3: Set up the platform for their meeting Sarah hears about an unconventional dating app from her friends, which focuses primarily on connecting people based on physical compatibility. Curious and slightly desperate, she decides to give it a try. Meanwhile, Jason's friends also persuade him to try out the same app, thinking it could be a fun way to meet new people. Step 4: Create tension and anticipation The app's algorithm matches Sarah and Jason based on their high sexual compatibility scores, and they decide to meet up at a trendy but intimate bar for a casual date. As they get to know each other, they feel an immediate and intense attraction, but both are hesitant to act on it, fearing it might lead to yet another disappointing relationship.

Write an article using the following points: Malawi authorities split up gay couple jailed last week, activists say. Unclear why Steven Mojenza was moved to different facility. Couple was sentenced last week after getting engaged.","completion":"Title: Malawi Authorities Reportedly Split Up Jailed Gay Couple, Raising Concerns Among Activists Introduction: Activists have raised concerns after it was reported that Malawi authorities have separated a gay couple who were jailed just last week. Steven Mojenza and his partner were arrested and sentenced after announcing their engagement. While the exact reasons for their separation remain unclear, human rights activists are concerned about the potential injustice and discriminatory practices at play. Malawi Gay Couple Arrested and Jailed: The recent incident began when Steven Mojenza and his partner decided to publicly announce their engagement to one another. Unfortunately, despite the milestone event in their relationship, the couple found themselves being arrested by the Malawi authorities, who criminalized their union. Their subsequent sentencing last week has highlighted the ongoing struggles faced by the LGBTQ+ community in the African country. Unclear Reasons for the Couple's Separation: After being jailed, the couple was reportedly split up by the Malawi authorities – a decision that has raised questions and concerns among local and international activists. Steven Mojenza was moved to a different facility, with no clear explanation given as to why this decision was made. Such a move isolates them further, causing additional distress and suffering. Activists Speak Out on the Incident: Human rights advocates and LGBTQ+ organizations are alarmed by the Malawi authorities' treatment of the jailed couple. They fear that this separation could be a reflection of the deeply ingrained discrimination against gay individuals in Malawi. Activists are calling for an investigation into the matter and urging the authorities to reconsider their decision and reunite Steven Mojenza and his partner. The Struggle for Gay Rights in Malawi: Malawi, like many African countries, has a long history of discriminatory practices and legislation against LGBTQ+ people. Homosexual acts are illegal in the country and are punishable with prison sentences, creating an environment where gay individuals face significant challenges in exercising their basic human rights. This recent incident has once again brought the issue of gay rights in Malawi to the forefront and emphasized the desperate need for change. International Reaction and Support: The global community has not remained silent on the matter – human rights organizations, governments, and individuals worldwide have condemned the actions of the Malawi authorities. They argue that the separation of the jailed couple represents a clear violation of their human rights and that the Malawi government must take steps to reverse this decision and protect its LGBTQ+ citizens. Conclusion: The startling incident involving Steven Mojenza and his partner highlights the ongoing struggle for gay rights and acceptance in Malawi. The decision to separate the jailed couple, without any clear rationale provided, has raised serious concerns among human rights activists. As calls for action and change grow louder, it is hoped that the Malawi authorities will recognize the need to protect its LGBTQ+ citizens and foster a more inclusive and accepting society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The \\"i do now!\\" response might suggest that the person has gained new knowledge or experiences after engaging with Cristal's content. The inclusion of an exclamation point highlights excitement and a sense of eagerness or enthusiasm on the part of the user.

Are gay people attracted by their own bodies? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"While these two questions may seem similar, they are actually inquiring about two distinct aspects of attraction and arousal in homosexual individuals. 1. Do homosexual people get aroused by their own body? Arousal is a complex physiological and psychological process, influenced by factors such as physical attraction, emotional connection, and various personal preferences. It is essential to remember that people, regardless of their sexual orientation, have diverse and individual experiences with arousal. Generally, people - whether heterosexual or homosexual - do not get aroused by their own body. Arousal typically occurs when an individual is attracted to someone other than themselves. However, one's perception of their own body and their level of self-confidence can impact how they experience and respond to arousal. For example, feeling comfortable and confident in one's own skin can lead to a more positive and fulfilling sexual experience with a partner. Autoeroticism, which is sexual self-stimulation or self-arousal, is a natural part of human sexuality and can be experienced by people of any sexual orientation. This, however, is not the same as being attracted to one's own body, as autoerotic behavior is more focused on the sensations and pleasure generated by self-stimulation rather than the physical attraction to one's own body. 2. Are gay people attracted by their own bodies? As previously mentioned, sexual attraction generally occurs between individuals, rather than within an individual towards their own body. However, people of any sexual orientation, including homosexual individuals, can appreciate and admire the human form. They can recognize and appreciate the physical attractiveness of their own body and strive for self-improvement and self-confidence, without necessarily experiencing sexual attraction toward themselves. Just as heterosexual individuals are typically not attracted to their own bodies but can appreciate and admire the opposite sex's bodies, homosexual people are generally attracted to people of the same sex but not necessarily to their own body. In both cases, the appreciation and admiration for physical attractiveness do not automatically imply sexual attraction. In conclusion, the two questions inquire about distinct aspects of homosexuality, with the first one exploring the experience of arousal and the second one focusing on physical attraction. While there is no single answer to these questions that applies to everyone due to individual variability, the general response is that homosexual people do not get aroused by their own bodies, and they are typically not sexually attracted to their own bodies. However, they can certainly appreciate and admire their own physique, just as any individual, regardless of their sexual orientation, can."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - La Mancha is a natural and historical region located on an arid but fertile, elevated plateau (610 m or 2000 ft.) of central Spain, south of Madrid, from the mountains of Toledo to the western spurs of the hills of Cuenca, and bordered to the South by the Sierra Morena and to the North by the Alcarria region. La Mancha includes portions of the modern provinces of Cuenca, Toledo, and Albacete, and most of the Ciudad Real province. La Mancha historical comarca constitutes the southern portion of CastillaLa Mancha autonomous community and makes up most of the present-day administrative region. - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\"). - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Ciudad Real (English: \\"Royal City\\") is a city in CastileLa Mancha, Spain, with a population of c. 75,000. It is the capital of the province of Ciudad Real. It has a stop on the AVE high-speed rail line and has begun to grow as a long-distance commuter suburb of Madrid, which is located 115 miles (185 km) to the north of Ciudad Real. - A comarca (, pl. \\"comarcas\\" pl. \\"comarques\\") is a traditional region or local administrative division found in parts of Spain, Portugal, Panama, Nicaragua, and Brazil. The term is derived from the term marca, meaning a \\"march, mark\\", plus the prefix \\"co\\"- meaning \\"together, jointly\\". - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - A natural region is a basic geographic unit. Usually it is a region which is distinguished by its common natural features of geography, geology, and climate. - The province of Ciudad Real is a province in the southwestern part of the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is bordered by the provinces of Cuenca, Albacete, Jaén, Córdoba, Badajoz, and Toledo. It is partly located in the old natural region of La Mancha. Its capital is Ciudad Real. It is the third biggest province of Spain, after Cáceres and Badajoz. The historical comarca Campo de Calatrava is located in the centre of the province. - Villanueva de los Infantes is a municipality in the province of Ciudad Real , Castile - La Mancha , Spain .

Answer the following question: What is the name of the person to whom Bartok dedicated the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928? Answer the above question based on the context below: Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would... Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided context, the name of the person to whom Bartok dedicated the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928 is Joseph Szigeti."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which player threw more yards in touchdown passes, Jay Cutler or Carson Palmer?","completion":"Title: Jay Cutler vs. Carson Palmer: Who Threw More Yards in Touchdown Passes? Hey kids, today we are going to talk about two football players - Jay Cutler and Carson Palmer. They both played as quarterbacks, which means they threw the football to help their teams score points. People want to know who threw more yards in touchdown passes. That's when the quarterback throws the ball and someone on their team catches it in the special scoring area called the end zone. So let's take a look at each player and count how many yards they threw in touchdown passes during their career. This will be exciting! First up is Jay Cutler. He played for 12 seasons in the NFL (National Football League). Jay was known for his big arm, which helped him throw the ball really far down the field. When he retired from football, he had thrown for 35,133 yards with 227 touchdown passes. That's a lot of yards, like throwing the ball from one end of the field almost 700 times! Now let's talk about Carson Palmer. He played in the NFL for 15 seasons, that's three years more than Jay! Carson was a great leader on the field, and he was very good at throwing the football too. By the time he retired, he threw for 46,247 yards with 294 touchdown passes. Wow, that's even more than Jay Cutler! So if we compare the numbers, we can clearly see that Carson Palmer threw more yards in touchdown passes than Jay Cutler. Great job, Carson! And both players should be proud of their accomplishments on the field because they worked really hard and made lots of fans happy. In summary, Carson Palmer threw more yards in touchdown passes than Jay Cutler. But remember, kids, football is a team sport, and both players had lots of help from their teammates to make all those great plays happen. So always cheer for your favorite team and enjoy the game!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

All baby formulas are regulated and, in general, every baby formula contains basically the same combination of protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, and minerals, which closely mimic that of human breast milk. The difference between the formulas is the sources of the proteins and carbohydrates that are used. There can also be some variation in the sources of the other main components. Some parents may prefer not to feed their baby a formula that has a particular nutrient source, such as corn syrup, while others have no problem with it. Since the nutritional value is basically the same for all formulas, knowing about nutrient sources is a useful way to differentiate between baby formulas. Breast milk and formulas made from cow's milk have the same main carbohydrate, which is lactose. However, there are lactose-free and soy formulas for babies that are lactose intolerant or being raised as vegans. These, and other specialty formulas, contain various types of carbohydrates that might include sucrose, modified corn starch, corn maltodextrin, or corn syrup solids. Most formulas have cow's milk as a base and whey and casein are their proteins, but some other formulas are made from plant proteins and have a soy base. These proteins have a soy protein isolate that is easier for some babies to digest. Soy-based formulas are often fed to babies who suffer from allergies or digestion troubles when fed formulas with a cow's milk base. Vegetable based formulas are also popular with vegans because they want to avoid products that come from animals. The ingredients in organic formulas are sourced from organic produce and organic dairy. These ingredients are obtained without the use of chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and growth hormones. Some people believe that organic ingredients are more healthy for developing babies, and limit their exposure to harmful chemicals. Probiotic formula is formula that includes good gut flora, microorganisms that are meant to promote healthy digestion and regular bowel movements. Generally, these formulas are given to babies who suffer from diarrhea or generally weak immune systems. These bacterial cultures can strengthen the body's immune response and soften stools. The regulations for baby formula are strict about the nutrients that must be in the formula in order for the baby to grow and develop properly. However, these regulations do not restrict the addition of “other ingredients”. Various brands add these ingredients for various reasons. One ingredient that is often added is various types of different nucleotides, which are supposed to help with the development of the immune system. These added ingredients are safe for the baby to consume and may help them develop, but they are more likely a way for the different brands to make their formula stand out. Summary:","completion":"Baby formulas have the same basic nutrients but can differ in their sources of proteins, carbohydrates, and other ingredients, like lactose-free or soy for special diets, organic from chemical-free sources, and probiotic for digestion; some brands add extra safe ingredients to stand out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first single from the album was \\"The Day You Come\\", a politically and socially influenced song. The band did not intend for it to be the first single, and released it only when they could not decide on anything else. Haug said it being \\"a pretty inoffensive song musically\\" helped Powderfinger make that decision. \\"The Day You Come\\" spent nine weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #25.The second single was the double a-side, \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray\\", released on 9 November 1998. \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, was one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date. 'Don't Wanna Be Left Out' could be comfortably ranked with other Powderfinger songs such as 'Lighten My Load' and 'Rise Up'. Drummer Jon Coghill described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so \\"fast and offbeat\\". The music video for \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members. \\"Good-Day Ray\\" was dedicated to Australian television presenter Ray Martin and his public disagreements with former Media Watch host Stuart Littlemore. Its lyrics verged on punk, though Coghill denied that Powderfinger were a punk band. He also described the music video for \\"Good-Day Ray\\" as being one of the better videos the band had made.Internationalist's third single was \\"Already Gone\\", released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to the Beatles and their influence on Powderfinger's music. The fourth and final single from the album was \\"Passenger\\", released on 9 August 1999. \\"Passenger\\" was influenced by Elvis Presley, and included a big horn section, as well as backing vocals from folk group Tiddas. \\"Passenger\\" won the ARIA Award for \\"Song Of The Year\\" in 1999. The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films. \\"Passenger\\" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30.

Can you tell me the answer to who wrote sitting by the dock of the bay??","completion":"\\"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\\" is a classic song written by American singer-songwriter Otis Redding, in collaboration with multi-talented guitarist and composer Steve Cropper. The song was released posthumously after Otis Redding's tragic demise in a plane crash at the age of 26 in 1967. Otis Redding, born in 1941 in Georgia, was a prominent figure in the soul and rhythm and blues music scenes during the 1960s. He began his musical career by joining bands and performing at local talent shows, eventually earning opportunities to record his music. Some of his other popular hits include \\"These Arms of Mine,\\" \\"Try a Little Tenderness,\\" and \\"Respect,\\" which was later covered and popularized by iconic singer Aretha Franklin. Steve Cropper, born in Missouri in 1941, was a founding member of Booker T. & the M.G.'s, an instrumental R&B/funk band that played as the house band for Stax Records during the 1960s. Cropper's signature guitar work can be heard on numerous hit records of that era, and he has collaborated with many well-known musicians. In the summer of 1967, Otis Redding began working on the song that would become \\"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay,\\" inspired by his stay on a houseboat in Sausalito, California. When he brought the rough draft to Stax Records, he teamed up with Steve Cropper to finish and produce the piece. Together, they crafted a soulful and introspective song that dealt with themes like longing and the passage of time. The distinct sound of seagulls and crashing waves is said to have been added by Cropper in post-production to represent the Sausalito location that inspired the song. Unfortunately, Otis Redding died in a plane crash on December 10, 1967, and the song was released on January 8, 1968, only a month after his untimely passing. The single quickly climbed the charts, ultimately becoming the first ever posthumously released song to reach the top position on the Billboard Hot 100, where it stayed for four consecutive weeks. Today, \\"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\\" is widely recognized as one of Otis Redding's most enduring and beloved contributions to the world of music, and it remains a testament to the collaborative talents of both Redding and Cropper."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery.\\", answer the following question.

What was the name of the song that was about the media frenzy that had surrounded the band for many years? Answer the above question based on the context below: Following a 31 March 2002 release on record label Eleven, Diorama reached number one on the ARIA Albums Chart on 14 April, making it Silverchair's fourth chart-topping album. It went on to be certified triple-platinum by ARIA, indicating sales in excess of 210,000 copies. The album peaked at number seven in New Zealand, thirteen in Austria, forty in Switzerland, and 116 in France. Diorama reached number ninety-one on the U.S. Billboard 200.The first single, \\"The Greatest View\\", was released in advance of the album on 28 January 2002. It reached number three in Australia, where it was also certified gold, and number four in New Zealand and Canada. It charted at number thirty-six on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2007 when re-released alongside the band's next album, Young Modern. Johns wrote \\"The Greatest View\\" as a response to the media \\"always watching [him] in different way\\". It was not intended to be aggressive, rather a straightforward commentary on the media frenzy that had surrounded the band for many years.On 13 May 2002, \\"Without You\\" was released as the second single. It peaked at number eight in Australia, but dropped to number twenty-nine the following week, only spending five weeks on the chart. The song was first announced by Silverchair bass guitarist Chris Joannou in November 1999, when he told fans the band had \\"a very small cache of recorded material stored away\\", including \\"Without You\\". \\"Without You\\" was followed by \\"Luv Your Life\\", which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release. The inspiration for the song came to Johns during a therapy session, based on the idea that \\"there were people in the world who needed treatment but couldn't afford therapy.\\" Johns composed most of the song's lyrics while listening to a therapist. In a performance at London's Shepherds Bush Empire, Johns jokingly said \\"Luv Your Life\\" was dedicated \\"to all my ladies\\".\\"After All These Years\\", a promotional single, followed \\"Luv Your Life\\", but failed to reach the charts.

Q:Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. Which brand of milk has lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland? A:","completion":"The Luchene brand of milk has a lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland. This is because, as mentioned in the information provided, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, as it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does something look like if it doesn't reflect light?\\" is \\"haze\\", given that something is black if it absorbs visible light and doesn't reflect? The answer is:","completion":"It's important to first clarify the concepts involved in this question before discussing whether \\"haze\\" is an appropriate answer. Light reflection, absorption, and transmission are essential characteristics that determine how an object interacts with light and color perception. When an object appears black, it is primarily because it is absorbing the majority of visible light incident upon it and reflecting very little. Therefore, a black object does not let much, if any, visible light reach our eyes, resulting in the perception of black. Now, let's consider the concept of \\"haze.\\" Haze is typically used as a term to describe a reduction in visibility due to the presence of suspended particles or droplets in the air. These particles can scatter and absorb light, causing the atmosphere to appear less transparent or translucent than usual. The term haze does not necessarily refer to an object itself but rather the effect that occurs when light interacts with suspended particles in the air. Haze can cause objects to become less visible, and, in extreme cases, might give an impression of something lacking color or being more difficult to see clearly. Returning to the original question: \\"What does something look like if it doesn't reflect light?\\"; the answer \\"haze\\" may not be the most appropriate as it refers to an atmospheric condition that affects the transmission and scattering of light rather than an object’s interaction with light. When an object doesn't reflect light, particularly visible light, it may appear black or completely dark, assuming no emitted light is produced. The reason for this is that there is no light being reflected back into our eyes for us to perceive any color or visual details. Additionally, if an object doesn't reflect any light in an environment where there is no ambient or non-directional light, the object may appear completely invisible since no light would interact with it. In conclusion, while \\"haze\\" does involve a change in the way light interacts with particles in the air leading to reduced visibility, it is not the most appropriate answer to the question. Rather, an object that does not reflect light may appear black or invisible depending on the lighting conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: A. riots B. wait in line C. suffer pain D. bank money E. believe in god The answer is:","completion":"B. wait in line Out of the given options, option B, \\"wait in line,\\" is the most practical and common-sense method for people to acquire the things they desire. Waiting in line demonstrates a polite and organized approach to obtaining desired items or services, as it ensures that everyone is given a fair chance to acquire what they want, based on a first-come, first-served basis. This is typically a standard practice seen in various situations, such as retail outlets, supermarkets, ticketing counters, and even government institutions. Option A, \\"riots,\\" is not a practical answer. Engaging in acts of violence or disruptive behavior to acquire desired items endangers public safety and is generally against the law. Riots can cause physical injuries, property damage, and inflict a negative impact on communities, a far cry from exercising common sense. Option C, \\"suffer pain,\\" is also not a reasonable method for obtaining what one desires. Suffering physical or emotional pain may be an outcome of striving hard for a goal, but it is not the ideal route to take when acquiring desired items or services in most situations. Intentionally suffering pain for this purpose goes against the tenets of common sense and well-being. Option D, \\"bank money,\\" is a confusing and vague response. While it is true that people use money to acquire goods and services, \\"bank money\\" isn't a clear or accessible method that gives a proper solution to the question. Option E, \\"believe in God,\\" can be a source of spiritual comfort and guidance. However, it doesn't necessarily guarantee the direct acquisition of material possessions or accomplishments. One's belief in God may provide hope and inspiration to work towards acquiring their desires, but it's not a tangible action that actively ensures a person obtains the things they are after. In conclusion, waiting in line is the most common-sense and practical option among the choices presented. It ensures a fair and orderly manner of acquiring items or services and is widely applicable to a variety of situations. Utilizing common sense and demonstrating patience and respect for others ultimately benefits everyone involved in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write highlights for this article: A fearless teenager has snapped these vertigo-inducing pictures while dangling 700ft in the air from some of London’s tallest skyscrapers. Harry Gallagher, 17, from Essex was able to dodge security to scale the likes of the ‘Walkie Talkie’, the ‘Cheesegrater’ and the unfinished London Pinnacle. The adrenaline junkie and his friends, who do not use safety equipment or harnesses, treat the scaffolds surrounding multimillion pound towers as their own urban climbing frames. Scroll down for video. Harry Gallagher and his friends (pictured his friend Johnny on a crane over Canary Wharf) have scaled dozens of London's tallest skyscrapers to capture photographs. They are part of a growing community of cityscape adventurers known as Urban Explorers and prefer to use the huge cranes bestriding buildings to capture views of the capital. Last month Mr Gallagher, who is also a free-runner, mounted a crane taller than the under-construction Baltimore Tower at the Isle of Dogs, which will be almost 500ft when it is completed. He said: ‘We’d been planning it for weeks, every little detail like what time we should arrive - we ended up at the bottom of the crane at 4am. ‘There was security there but I was still surprised how easy it was. His legs can be seen dangling as he sits on top of a huge crane overlooking London to capture a series of photographs. He is part of group known as Urban Explorers. Harry Gallagher pictured on top of St Thomas' Hospital beside The Shard, which stands at almost 1000ft and is currently the tallest building in the European Union. ‘The view was amazing. We could see all of Canary Wharf and all over the rest of London. We stayed up there for three hours but I wanted to spend the rest of the summer there.’ His death-defying stunts are similar to the ‘skywalkers’ of Russia and Ukraine who hang from the edges of buildings, but the retail assistant insists he is more interested in taking photographs. He added: ‘For skywalkers it’s about the risk, to climb towers and balance. We go up to enjoy the experience and to take photos. ‘As far as hobbies go, it’s just as dangerous as other extreme sports like motor sports, skiing or snowboarding. ‘I feel perfectly safe whenever I climb because I’ve been training for a long time. I have been free running for seven years and I think that has given me strength and, importantly, balance. Harry and his friends observe the London skyline after scaling a huge building that over looks the 'Walkie Talkie' (left) and The Shard (right) The group have been able to evade security and without any safety equipment climb massive towers in order to capture these breath-taking images of the capital. ‘When I am at the top, I’m constantly making sure my hands have got a tight grip. I don’t move until I know I am secure.’ Mr Gallagher, who also favours extinct rail lines and disused reservoirs for climbs, explained the last thing to do is to think about slipping and plummeting whilst hundreds of feet above the ground. He said: ‘I understand that I might not be setting the best example. ‘My theory is that if I can do it at 10ft I can do it at 100ft or 40 stories. But I would be lying if I said I don’t think about falling. But if you think you will fall, you will fall. The key is to think positive.’ Despite evading security in dozens of cases, not all climbs have been successful as he discovered after his first and only run in with police while climbing the frame of plush new apartments in Vauxhall, south London. One of harry's friends lies inside the cab of a crane as it overlooks London. They were arrested six months ago for attempting to climb apartments in Vauxhall. His friend Johnny is seen at the end of a crane snapping photographs overlooking Canary Wharf on a bleak misty morning in the capital. Harry says his mother refuses to look at the images they capture and is 'not happy' about his high-climbing hobby. He explained: ‘We were arrested about six months ago - within about 30 minutes of starting the climb we were in the back of a police car. ‘There were cars, a helicopter and police dogs looking for us. ‘Luckily on that occasion the charges were dropped. I found if you respect the police, they respect you.’ Mr Gallagher and his friends have seen security being tightened up in recent times but he says he isn't worried about getting caught again. 'If I'm doing it to capture pictures and not to be destructive I think the police can understand.' But the teenager’s toughest challenge has been convincing his mother to look at his impressive portfolio of photographs. He said: ‘My mum knows what I’m doing. It was almost impossible for her not to find out because I was out all night. ‘But she doesn’t want to hear about it. I can’t say she is happy about it and she doesn’t want to see any of the photos.’ Harry stands on a narrow bar of a crane to take this vertigo-inducing image. He has been free running - or leaping from tall buildings - for seven years.","completion":"1.

Question: Sally drops a bowling ball into a small wading pool, then she drops a much smaller baseball into the same wading pool. She notices that the bowling ball causes more water to splash out, this means that more water is displaced by the larger bowling ball or smaller baseball.? Text: So more water is displaced by a bigger body than a smaller one. Answer:","completion":"The displacement of water in the swimming pool is directly related to the size of the object that is being dropped into it. This phenomenon is due to a principle in physics called Archimedes' principle. Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. In this scenario mentioned, Sally drops two objects of different sizes into the same wading pool— a bowling ball, which is larger, and a baseball, which is considerably smaller. When each of these objects is dropped into the pool, they displace an amount of water equivalent to their own volume. Given this, the larger object, the bowling ball in this case, will displace a greater volume of water than the smaller object, the baseball. This is because the bowling ball has a larger volume compared to the baseball, taking up more space in the pool and thus pushing out or \\"displacing\\" a greater amount of water. The noticeable increase in water splashing out when the bowling ball is dropped as compared to when the baseball is dropped further establishes this point. The splashing is caused by the sudden displacement of water by the object, and the greater the volume of the object, the larger the water displacement, which results in a larger splash. So, in summary, based on the given text and the principles of physics, more water is displaced by the larger bowling ball than the smaller baseball."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In the middle of 1984 a Brazilian company called Prológica, which made its own versions of 8 bits US computers, brought to the Brazilian market a new equipment for its personal computer series called \\"CP\\" (shorten of Personal Computer in Portuguese). Hypothesis: Prológica violated US computer copyrights when it brought its own versions of US 8-bit computers to Brazilian markets.","completion":"From the provided context, we can generate a hypothesized argument that Prológica may have violated US computer copyrights when it brought its own versions of US 8-bit computers to the Brazilian market. However, we must acknowledge that this hypothesis is only based on the limited information available, and drawing a definite conclusion would require thorough research and analysis of existing copyright and intellectual property laws, the specific technologies used by Prológica and how they relate to the US computers in question, as well as any potential licensing or agreements made between Prológica and the original creators of the US computers. Let's break down this hypothesis into several factors that could support or debunk it for a better understanding: 1. Copyright and intellectual property laws: When investigating potential copyright violations, it is crucial to consider the laws governing such issues in both the United States and Brazil. If Prológica had manufactured exact replicas or substantially similar versions of the US computers that infringed upon specific copyrights or patents held by US companies, the hypothesis could carry merit. 2. Technological similarities: In order to warrant a violation claim, the technologies employed in Prológica's \\"CP\\" series would need to be examined closely to identify any likeness to the US computers that go beyond fundamental design aspects inherent to personal computers in general. A careful analysis could reveal whether the similarities were unintentional or rather a deliberate attempt to replicate proprietary technologies. 3. Licensing agreements: It is possible that Prológica had entered into licensing agreements with the original creators of the US computers, allowing them to legally manufacture and distribute their 8-bit personal computers in Brazil. If such an agreement was in place, then the hypothesis loses its foundation. 4. Market factors: The economic climate, consumer demand, and competitive landscape of the Brazilian market in 1984 would also offer insights into why Prológica chose to introduce its versions of US computers into the market. It may be an essential context for understanding whether their actions were driven by a desire to exploit a market opportunity or to deliberately violate existing US computer copyrights. In summary, the hypothesis that Prológica violated US computer copyrights when it brought its own versions of US 8-bit computers to the Brazilian market is an interesting proposition that warrants further investigation. To validate or debunk this hypothesis, a detailed examination of the factors listed above, as well as any additional information relevant to the situation, should be conducted."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Many planners and advisors require that their clients have an investment portfolio of at least a minimum value, sometimes 100,000 or more. This means it could be hard to find an advisor willing to work with you if your portfolio isn't well established. In that case, look for an advisor interested in helping smaller investors. How do financial planners help? Planners are professionals whose job is to invest your money for you, ensure that your money is safe, and guide you in your financial decisions. They draw from a wealth of experience at allocating resources. Most importantly, they have a financial stake in your success: the more money you make under their tutelage, the more money they make. The herd instinct, alluded to earlier, is the idea that just because a lot of other people are doing something, you should, too. Many successful investors have made moves that the majority thought were unwise at the time. That doesn't mean, however, that you should never seek investment advice from other people. Just be wise about choosing the people you listen to. Friends or family members with a successful background in investing can offer worthwhile advice, as can professional advisors who charge a flat fee (rather than a commission) for their help. Invest in smart opportunities when other people are scared. In 2008 as the housing crisis hit, the stock market shed thousands of points in a matter of months. A smart investor who bought stocks as the market bottomed out enjoyed a strong return when stocks rebounded. This reminds us to buy low and sell high. It takes courage to buy investments when they are becoming cheaper (in a falling market) and sell those investments when they are looking better and better (a rising market). It seems counter-intuitive, but it's how the world's most successful investors made their money. Your life and conditions in the market change all the time, so your investment strategy should change with them. Never be so committed to a stock or bond that you can't see it for what it's worth. While money and prestige may be important, never lose track of the truly important, non-material things in life: your family, friends, health, and happiness. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5d/Start-Investing-Step-23.jpg/v4-460px-Start-Investing-Step-23.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/5/5d/Start-Investing-Step-23.jpg/aid1319046-v4-728px-Start-Investing-Step-23.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} For example, if you are very young and saving for retirement, it may be appropriate to have most of your portfolio invested in stocks or stock funds. This is because you would have a longer time horizon in which to recover from any big market crashes or declines, and you would be able to benefit from the long-term trend of markets moving higher. If you are just about to retire, however, having much less of your portfolio in stocks, and a large portion in bonds and/or cash equivalents is wise. This is because you will need the money in the short-term, and as a result you do not want to risk losing the money in a stock market crash right before you need it.

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which company was second leading in the market in August of 1997?","completion":"Title: Which Company Was Second Best in August 1997? Hello, little friends! In this article, we are going to find out which company was second best in the market in August of 1997. It was a long time ago, so we will try to make this journey fun and exciting for you! In the year 1997, many companies were trying to become number one. It's like a race where everyone wants to run the fastest and win the prize. The business world is like a big game, and the companies are the players. One of the most successful companies at that time was Apple. You probably know Apple, right? They make the iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks that many people use today. But in 1997, Apple was not yet as big as it is today. So, they were not the number one company. Now, let's find out who was the second-best company in August 1997. To know that, we need to look at a list called the 'stock market.' This list tells us how well companies are doing by looking at how much their special papers, called 'stocks,' are worth. The more the stocks are worth, the better the company is doing in the game! So, in August 1997, the company that was second best in the market was called Microsoft. Yes, that's the company that makes Windows, which is what many computers use to work. Microsoft was like the 'runner-up' in the game, almost winning the race. Microsoft is a very important company even today, helping many people use computers, play games, and do work-related stuff. In August 1997, they were second-best, but they kept working hard, and they are still a significant player in the big game of business. I hope you enjoyed knowing about the company that was second best in the market in August 1997. Remember, life is a race, and sometimes coming second teaches us important lessons to become better and stronger!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the given equation 14417 = 1455*y + 62432 for y, we need to isolate the variable y. Here's a step-by-step process: Step 1: Subtract 62432 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with y on one side of the equation. 14417 - 62432 = 1455*y Step 2: Calculate the result on the left side of the equation -48015 = 1455*y Step 3: Now, to solve for y, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1455. -48015 / 1455 = y Step 4: Calculate the result on the left side of the equation. y ≈ -33 So, the approximate value of y in the given equation is -33."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

London (CNN) -- If you want to make a phone call you will have to find a big red box on the street -- that's if you're prepared to brave the occasional dense smogs that afflict London. Or you could instead curl up on the sofa with a hot drink and watch the only channel on television; as long as you haven't already used your tea ration for the week and your family is one of the few that has a TV set. Anyone taking a ride in a time machine back to the London of 1952 when Queen Elizabeth II came to the throne would find a dramatically different country to the UK's modern capital. The OPTIONS: - Agatha Christie's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - CNN's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - London's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - Queen Elizabeth II's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - St. Martin's Theatre's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - The Mousetrap's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. - UK's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work.","completion":"London of the 1950s was a time of post-war frugality, contrasts, and change. Fast forward to today, and the city has come a long way in terms of progress, technology, and economic development. One aspect of this transformation can be seen in the wages of the people. The UK's minimum wage is currently set at about £240 (369) a week for 40 hours' work. The rise in salaries and improved working conditions is just one example of how the quality of life in London has changed since Queen Elizabeth II's ascension to the throne. In the 1950s, London was still recovering from the devastation of World War II. Many families were living in inadequate housing, rationing was still a reality for some goods, and the economic downturn continued to impact the job market. In comparison, the modern city has grown into a prosperous metropolis, recognized as one of the world's leading financial and cultural centers. The introduction of the minimum wage has had a significant impact on the lives of workers in the UK. Established in 1998, the minimum wage has provided a basic level of income for those working in low-paying jobs, ensuring that they can meet their daily living expenses. This has contributed to a reduction in income inequality and has helped to lift many people out of poverty. Technological advancements have also played a significant role in transforming London since the 1950s. The prominence of communication technology, such as mobile phones and the internet, has made staying connected with friends, family, and professional contacts easier and more efficient. This widespread use of technology has enhanced productivity, entertainment, and learning opportunities throughout the city and beyond. The evolution of healthcare in London is another area that has seen considerable progress. While the National Health Service (NHS) was established in 1948, the quality and range of healthcare services have expanded significantly since the 1950s. The UK now enjoys one of the most advanced healthcare systems in the world, with a heavy focus on preventative measures and improved access to healthcare for all citizens. Overall, London has transformed substantially since Queen Elizabeth II came to the throne in 1952. The city has emerged from the challenges of post-war recovery to become a thriving global capital, with advancements in wages, technology, healthcare, and more. Comparing the city's past to its present reveals a remarkable journey of progress, demonstrating the resilience and innovation of its people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: John William Money (8 July 1921 - 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of \\"gender\\" affect an individual. More recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide. Money's writing has been translated into many languages, and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. In this book (Oxford 1988: 116), Money develops a conception of 'bodymind,' as a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between nature versus nurture, innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological. He suggests that all of these capitalize on the ancient, pre-Platonic, pre-biblical conception of body versus the mind, and the physical versus the spiritual. In coining the term \\"bodymind\\", in this sense, Money wishes to move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology. Money also develops here (Oxford 1988: 114-119) a view of \\"Concepts of Determinism,\\" which, transcultural, transhistorical, and universal, all people have in common, sexologically or otherwise. These include pairbondage, troopbondage, abidance, ycleptance, foredoomance, with these coping strategies: adhibition (engagement), inhibition, explication. Money suggests that the concept of threshold (Oxford 1988: 115) - the release or inhibition of sexual (or other) behavior - is most useful for sex research as a substitute for any concept of motivation. Moreover, it confers the distinct advantage of having continuity and unity to what would otherwise be a highly disparate and varied field of research. It also allows for the classification of sexual behavior. For Money, the concept of threshold has great value because of the wide spectrum to which it applies. \\"It allows one to think developmentally or longitudinally, in terms of stages or experiences that are programmed serially, or hierarchically, or cybernetically (i.e. regulated by mutual feedback).\\" (Oxford 1988: 116) Does the book detail any other important topics?","completion":"Yes, the book also talks about something called \\"Concepts of Determinism.\\" It includes things that all people have in common, no matter where they're from or what time they live in. These things can help us understand how people think and behave. The book also talks about the idea of \\"threshold,\\" which is helpful for researchers who study how and why people do certain things, including how they act in relationships. This way of thinking helps make studying people's behaviors more organized and easier to understand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend. After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun.

Salustios Emesalainen Translate this to English?","completion":"Salustios Emesalainen appears to be a name, and since names typically don't have direct translations, some context is needed to provide a detailed and long answer. However, we can analyze the two components of this name: 1. Salustios: This might be a variation of the name \\"Salustius,\\" which is a Latin name. It is derived from the Roman cognomen \\"Sallustius\\". Sallustius is a name often associated with the Roman historian and politician Gaius Sallustius Crispus, known simply as Sallust. He was known for his works on the history of Rome, primarily focused on the fall of the Roman Republic. In English, the name would still be rendered as \\"Salustios\\" or \\"Sallustius\\", maintaining its Latin origin. 2. Emesalainen: This part of the name appears to have Finnish roots. \\"Emesalainen\\" could be a last name derived from the word \\"Emesa\\" and the Finnish suffix \\"-lainen\\", which usually denotes an association with a place, in this case, Emesa. Therefore, Emesalainen might mean \\"person from Emesa.\\" It's worth mentioning that Emesa was an ancient city in the Roman province of Syria; this city is now known as Homs in modern-day Syria. So, Salustios Emesalainen could be assumed to be a name referring to a person with Latin and Finnish connections, possibly meaning \\"Salustios from Emesa.\\" Like any name, the meaning can vary depending on cultural and historical context, but this analysis provides an approximate understanding of the name in English."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is likely that the subject being referred to is the American jazz pianist and vibraphonist, Gary Burton. Here's a thorough analysis of how this conclusion was reached: 1. Instrument: The two instruments mentioned are piano and vibraphone. Gary Burton was a renowned vibraphonist and also proficient in piano playing. 2. Birth name: Although Gary Burton was not born as \\"Robert William Kirkland,\\" birth name discrepancies can sometimes be traced to the use of middle names, altered spelling, or pseudonyms. However, this remains an inconsistency and may not perfectly match with Gary Burton. 3. Death date: Gary Burton is still alive and therefore does not have a death date, which creates another inconsistency. 4. Genre: Jazz music is the mentioned genre, and Gary Burton was famous for his contributions to jazz, particularly as a pioneer of the \\"four-mallet\\" technique for vibraphone. 5. Birth date: Gary Burton was born on January 23, 1943, which is a close match to the provided birth date of January 29, 1937. Although they do not perfectly align, this similarity could result from mixing up numbers or a simple error. 6. Background: It is noted that the subject has a background as a \\"non-vocal instrumentalist,\\" and Gary Burton was primarily recognized for his instrumental skills as opposed to vocal abilities. 7. Label: The labels listed - ABC, Verve, Atlantic, and Mercury - were all associated with Gary Burton at various points throughout his career. He released multiple albums with these labels, further supporting the connection. 8. Occupation: The listed occupations of \\"musician, record producer, and songwriter\\" all align with Gary Burton's professional background.

I can use this background: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1] Now, I have a new situation: Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator. Answer this question please: Which country will feel the effects of climate change more quickly? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Iceland will likely feel the effects of climate change more quickly than Ecuador. This is due to the fact that higher latitudes, such as those closer to the poles, are expected to experience more pronounced and rapid climate change impacts. As stated in your background information, climate change effects are felt more quickly and drastically in higher latitudes, which is where Iceland is situated. The Arctic region, in particular, is warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average. This is known as Arctic amplification, caused by factors such as the decreasing ice cover, which reduces the Earth's ability to reflect sunlight back into space, and the increasing exposure of darker ocean and land surfaces, which absorb more sunlight and contribute to further warming. As a result, countries in higher latitudes like Iceland bear the brunt of the changing climate, experiencing melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, and disruption of ecosystems. In contrast, Ecuador is located near the Equator and, although not immune to climate change impacts, it might experience them at a relatively slower rate compared to Iceland. However, it is important to note that each country will face different climate change-related problems: while Iceland might see a significant loss of ice cover and rising sea levels, Ecuador could experience changes in precipitation patterns, increased risk of droughts, and threats to biodiversity. In conclusion, Iceland, being situated at a higher latitude, will likely feel the effects of climate change more quickly than Ecuador, which is located near the Equator. Each country will face distinct challenges related to climate change, and both will need to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies to address these issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And we think that’s great. Part of sexual health is learning about what feels best for you. So, in developing our TROJAN® VIBRATIONS product line, we make every effort to design products to ap... ||||| IT’S common in New York to see teams of college-age students handing out samples of goods like fruit juice and dog food. Even seen-everything New Yorkers may do a double-take this week, however, when they encounter street teams with hot dog carts stocked with vibrators. On Wednesday and Thursday, Trojan Vibrations, a line of sexual enhancement devices, will hand out 10,000 free vibrators from two hot dog carts identified as pleasure carts. Along with the brand’s logo, the carts will feature sayings like “Getcha vibes here!” and “Relish the moment.” Trojan plans to distribute 5,000 each of the Tri-Phoria device, which retails for 40, and the Pulse, which retails for 30, for a total retail value of 350,000. It goes without saying, surely, but Trojan asserts this is the biggest handout of vibrators ever. The promotion begins Wednesday morning with a live commercial by Howard Stern on his show on Sirius XM Radio. The carts will roam Manhattan for two days, with their locations updated on the Trojan Vibrations Facebook page. In what Bruce Weiss, vice president for marketing at Trojan, called “almost like a gateway product,” Trojan introduced a vibrating ring in 2005 that was included in some packages of condoms for an “improved condom experience.” The brand began selling a small vibrator, the Mini, in 2009, and the larger Tri-Phoria in 2010. The strategy throughout for Trojan, a Church & Dwight brand, has been to challenge the stigmas associated with the products. The company has advertised aggressively, even during prime time on some cable networks. In 2011, Trojan spent 10.5 million advertising its Vibrations line, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. Today, the Trojan devices are carried in retailers that were not on the radar for sex-toy shoppers a decade ago, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid. So new are the devices to mainstream retailers that growth in that channel has been phenomenal. In the 52 weeks that ended July 8, revenue for sexual enhancement devices sold in drugstores and mass retailers grew 23.2 percent over the year before, to 16.1 million, according to the Symphony IRI Group, whose totals do not include Walmart. Trojan, which accounts for 66.2 percent of the category at such retailers, grew even more over the year, by 40.2 percent. According to studies financed by Trojan and published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, 52.5 percent of women and 44.8 percent of men have used vibrators. Contrary to perceptions that they are used nearly exclusively by the unaccompanied, 40.9 percent of women and 40.5 percent of men report having used them with sexual partners. “What we’re doing is taking something like a hot dog cart that is so everyday and so mainstream,” Mr. Weiss said, “and we’re showing people that vibrators are mainstream.” Two commercials for the newest Trojan Vibrations product, Twister, which retails for 60, promote it as a spark for couples. One begins with a woman on the telephone with a friend. “All I did was mention it might be a Trojan Twister night and things totally changed,” she says, as her husband passes by first with a load of folded laundry, and then with an iron and ironing board. “Come on, lazybones, shoe sale today,” he says at one point. Later, he pats the couch beside him with one hand, the remote in the other. “Big game?” he says. “Heck no, let’s watch ‘Desperate Bride Makeovers.’ ” The campaign is by Colangelo Synergy Marketing in Darien, Conn., part of the Omnicom Group. Carol Queen, curator of the Antique Vibrator Museum and a staff sexologist for Good Vibrations, a sexual products retailer founded in 1977, credits the new Trojan ads with “pretty seamlessly integrating men into the campaign.” As both a sales strategy and to more accurately reflect how the devices are used, “a company needs to overcome this notion that vibrators are problematic for couples because men don’t like women to use them,” Ms. Queen said. Rather than seeing the growing availability of the devices at mass retailers as a threat to specialty retailers like Good Vibrations, Ms. Queen said, “what’s fabulous about the way that Trojan has entered the marketplace is that a rising tide lifts all boats.” Some consumers who buy their first device as an impulse buy at a mass retailer are apt to eventually be drawn to boutiques like Good Vibrations, which along with Trojan devices has a wide selection of other brands — and knowledgeable staff members. “Going to a sexuality store like Good Vibrations or many others, you have trained people who can answer your questions and help you choose,” Ms. Queen said. “What most customers are probably not doing is getting the greeter at Walmart to come with them to the vibrator aisle and asking them, ‘Which one should I get?’ ” Claire Cavanah, co-owner of Babeland, a sexual products shop with locations in Seattle and New York, lauded the plan by Trojan to distribute free devices. “It sounds fantastic and I’m just delighted that there is a company that has the resources and the sex-positivity to do it,” Ms. Cavanah said. At the annual BlogHer conference that began Aug. 2, Trojan Vibrations gave out 4,000 devices, meaning that the brand is on pace to give away more than 14,000 of the products in August, with a total retail value of 540,000. Mr. Weiss, of Trojan, said the brand gave out a few hundred of the devices from trucks around New York last summer, and wanted to have more impact this year. “People were clamoring for the vibrators, and we thought that by giving out more vibrators, it would have more buzz, so to speak,” Mr. Weiss said. ||||| PRINCETON, N.J., Aug. 7, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- August just got a whole lot hotter as the makers of Trojan™ Vibrations bring pleasure to the streets with a massive giveaway of 10,000 Trojan™ vibrators – the largest-ever vibrator giveaway of its kind.

As I stood there soaking in the early morning light, I was reminded of an important lesson. When I arrived in San Francisco, I told myself, \\"Just take photos as you do other things.\\" My primary goal was to meet with friends and so I figured I could take pictures as we walked around the city. This resulted in exactly zero photos worth sharing. I had vague ideas like, \\"I'd like to do some street photography,\\" but I never went out with the intent of photographing something specific. Finally, on the last morning, I went out with the intent of capturing a specific picture and I ended up with something worth sharing. My mistake was that I assumed that because I wanted to take photos, I would end up getting a desirable result. How often do you do this in your own life?

Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, later called simply Rehab with Dr. Drew, is a reality television show that aired on the cable network VH1 in which many of the episodes chronicle a group of well-known people as they are treated for alcohol and drug addiction by Dr. Drew Pinsky and his staff at the Pasadena Recovery Center in Pasadena, California. The first five seasons of the series, on which Pinsky also serves as executive producer, cast celebrities struggling with addiction, with the first season premiering on January 10, 2008, and the fifth airing in 2011. The sixth season, which filmed in early 2012, featured non-celebrities as treatment subjects, and the series name shortened to Rehab with Dr. Drew. Season 6 premiered on September 16, 2012. Sierra, Binzer, and Carey agreed to enter a transitional sober living home in the season finale. All three, as well as Laurer and Foxworth, would eventually relapse; some re-entered treatment. VH1 aired a reunion special detailing the patients' lives since filming. Although Conaway was able to maintain sobriety from alcohol and cocaine, he continued to abuse analgesics for his back pain, and would re-enter treatment in the show's second season. Binzer also appeared in several episodes of the second season for his relapses, as well as the Sober House spin-off series. Laurer was hospitalized in December 2008 and was reportedly going back to rehab. She later was found dead in her house on April 20, 2016. Nielsen and Rodriguez have reportedly maintained their sobriety. Pinsky has said on numerous occasions that Nielsen has quit drinking and also gave up smoking. Nielsen has also appeared on his radio shows to talk about her sobriety. In 2009, she appeared as a panel speaker to another group at the Pasadena Recovery Center, in which she anticipated the upcoming two-year mark of her sobriety that July, as seen in a third-season episode of the series, which aired in February 2010. Sierra has tested \\"clean and sober\\" for a year and a half following a court-ordered year of treatment at the Pasadena Recovery Center, She also appeared with Nielsen in the aforementioned third-season episode, marking her 18 months of sobriety. The status of Baldwin's sobriety is unknown. As of May 2009, Foxworth is reportedly sober and gave birth to a son. Carey relapsed and returned to porn, starring in and directing a parody film called Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw, a decision which Pinsky said saddened him. Regarding her sobriety, Pinsky commented in a January 2010 TV Guide story, \\"She puts together, like, six weeks at a time of sobriety, then drifts away. We're trying to get her to stay with it once and for all.\\" What happened to the people who releasped","completion":"Many of the individuals who relapsed after appearing on \\"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew\\" faced various challenges and consequences. Here is a summary of what happened to some of them: 1. Jessica Sierra - After relapsing, she entered a court-ordered year of treatment at the Pasadena Recovery Center. She eventually tested \\"clean and sober\\" for a year and a half. 2. Jeff Conaway - Despite maintaining sobriety from alcohol and cocaine, he continued abusing analgesics for back pain and re-entered treatment in the show's second season. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2011 from pneumonia and encephalopathy, which were related to his long-term drug use. 3. Seth Binzer - He appeared in several episodes of the second season for his relapses and the Sober House spin-off series. However, his current sobriety status is unclear. 4. Jaimee Foxworth - As of May 2009, she was reportedly sober and gave birth to a son. 5. Mary Carey - She relapsed and returned to the adult film industry, starring in and directing a parody film called \\"Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw.\\" Her sobriety has been inconsistent, with periods of six weeks of sobriety followed by drifting away from treatment. 6. Joanie Laurer (Chyna) - She was hospitalized in December 2008 and reportedly went back to rehab. Tragically, she was found dead in her house on April 20, 2016, due to an overdose of prescription drugs and alcohol. 7. Daniel Baldwin - The status of his sobriety is unknown. It is important to note that addiction recovery is a challenging and ongoing process for many individuals. Relapse is not uncommon, and it can be a part of the journey for those seeking to maintain long-term sobriety. Support from friends, family, and healthcare professionals may play a crucial role in assisting these individuals with their recovery efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Puerto Rico is designated in its constitution as the \\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\\". The Constitution of Puerto Rico which became effective in 1952 adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado (literally translated as \\"Free Associated State\\"), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic. The island is under the jurisdiction of the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which has led to doubts about the finality of the Commonwealth status for Puerto Rico. In addition, all people born in Puerto Rico become citizens of the U.S. at birth (under provisions of the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917), but citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote for president nor for full members of either house of Congress. Statehood would grant island residents full voting rights at the Federal level. The Puerto Rico Democracy Act (H.R. 2499) was approved on April 29, 2010, by the United States House of Representatives 223–169, but was not approved by the Senate before the end of the 111th Congress.

While the two questions may appear to be similar, they are not the same. Each question seeks different information about PAN cards. 1. \\"What is PAN CARD for?\\" This question specifically asks for the purpose or use of a PAN card. In response to this question, one would provide a detailed explanation of why PAN cards exist and how they are utilized. For example: A PAN (Permanent Account Number) Card is a unique, 10-character alphanumeric identifier that serves as an important identity proof and is issued to Indian citizens by the Indian Income Tax Department. The primary purpose of a PAN card is to monitor and track financial transactions subject to tax. It simplifies tax compliance for the Indian government by linking every financial transaction to a particular individual or entity, thereby combating tax evasion and encouraging transparency. 2. \\"What is a PAN card?\\" This question is more broad and asks for a general understanding or definition of a PAN card. In response to this question, one would describe what a PAN card is and briefly mention the main functions or roles it plays. For example: A PAN (Permanent Account Number) Card is an identity card issued to Indian citizens by the Indian Income Tax Department. It features a unique, 10-character alphanumeric code that simplifies tax compliance for the Indian government by linking every financial transaction to an individual or entity. PAN cards are used for a variety of financial activities, such as filing tax returns, verifying identity for bank accounts, and conducting certain transactions above a specific threshold.

What is the best way to: To prepare the colored rainbow cookie dough for cooking","completion":"Preparing the colored rainbow cookie dough for cooking can be a fun and creative activity. To make the perfect rainbow cookies, it is essential to prepare the dough correctly to achieve the vibrant colors and delicious taste. Here is a step-by-step guide on the best way to prepare colored rainbow cookie dough for cooking: 1. Gather the needed ingredients: - 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour - 1 ½ cups granulated sugar - 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature - 2 large eggs - 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract - 1 teaspoon lemon zest - 2 teaspoons baking powder - ¼ teaspoon salt - Food coloring (gel-based for best results) in a variety of rainbow colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) 2. Begin by combining the dry ingredients. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside for later use. 3. Cream the butter and sugar together. In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This should take approximately 3-4 minutes. 4. Gradually add in the wet ingredients. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, into the butter mixture. Make sure to mix well after each addition. Then, add the vanilla extract and lemon zest, mixing until they are well incorporated. 5. Slowly combine the dry and wet mixtures. Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the wet butter mixture, mixing at a low speed until the dough is combined. 6. Divide the dough evenly into separate bowls. Determine how many colors you want for your rainbow cookies. Divide the dough evenly into the same number of small bowls based on the number of colors you have chosen. For a typical rainbow, you will need seven colors and seven small bowls. 7. Add food coloring to each bowl. Using gel-based food coloring, color each portion of dough with a different color. Start with small amounts of food coloring and mix until you are satisfied with the intensity of the color. 8. Cover and chill the colored dough. Cover each bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour or until the dough is firm enough to handle. Chilling the dough will make it easier to roll and shape the cookies. 9. Prepare the cookies for baking. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 10. Shape the colored dough into small balls. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator. Take one piece from each colored dough and roll them into small, even-sized balls, approximately 1-inch in diameter. 11. Combine the colored dough balls. Gently press and roll the colored balls of dough together to form one large ball, making sure not to mix the colors too much to maintain the rainbow effect. Then, slightly flatten the ball with the palm of your hand. 12. Place the cookies on the baking sheet. Arrange the dough balls about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet as they will expand during baking. 13. Bake the cookies. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are slightly golden and the cookies are set. Remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Now your colored rainbow cookie dough is ready for cooking. Enjoy the vibrant and delicious rainbow cookies with family and friends!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Chris Pleasance. Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford has released a picture on himself taking a dip in the pool at his rehab clinic. He also announced plans to be out the clinic on June 31 so he can launch his reelection campaign on July 1 - Canada Day. Ford has been at the Greenestone facility, in Ontario, since checking himself in on May 1 after another drunken rant was caught on camera. Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto who was filmed last year smoking crack cocaine, has been picture enjoying a swim at his GreeneStone rehab clinic in Ontario. Ford said today that he plans to be back at home on July 1 when he will launch his reelection campaign (pictured at Toronto town hall in November 2013) Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.' Speaking about his time in the clinic, Ford said he has been able to work out, relax and make some friends, though confesses he has been missing his family. The only time he has seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he adds that he is anxious to get back to them. On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledges that it is his own fault. He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it. 'I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.' Ford was pictured looking glum outside the clinic last month, wearing an orange sweater, jeans and Crocs. 'I feel good. You are going to see a difference. You are going to see a healthier Rob Ford and I am going to win the election on Oct. 27.' The picture is the first time Ford has been seen inside the clinic, though last month he was pictured outside wearing. a bright orange Texas Longhorns sweater, jeans and Crocs. On that occasion, 44-year-old looked glum during the brisk stroll, despite earlier. calling the luxurious rehabilitation center 'amazing' and saying it. reminded him of 'football camp'. A week before that, he was seen in Bracebridge, which is about 25 miles east of the center. He was seen chatting with local residents, many of whom snapped pictures with him and posted them online. In a bizarre twist, he also made headlines last month when a former fellow resident at the clinic, 36-year-old LeeAnne Rob, was charged with drink-driving his SUV. She also suggested that she had left her watch in his room, although the has since refused to comment on the nature of their relationship. Glum: Ford kept his head down as he took the paths at the center last month, which is just north of Toronto. Reflection: He kept his head down as he walked along the path at GreeneStone Clinic in Ontario. He's. is allowed to leave the clinic to run personal errands such as banking,. but otherwise he's in treatment '24/7,' his lawyer Dennis Morris told the National Post. Ford previously declared that 'rehab is amazing' and that it reminded him. of 'football camp'. Speaking to the Toronto Sun at the start of the month, Ford said he feels 'great' and is benefiting from the. self-imposed exile. 'It. reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I. went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am. learning about myself, my past and things like that.' Luxury: Ford previously claimed that his rehab was costing 100,000 - and said it was worth every cent. Residence: The clinic has 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' with 'rustic suites', its website says. He. joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There. will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.' He said the very public fall from grace - including a video of him smoking crack, being filmed while drunk and making lewd comments about his wife - was what he needed to shake him into action. 'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better,' he told the Sun reporter. He. said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the. morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city. pub. During the rant, he also claimed he was 'in a divorce' and staying at a hotel. He has been married to wife Renata since 2000. Out and about: Ford, 44, has been spotted in the nearby town of Bracebridge, where he has posed for photographs with fans. He has not said how long he will remain there. Out of control: Ford (pictured in January with Toronto's chief budget officer) found himself in deep water last year when a video emerged of him using crack cocaine. Others emerged of his drunken tirades. The. same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail. published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the. illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26 before apparently checking into GreenStone. On the centres website, it says: 'Located in a resort setting in scenic Muskoka, Ontario and equipped with holistic spa services, delicious, nutritious and seasonal menus offered through our Lodge Restaurant, and a full suite of fitness and recreation facilities.' Its accommodation consist of 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' that 'feature rustic suites.' Ford previously indicated to the Toronto Sun that his treatment could cost as much as 100,000. 'It’s worth every dime, every dime,' he said. 'A hundred grand is cheap. It’s a steal.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Toronto's former mayor Rob Ford, who was filmed smoking crack cocaine, had checked himself into the GreeneStone rehab clinic in Ontario after another drunken rant was caught on camera.

Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Ini semua POYO..kari dhal sambal..janji laa..hahaha..kbye..\\" Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided review, it seems to contain negative sentiment, with words such as \\"POYO\\" which is colloquial Malaysian slang signifying disapproval or disbelief in something, suggesting that the reviewer is not impressed or satisfied. Given the lack of any positive comments and the overall tone of the review, it would be reasonable to infer that the star rating would be low. However, it is important to note that assigning a precise star-rating based on solely on a written review that doesn't include an explicit rating can be somewhat subjective and varies depending on particular rating guidelines used by different platforms. In general, a ★-rating (the lowest possible) tends to be assigned for experiences that were highly unsatisfactory across the board, with very few if any redeeming qualities. As such, if the reviewer was extremely dissatisfied with the experience, a ★-rating would be plausible. On the other hand, if there were other aspects of the experience that were not mentioned in the review but were nonetheless satisfactory, the actual rating might be somewhat higher. While this answer provides an educated guess based on the information available, the best way to determine the star rating would be for the reviewer to explicitly provide it. Therefore, based on the information given, it is reasonable to assume that the reviewer might rate the experience as ★ due to their apparent dissatisfaction, but this should be confirmed by the reviewer themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"No, \\"annoyed by Taylor\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would others feel as a result?\\" when referring to Taylor giving their mother a ride. The given scenario of Taylor offering a ride to their mother is generally seen as a positive and caring action, and not one that would generate a negative emotion such as annoyance. There could be multiple reactions from others, based on their relationship with Taylor and their current situation or perspective. Some possible responses could include: 1. Appreciative: Family members, friends, and onlookers could potentially feel appreciative of Taylor for their act of kindness. Helping a family member like this demonstrates care and respect, which people are likely to find endearing and heartwarming. 2. Inspired: Others might feel inspired to perform their own acts of kindness or take on a more active role in supporting their loved ones after witnessing Taylor's thoughtful gesture. 3. Grateful: Taylor's mother, in particular, would likely feel grateful for the ride and for having a considerate, helpful child. This expression of love and support could strengthen their bond and improve their relationship. 4. Relieved: If Taylor's mother had been struggling to find a mode of transportation, others who were aware of her predicament may feel relieved that she now has a reliable way to get around. While it is plausible that certain individuals might have a negative reaction, it is important to note that the given scenario is primarily a positive one rooted in goodwill. To offer additional context, one could argue that maybe someone who wanted to give Taylor's mother a ride themselves or who has a contentious relationship with Taylor might feel annoyed, but such a response would not be a direct result of the act of offering a ride itself.

Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami.

Brady later learns that Mack made a promise to her aunt that after her mother died she would attend a private school and they are to leave the next day. Mack asserts that although going is her choice, she feels it is what she has to do, since it's what her mom would want. She sadly tells Brady they will have to break up. Before Mack leaves, she decides to surf a 40-foot wave that is about to hit the beach. Alarmed, Brady gets on a jet ski and goes after Mack, who is still in the ocean. Mack and Brady end up getting swept away and eventually end up on another beach. They soon realize they have been swept inside Wet Side Story.

Produced in the UK between 1961 and 1962, what was the first UK Gerry Anderson series to be shown overseas????","completion":"The first UK Gerry Anderson series to be shown overseas, produced between 1961 and 1962, was the ground-breaking show called \\"Supercar.\\" This science fiction television series was a pioneer in the world of children's entertainment at the time, employing innovative techniques that would forever change the course of television production. Gerry Anderson, a British television and film producer, created \\"Supercar\\" together with his then-wife, Sylvia Anderson, for British production company AP Films (later rebranded as Century 21 Productions). The series was part of a genre known as \\"Supermarionation,\\" which was a type of puppetry developed by the Andersons. The unique marionette system incorporated solenoid motors and thin wires, enabling the puppets to have more realistic mouth and facial movements in sync with the pre-recorded dialogue. \\"Supercar\\" was a children's TV series consisting of 39 episodes over two seasons, and it followed the thrilling adventures of test pilot Mike Mercury and his state-of-the-art flying automobile, the Supercar. The Supercar was an impressive invention, capable of flying through the air, taking off vertically, traveling underwater, and possessing a never-before-seen level of technology. Set in the fictional Black Rock Laboratory, the series featured various other characters alongside Mike Mercury. Professor Popkiss was the brilliant inventor of the Supercar, Dr. Beaker was the quirky scientist and co-inventor, Mitch the Monkey served as comic relief, and ten-year-old Jimmy Gibson was a fan-favorite. The Supercar team traversed the globe in their adventures, combating criminals, rescuing people from dangerous situations, and exploring the unknown. The success of \\"Supercar\\" paved the way for many other Gerry Anderson productions, such as \\"Fireball XL5,\\" \\"Stingray,\\" \\"Thunderbirds,\\" \\"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons,\\" \\"Joe 90,\\" and \\"Terrahawks.\\" These series showcased the capabilities of the Supermarionation technique, continually refining and improving the puppetry, storytelling, and special effects. \\"Supercar\\" was a milestone in children's television and an essential building block for the Anderson team. As the first Gerry Anderson series to be shown overseas, it introduced the Supermarionation technique to the international market and proved that children's television programs could be intriguing, visually captivating, and innovative. Not only did it inspire other filmmakers and television producers, but it also left a lasting impression on generations of viewers, who continue to cherish the ingenuity and creativity displayed in the series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. Paragraph: John is a world traveler. Recently, he visited two countries, France and Germany. He noticed that in France they use atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units. In Germany they use torr as a pressure unit. Back in the United States, he noticed psi is used as a pressure unit. He needs to figure out how they correlate with each other.

It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones.

Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Direct effects: - Sunny weather encourages bees to go out during the day and gather food, as they are more active in warm and sunny conditions. - The warm weather also helps in the production of beeswax, as it requires a certain temperature to be produced efficiently by the bees. Indirect effects: - With more bees going out to gather food, the production of honey will increase in the larger hive. - The increased activity will also lead to a higher production of propolis, allowing the bees to strengthen and expand their hive. - As the hive grows and becomes more productive, it may attract more bees, leading to an even larger and more efficient hive.

Write an article based on this summary: Admit that you don’t know. Stay active even when things are changing. Make a change to your surroundings. Find humor in the moment.","completion":"Title: Embracing Uncertainty: Strategies for Thriving in a Constantly Changing World Introduction In today's rapidly evolving world, uncertainty has become a constant. New technologies, shifting social norms, and unforeseen challenges make it impossible to predict what the future holds. The ability to adapt, especially during times of uncertainty, is a crucial skill for everyone—in both their personal and professional lives. In this article, we will discuss practical strategies to help you embrace uncertainty and thrive in an ever-changing environment. 1. Admit That You Don't Know Step one in embracing uncertainty is acknowledging that you do not have all the answers. Too often, individuals feel pressured to maintain an illusion of expertise, ultimately hindering their ability to learn and grow. Be open to asking questions and seeking help; admitting you don't know something shows both humility and a willingness to learn. Embracing this mindset promotes personal and professional growth, fostering a foundation of adaptability and resilience. 2. Stay Active Even When Things Are Changing During periods of uncertainty, it can be tempting to simply \\"wait and see\\" how things unfold. However, remaining stagnant can only worsen the situation. Instead, be proactive in facing change head-on by staying active, engaged, and continually learning. This can take the form of pursuing further education, seeking training opportunities, or simply engaging in activities that stretch your comfort zone. Staying active allows you to seize control of your life and make adjustments as needed. 3. Make a Change to Your Surroundings Our physical environment can greatly affect our level of adaptability and resilience. When the world seems unpredictable, introducing small changes to your surroundings can encourage a more adaptable mindset. This may involve rearranging your workspace, picking up a new hobby, or even exploring a different neighborhood. By consciously engaging with change in your daily life, you nurture the ability to cope with larger, more significant changes as they come. 4. Find Humor in the Moment Humor is a powerful tool for navigating uncertainty. When faced with change or new challenges, seeking out and embracing humor can help you cope more effectively. Laughter not only reduces stress hormones but also boosts endorphins, improving mental well-being and strengthening social bonds. Identify situations where humor can be applied without offending anyone or compromising professionalism. Once you can laugh at the ups and downs life throws your way, you will find it much easier to bend with the winds of change. Conclusion Life is fundamentally unpredictable, and uncertainty is inevitable. By admitting that you don't know everything, remaining active and engaged, modifying your surroundings, and finding humor in challenging situations, you can better cope with and even embrace the perpetual changes we all face. As you apply these strategies and develop the skills necessary to adapt, you'll be well-equipped to thrive and find success in our ever-changing world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A new phase in neoclassical design was inaugurated by Robert and James Adam, who travelled in Italy and Dalmatia in the 1750s, observing the ruins of the classical world. On their return to Britain, they published a book entitled The Works in Architecture in installments between 1773 and 1779. This book of engraved designs made the Adam repertory available throughout Europe. The Adam brothers aimed to simplify the rococo and baroque styles which had been fashionable in the preceding decades, to bring what they felt to be a lighter and more elegant feel to Georgian houses. The Works in Architecture illustrated the main buildings the Adam brothers had worked on and crucially documented the interiors, furniture and fittings, designed by the Adams.

Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. I am facing a new situation today: John was studying the species in African Savannah. He noticed that elands, which is a prey animal, are basically nocturnal. On the other hand, wild boars, another prey animal, are not nocturnal. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which species would be less active at night, elands or wild boars? Answer:","completion":"Wild boars would be less active at night compared to elands, as elands are primarily nocturnal while wild boars are not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: how do you empty a plastic pool? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Available choices: (A). fold it on one end.. (B). flip it over..","completion":"To empty a plastic pool, let's examine the two options and justify each step: (A) Fold it on one end: 1. Folding the pool on one end would require gathering the flexible sides and lifting them upwards, which could be difficult depending on the size and shape of the pool. If there is water in the pool, this step may also be challenging due to the weight of the water. 2. As the pool is lifted, the water will start to pour out from the raised end. However, this might not be efficient in removing all the water, as some can still remain trapped in the lower end. 3. Once the majority of the water has been emptied, you would need to adjust the pool again to get rid of the remaining water. This might require additional time and effort. (B) Flip it over: 1. Flipping the pool over requires less effort than folding, especially if the pool's shape and size allow for easy maneuvering. Depending on the weight of the water inside, this step might still be challenging, but more manageable than folding. 2. Once the pool is flipped, gravity will do the work and push most, if not all, of the water out of the pool. This will allow for a more efficient and fast emptying process. 3. After the water is emptied, some residual water may still be present on the surface of the pool. You can easily wipe it off with a cloth or let it air dry. Considering the steps involved in each method, option (B) flipping the pool over makes more sense to accomplish the goal of emptying the plastic pool. The reasons include the easier maneuvering required to flip rather than fold, the efficiency of removing most of the water using gravity, and less required effort overall."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The water was eroding the area under the deck faster than the porch, because the","completion":"deck was constructed with poor drainage planning, causing water to accumulate and stagnate beneath it, which in turn amplified the erosion process. Unlike the porch, which had been built with adequate slope and gutter systems to channel water away from its foundation, the deck lacked essential water management features, thus exacerbating the deterioration of the underlying soil. Moreover, the materials used in the construction of the deck - primarily wood and metal fasteners - were more susceptible to water damage, including rot and rust, as compared to the porch's stronger, more durable construction materials such as concrete or brick. Over time, the constant exposure to moisture accelerated the weakening and eventual failure of the deck's support structures, compounding the damage caused by the eroding soil below. Additionally, the location and landscaping of the two structures played a role in the rate of water-induced erosion. The deck was situated in an area of the property where runoff from the roof, yard, and adjacent hardscape surfaces was more likely to pool and infiltrate the soil beneath it. The porous nature of the soil in that specific area, combined with the lack of proper vegetation or ground cover, facilitated rapid water absorption and soil displacement. Conversely, the porch was built on a more stable and well-draining substrate, and the surrounding landscaping featured strategically planted trees and plants, which helped to mitigate erosion and keep the area under the porch drier. Another factor contributing to the faster erosion under the deck was the differing maintenance practices applied to both structures. The porch, being a more frequently utilized living space, regularly underwent inspections and minor repair work, ensuring its drainage systems remained clear of debris and its structure maintained its integrity. On the other hand, the deck, being less visible and less frequently maintained, gradually succumbed to minor leaks, clogging gutters, and wood decay, all of which contributed to the continuous moisture buildup and soil erosion beneath. Finally, the overall design differences between the porch and the deck played a role in the rate of erosion. The porch's closed, elevated, and well-ventilated structure allowed for better air circulation, faster evaporation of moisture, and less direct contact between its foundation and the wet soil below. In contrast, the open design of the deck created an environment in which air circulation was limited, and the wooden support structures were in direct contact with the moist, eroding soil, further escalating the rate of damage over time. In conclusion, the water eroded the area under the deck faster than the porch due to a combination of factors including poor drainage planning, less durable construction materials, the location and landscaping of the structures, differing maintenance practices, and the overall design of the two structures. Addressing these factors through proper construction, landscaping, and routine maintenance can help to prevent such erosion issues in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Let Sikh Americans serve in the U.S. military By Simran Jeet Singh, G.B. Singh, Published: August 5 at 4:45 pm One year ago today, a white supremacist walked into a Sikh place of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and opened fire on the congregation. The largest single act of hate-based violence in recent American history captured the attention of Americans across the country and cast the spotlight on a minority community that has been disproportionately targeted by this type of violence. Sikhs have been in America for over a century now and have contributed to this nation in various ways, from education and medicine to public service and law enforcement. However, Sikh Americans who maintain their turbans and beards are still presumptively barred from serving in the military. There have been rare exceptions to the prohibition but what is needed is widespread change. Changing this discriminatory policy would help cultivate a national military that better represents the richness and diversity of the American experience. Changing this policy would also send a powerful message to those who narrowly define what it means to be American and engage in hate violence against those they perceive to be “the other.” A close look at the reasons used to justify the ban of the Sikh articles of faith demonstrates that these arguments are flawed. One of the more common arguments is that Sikhs are unable to wear helmets and protective masks over their turbans and beards, and therefore, they bring unnecessary risk to themselves and their peers. This claim is outdated and patently untrue – Sikhs have a long tradition of military service and have not had a problem placing helmets over their turbans and uncut hair. Moreover, it has been years since the military developed protective masks that safely protect people with facial hair. This argument may have been relevant in the early twentieth century when the policy was first implemented. At that time gas masks were unable to sufficiently protect soldiers with facial hair. However, this issue has been resolved and no longer justifies excluding Sikh Americans from military service. Some proponents of the ban cite the risk of disunity that would come with modernizing appearance regulations. However, over the past decade, the Army has granted exemptions to three turbaned Sikh Americans, two of whom have been deployed to Afghanistan and demonstrated exceptional service in the battlefield – Major Kamaljit Singh Kalsi and Captain Tejdeep Singh Rattan. Last year Major Kalsi received a Bronze Star Medal, the fourth highest combat award in the Armed Forces, for saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. This honor, along with the centuries-long tradition of Sikhs serving in the military, illustrates that the turban and beard do not inhibit soldiers from performing their duties alongside their compatriots. The service of these three Sikh Americans also proves that diversity has a place within the military. Certainly there is value in maintaining a shared uniform and discipline for all soldiers, but accounting for and adapting to religiously mandated articles of faith has only served to strengthen the Armed Forces. The Sikh tradition appreciates the importance of maintaining common identifying features and the notion of uniformity is often invoked to understand the distinctive physical identity of Sikhs across the globe. In practice, Sikh soldiers conform the color and style of their religious articles to military dress codes, and groom and tie their beards in a neat and conservative manner, in full compliance with safety requirements. The service of these three turbaned Sikhs has demonstrated that accounting for religious articles of faith will not undermine esprit de corps in the military. Rather, opening up to diversity will help us focus squarely on whether a soldier can do his or her job. The presumptive ban on religious articles of faith adversely affects Sikh Americans in other ways as well. In addition to its discriminatory nature, this policy also perpetuates the alienation of religious minorities in this country. Until Sikh Americans are allowed to serve in the military, the general public will continue to see them as outsiders and aliens rather than fully integrated participants in American society. Repealing the ban against turbaned Sikhs will go a long way in preventing future hate violence such as school bullying, workplace discrimination, or mass shootings like the one we witnessed a year ago in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Modern society has come to increasingly accept and embrace diversity. Last September, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law AB1964, the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, the strongest and most comprehensive equal employment legislation in the country. Among other issues, this act forbids segregation of individuals who wear religious articles, such as facial hair or head coverings. The U.S. Armed Forces should be ahead of these changes rather than behind them. The hate-motivated shooting in Oak Creek did not happen in a vacuum. Our nation maintains a number of problematic policies that unintentionally influence many of our misguided perceptions. The presumptive ban barring Sikhs from the Armed Forces is one of these policies, and it is time for the military to reverse this ban. The image of a military that reflects the full diversity of patriotic and contributing Americans would go a long way in preventing future hate-inspired atrocities like the one we saw last year in Wisconsin. Simran Jeet Singh is a Sikh American, social activist, and scholar completing his PhD in the Department of Religion at Columbia University. G.B. Singh is a veteran of the US Army (Retired Colonel). He served in the Army while maintaining his turban and beard from 1979 to 2007.

Q: What is the term for a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells? A: Options: [A]. cell membrane [B]. cell wall [C]. placental barrier [D]. tight junction Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question The question asks for the term that describes a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells. Step 2: Evaluate the options Option A: Cell membrane - The cell membrane is a thin, flexible barrier that surrounds a cell and controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Although it plays a part in maintaining the cell's integrity, it is not specifically a term for a watertight seal between two adjacent cells. Option B: Cell wall - The cell wall is a structural layer surrounding some cells, located outside the cell membrane. It provides protection and support for the cell. However, animal cells do not have cell walls, and it is not a specific term for a watertight seal between adjacent cells. Option C: Placental barrier - The placental barrier is a membrane found in the placenta that separates the mother's blood from the fetus's blood. It is not a specific term for a watertight seal between two adjacent cells. Option D: Tight junction - Tight junctions are specialized connections between adjacent animal cells that create a barrier to prevent the movement of substances through the space between the cells. They form a watertight seal and help maintain cell polarity and tissue integrity.

Teens may look like young adults but their brain structure is similar to that of much younger children. \\"It is not always easy for teens to pay attention in class without letting their minds wander, or to ignore distractions from their younger brothers or sisters when trying to solve a maths problem,\\" said Dr Iroise Dumon-theil. \\"But it's not the fault of teenagers that they can't pay attention and are easily distracted.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. I would like to learn to ride a bicycle rather than a unicycle. To learn to ride the a). unicycle is easy.; b). bicycle is easy.;","completion":"I would like to learn to ride a bicycle rather than a unicycle. To learn to ride a bicycle is easy. Riding a bicycle offers various benefits, making it an attractive skill to acquire. For instance, cycling is an excellent way to stay fit and healthy since it works multiple muscle groups and improves cardiovascular endurance. Additionally, biking is an environmentally friendly method of transportation, as it contributes to reducing one's carbon footprint. Furthermore, it is also a cost-effective means of travel, with lower maintenance costs compared to motor vehicles. Learning to ride a bicycle is generally easier than learning to ride a unicycle, thanks to its design and the more widespread availability of learning resources. The bicycle's two wheels ensure greater stability, and the handlebars allow better control over balance and direction. Moreover, many people worldwide have experience riding bicycles and can offer valuable advice or guidance for beginners. To begin learning to ride a bicycle, follow these steps: 1. Choose a suitable bike: Ensure that your bicycle is the appropriate size for your height and offers a comfortable seating position. Familiarize yourself with its components, such as the brake levers, gear shifters, seat height adjustment, and tire pressure. 2. Find a flat, quiet area to practice: Locate a spacious area with low foot and vehicle traffic, like a park or an empty parking lot. 3. Prepare to ride: Wear a helmet for safety, and consider using additional protective gear such as knee pads, elbow pads, and gloves. 4. Work on your balance: Start by straddling the bike with both feet flat on the ground. Hold the handlebars firmly while practicing pushing off and lifting your feet onto the pedals without wobbling too much. 5. Begin pedaling: Once you feel comfortable with your balance, push off with one foot and start pedaling slowly. Keep your weight centered over the bike and look straight ahead, not at the ground. 6. Practice steering and turning: As you become more comfortable pedaling, gradually incorporate gentle turns, making sure to lean slightly into the direction you are turning. 7. Learn to brake: Familiarize yourself with the brake levers on your bicycle. Practice gently squeezing the brakes while riding at a manageable speed, ensuring that you maintain control of the bike and come to a smooth stop. 8. Build confidence and skill: Continue practicing your riding skills by increasing the difficulty, such as tackling small inclines or trying out various road or path surfaces. 9. Observe traffic rules: Once you're confident in your abilities, learn the traffic rules and regulations for cyclists in your region before venturing into busier areas or sharing the road with motor vehicles. In comparison, unicycling involves balancing on a single wheel, necessitating more advanced balance and coordination skills. While unicycling can be an exciting and unique challenge, most people find learning to ride a bicycle significantly easier and more practical for daily use. So, learning to ride a bicycle is not only advantageous but also highly accessible and enjoyable."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Minn. town plans to privatize policing The central Minnesota town of Foley tried having its own police department and contracting with the county sheriff's department for law enforcement. Now, in an effort to save money, the city with a population of 2,600 is making a controversial move few others have done: Starting in January, it plans to employ a private security company to patrol its streets. Foley is believed to be the first town in Minnesota to replace its police force with private guards, according to the Minnesota attorney general's office. Nationwide, other cities have supplemented their traditional police with contracted officers, said John Firman, director of research for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Firman said an entirely private security force is a new approach, and his organization hasn't gotten many calls from communities considering the idea. But as cities across the USA struggle with the economic downturn, more will look at innovative ways of providing public safety, Firman said. \\"For the first time in our history … police are no longer immune from budget cuts,\\" he said. In Minnesota, 59 police departments have been dissolved or combined with other departments since 2000, according to the League of Minnesota Cities. Since it disbanded its police department in 2003, Foley has contracted with the Benton County Sheriff's Office to have three deputies patrol the city, providing coverage for about 17 hours a day. This year, the city paid 24,694 a month for the contract. After cuts in state aid and uncertainty about future funding, the Foley City Council started looking at options to save money on policing. The city decided to contract with General Security Services Corp. to provide 24-hour coverage starting in January for about 16,000 a month. GSSC has been in operation for 65 years, Vice President Jackson Hall said. The company has 3,800 employees securing 244 federal courthouses in 44 states. Bill Leoni, director of northern regions, said the company has had a number of contracts with cities to provide specific services. Foley is the first city that GSSC will provide a \\"full spectrum\\" of services, he said. Leoni said GSSC security officers go through extensive training comparable to police officers. They will carry firearms for their own protection and not to enforce laws, he said. The security officers will provide routine patrols and preventive work, things police don't always have time to do anymore, Leoni said. \\"They will provide a highly visible presence,\\" he said. State and county officials say they have questions about how the security officers will operate and what the impact will be. In an Oct. 25 letter, Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson warned that the city is opening itself up to \\"financial exposure.\\" She cited the potential for lawsuits for false imprisonment as one example. Swanson wrote that private security employees may carry a firearm but can use it only in self-defense. Private guards do not have the authority to make arrests other than citizens' arrests, cannot pursue fleeing suspects, make DWI arrests or even traffic stops. There's also the issue of whether self-incriminating statements or evidence taken from a suspect by a security officer could be used in court, she wrote. The IACP doesn't take a position on different policing models, but it does advise cities to plan ahead and not make rushed decisions, Firman said. What appears to be an immediate cost-saving measure may not save any money in the long run, he said. \\"What's driving it is the money, but what we're concerned about is the money doesn't hide the principal issues, which are officer safety and public safety,\\" Firman said. Minnesota Sheriff's Association Executive Director James Franklin said the move raises basic questions on who pays for public safety. Because sheriff's departments are responsible for law enforcement throughout a county, Foley residents will have the benefit of deputies who will respond to emergencies and investigate crimes. Since cities use more police services than rural residents, it's a question of who should be paying for those services, Franklin said. \\"Are the rest of the taxpayers subsidizing the city of Foley?\\" Franklin said. \\"That's for the taxpayers to decide.\\" Petrie and Marohn report for the St. Cloud (Minn.)

The mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could. Hearing her voice, the little boy made a U--turn to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him. The mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator pulled his legs. That began an unbelievable tug-of-war between _ . The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother did her best not to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard their screams, rushed from his truck and helped them. Luckily, after weeks and weeks in the hospital, the little boy survived. His legs were seriously scarred by the terrible attack of the animal. And on his arms, were deep scars where his mother's fingernails dug into his arms in her effort to pull the son she loved. The newspaper reporter, who interviewed the boy, asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted the legs. And then, he said to the reporter, \\"Look at my arms.

Here, I will provide a detailed explanation of how this conclusion could be reached, and the factors that could possibly affect this deduction. First, let's break down the information provided: 1. The man is Asian: This information establishes the ethnicity of the individual in question. 2. The man is in a suit and glasses: This detail might suggest that the person is dressed for a professional setting or business environment. 3. The man is taking a nap: This piece of information indicates that the individual is tired or perhaps trying to utilize some spare time to rest. 4. The location is by the doors in a subway: This statement provides context of where the scene is taking place – in a public transportation system, specifically near the doors of a subway train. 5. The man is on the train for business: This additional piece of information gives us a possible purpose behind the individual's use of public transportation – for business-related reasons. Now that we have the information, we can attempt to connect the dots and make some educated assumptions in order to reach the conclusion that \\"an Asian man in a suit and glasses takes a nap by the doors in a subway.\\" The man's attire (suit and glasses) may lead us to believe that he is professionally employed or engaged in business activities. Furthermore, since it was explicitly mentioned that the man is on the train for business, we can safely assume that he is using the subway for commuting to or from work or another business-related destination. Considering that the man is taking a nap, it might be inferred that he could be tired from a long day at work, or perhaps he is attempting to catch up on some sleep during his daily commute. This could be due to a busy professional lifestyle, or it might just be that the man is taking advantage of a moment of downtime in his day. Finally, taking into account that the man is resting by the doors, it's plausible that he found this spot to be the most suitable or convenient for a brief moment of rest. This location could provide the man with a more comfortable or convenient resting spot compared to other seating options available within the subway train. In light of this analysis, it seems reasonable to draw the conclusion that \\"an Asian man in a suit and glasses takes a nap by the doors in a subway\\" if \\"the Asian man is on the train for business.\\" However, it is essential to recognize that this conclusion is based on interpretations and assumptions made from the information provided.

While concentration might be an issue for some children, it's not directly relevant to the given statement, which is about their inability to follow the original rules. 3. Winning: Winning refers to the act of succeeding or being victorious in a game. This isn't the right answer because the statement doesn't mention anything about the children's ability to win the game or their concern about winning; it's related to their inability to remember the rules. 4. Count: In some card games, counting is a skill that involves keeping track of cards that have been played or estimating the possible value of other players' hands. While this skill is essential in specific games, it's not the reason why the children create their own rules as stated in the question. In conclusion, the best answer is \\"remember\\" because it's the only choice that aligns with the context of the statement: the children are unable to recall the original rules, so they make up their own rules while playing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

He is contacted by a mysterious and wealthy client to investigate an encrypted flash drive supposedly containing evidence of corrupt law enforcement officers working for Kubichek. Intrigued and motivated by the opportunity to expose the treacherous corruption within the system, Flynn accepts the case. Act 2: As Flynn investigates, he decrypts the flash drive and discovers not only names of corrupt officers but also incriminating information on Kubichek's illegal operations. Flynn begins to take down individual officers, causing a series of events that attracts Kubichek's attention and ire. To protect his empire, Kubichek targets Flynn by putting a hit on him, as well as using his corrupt officers to frame and discredit the private investigator. Flynn, realizing the grave danger he's in, recruits some of his contacts and allies for help, including an ex-cop with inside knowledge on Kubichek's operations, a gifted hacker, and a former mob enforcer seeking redemption. Act 3: Cornered by Kubichek's men, Flynn and his ragtag team devise an elaborate plan to outwit the criminal mastermind and his henchmen, with the intention to expose Kubichek to the authorities and bring down his empire, while clearing Flynn's name. In a thrilling sequence of events, Flynn and his team use their specific set of skills to trap, deceive, and capture Kubichek's men and delve deeper into the villain's lair. As the plot unfolds and tensions rise, several unexpected betrayals occur within Flynn's team, and Flynn is forced to face Kubichek on his own. Act 4: In an intense, action-packed climax, Flynn confronts Kubichek, leading to a brutal hand-to-hand fight in which Flynn ultimately emerges victorious. Having collected enough evidence and backed by some trustworthy law enforcement officers, Flynn exposes Kubichek's extensive criminal empire and the corrupt officers he employed, putting an end to his reign of terror. The film ends with Flynn's good name restored and the promise of new beginnings on the horizon. Throughout the movie, Into the Lair explores themes of trust, moral ambiguity, redemption, and the battle between good and evil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a summary based on this article: At almost 11 a.m., it's still fairly quiet at the Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach, Florida even during the peak of the college spring break season. It's raining and the pool deck is mostly empty. The whole hotel seems to be stumbling towards its figurative coffee pot. But the highrise hotel on the beach is about to get a very distinctive wake-up call. Since 2012, the party-hearty highrise in Panama City Beach has been getting things started at the crack of 11 a.m. during spring break, blasting the song \\"Circle of Life\\" from the soundtrack to Disney's \\"The Lion King,\\" through its loudspeakers on the pool deck. As the music plays, spring breakers from their balconies in the hotel raise their hands in the air, shouting along with the lyrics and occasionally holding imaginary lion cubs in the air, reenacting the scene from the movie. The song was released in 1994, making it about as old as your average college spring breaker. \\"For these kids, this would have been one of their first Disney movies,\\" said the hotel's director of marketing Philip Colvin. \\"We thought it would be kind of neat to play something from their childhood and see how they react to it. \\"We were overwhelmed by how they reacted to it. We've done all sorts of songs as a wake-up song and none of them had the reaction that this one did.\\" Colvin said the song has become a huge hit among spring breakers. \\"It started as just a funny idea to see what would happen,\\" Colvin said. \\"It's kind of a tradition now. Now if we don't do it or talk about not doing it, people get upset with us.\\" Though the song has been a staple at the Holiday Inn spring break experience since 2012, it's only recently gained widespread notoriety. A video posted on Facebook this week by a local TV reporter now has almost 3 million views, as the story spreads through local and national media. See the video above to watch the unique wake-up call in action. ||||| Florida authorities have found the teenager who they feared was in danger after she was photographed naked and surrounded by men. She told authorities she is safe. The Bay County Sheriff's Office said the 17-year-old, who was not identified, got in touch with authorities after she saw media reports that police were worried about her. \\"She lives in the southern part of the United States and told investigators she visited Panama City Beach for spring break, although she does not attend college,\\" a news release from the sheriff's office said. \\"She is 17 years of age and although she stated her behavior and interaction with the crowd was consensual and she is safe, she did not realize that someone was taking her picture.\\" BCSO spokesperson Ruth Corley previously told the News Herald that her office wasn't \\"trying to get her into trouble. \\"We want to make sure she isn’t in trouble.” The sheriff's office said the matter is still under investigation.

In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision. Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. You should write an incorrect option. Even though there exist multiple wrong answers, we only need a single wrong answer. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. (“Allegations of date, time or place satisfy the Rule 9(b) requirement that the circumstances of the alleged fraud must be pleaded with particularity, but alternative means are also available to satisfy the rule.”). Under this Court’s nuanced, case-by-case approach, other means are available to present the required indicia of reliability that a false’ claim was actually submitted. Although there are no bright-line rules, our case law has indicated that a relator with direct, first-hand knowledge of the defendants’ submission of false claims gained through her employment with the defendants may have a sufficient basis for asserting that the defendants actually submitted false claims.

Movie title: The Punisher Context: Frank Castle is the city's most wanted, and most mysterious, vigilante, known as \\"The Punisher\\". He has killed 125 criminals in the past five years. An ex-police officer, Castle's family was murdered in a mob hit, in which Castle was also thought to have perished. This combined with Castle's furtive methods of attack have made the Punisher's identity a mystery to the general public. Living in the sewers and waging a one-man war against organized crime, his only friend is an old alcoholic named Shake, a former stage actor who speaks in rhyme for reasons unexplained. Now legally declared dead, Castle strikes back from beyond the grave, killing mobsters wherever he can find them. Due to his war against them, the Mafia families have weakened, forcing one of the family leaders, Gianni Franco, to come out of retirement. Franco has a plan to unify the families. This, however, has attracted the attention of the Yakuza, Asia's most powerful crime syndicate. Led by Lady Tanaka, the Yakuza decide to take over the Mafia families and all of their interests. In order to sway the mobsters to their cause, they kidnap their children and hold them for ransom. Shake pleads with the Punisher to save the children, who are likely to be sold into the Arab slave trade regardless of whether or not the Mafia give into the demands. The Punisher attacks Yakuza businesses, warning that for every day the children are held in captivity, he will inflict heavy costs on them in property damage. The Yakuza later capture the Punisher and Shake and attempt to torture them into submission, but Punisher breaks free and decides the only course of action is a direct rescue. He is able to save most of the children with a .45 Thompson M1928 submachine gun against the Yakuza guards and commandeers a bus to get the kidnapped children to safety.

Althouhg it is nice to see dinosaurs instead of all the other familiar characters, all of the other pop-up boxes I've seen \\"reward\\" the child by popping up with much less hand strength required. A:","completion":"The provided review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product, especially if you are intending to purchase the toy for a toddler, for a few reasons. Firstly, the problem of the toy requiring too much strength has been clearly highlighted in the review. Toddlers in general do not have great physical strength, and toys that are difficult to operate can cause more frustration than enjoyment. A key role of toys in a child's early development is promoting fine motor skills improvement, so if a toy is too difficult to manipulate, it may not be suitable for age-appropriate growth and development. In this case, the complaint that the springs on the toy are too tight, making it difficult for babies and toddlers to operate, would be a significant deterrent. Secondly, while the presence of dinosaur characters instead of the usual ones might bring some novelty, this unique aspect is overshadowed by the functionality issue. The primary look and theme of the toy are secondary to the comfort and usability for a toddler. If the child is unable to engage with the toy due to its stiffness, then even the most interesting characters wouldn't enhance the appeal of the toy. Thirdly, the comparison made with other pop-up boxes, which the reviewer mentions are usually designed to \\"reward\\" the child with less strength needed, also decreases the chances of buying the product. This indicates that there are alternative toys on the market that are more suitable for toddlers. In conclusion, the overall effect of this review would likely discourage potential buyers, specifically those who intend to buy for toddlers, based on the highlighted concerns regarding its operation and the availability of better-suited alternatives in the market."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr., a wool trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King (nee Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the Oak Park, Illinois, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. To become House Speaker, Ford worked to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber, often traveling on the rubber chicken circuit. After a decade of failing to do so, he promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted 29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to The New York Times, Nixon \\"sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.\\" The advice was unanimous. \\"We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,\\" House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later. Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the Vice Presidency would be \\"a nice conclusion\\" to his career. Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and William Hathaway of Maine. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States. Ford became Vice President as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig contacted Ford to tell him that \\"smoking gun\\" evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, \\"Al Haig asked to come over and see me,\\" Ford later said, \\"to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.'\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Who is Ford and why did he become the Vice President? Ford, or Gerald Ford, was an American politician who became the Vice President of the United States after the previous Vice President, Spiro Agnew, resigned due to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To understand why, we must first analyze each sentence separately and identify the main ideas they convey. Sentence 1: \\"uh-huh well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there\\" This sentence acknowledges that the speaker believes the subject being discussed has a \\"great system\\" or an effective process in place. The use of \\"uh-huh\\" conveys a casual agreement or understanding, while the term \\"worked out\\" implies that the system has been carefully developed and implemented. Sentence 2: \\"Our system could use some work to be more efficient.\\" In contrast, this sentence highlights that the main idea is that the speaker's system requires improvement in order to become more efficient. The phrase \\"could use some work\\" indicates that there is room for adjustments and development to ensure optimal functioning. By comparing the two sentences, it becomes evident that they express different points of view on the matter in question. Sentence 1 acknowledges a well-designed and effective system, while Sentence 2 suggests that the current system requires improvements and optimization. Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Instead, they present differing perspectives on the efficiency and functionality of the system in question. In essence, the first sentence is a positive perspective with an assumption of efficiency, while the second offers a more critical and realistic viewpoint, admitting the need for enhancements and optimization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - The United States Ambassador to the United Nations is the leader of the U.S. delegation, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.

The proposed new system would still require proof that harm was caused by treatment but would remove the need to prove negligence. Minister for Public Health Michael Matheson said: \\"We know that the vast majority of the care delivered in our NHS is of the highest quality, but it is important that people who have suffered as a result of clinical mistakes should have some form of redress. \\"It's in no-one's best interests to have that redress delayed because a compensation claim can take years to go through the courts. \\"Nor is it in anyone's interests to have precious NHS resources spent on expensive legal fees.\\" He added: \\"It is important that we seek wider views in order to help in our understanding of what the practical implications would be.\\" No-fault systems are already in place in countries such as Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and New Zealand, and parts of the US.

Does the sentence \\"Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is the number range of living bird species?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050\\" does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is the number range of living bird species?\\" The question aims to find the number range of currently living bird species across the world. The response to this question accurately gives a numerical range, which is between 9,800 and 10,050 species. This range hints at the fact that there is not a universal agreement on the exact number, thus there’s variation, which in this case addressed as a \\"taxonomic viewpoint\\". It implies that the classification of bird species, which is a scientific endeavor undertaken by taxonomists, can involve some level of disagreement, leading to variations in the exact number of known species. Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing and classifying organisms and includes all plants, animals and microorganisms of the world. This field uses various investigative procedures that can lead to differing conclusions and subsequently the classification of a species. Therefore, because new species can be discovered, and existing species can be reclassified, the exact number of bird species may vary. For example, what one taxonomist may classify as a single species, another might classify as two different species. Further, as more research is conducted, and with advances in genetic sequencing, taxonomists may further divide existing species into additional ones, or alternatively, lump what were thought to be separate species together. This is particularly true in areas with high biodiversity where new species are often being discovered. It is also exacerbated by the existence of cryptic species - groups of species which look nearly identical to the naked eye, but are genetically distinct. Moreover, sometimes due to environmental changes, some species might become extinct, which also affects the total count. Conversely, there could also be instances of new species emerging which have not yet been discovered or officially recorded - again affecting the precise number. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9,800 to 10,050.\\" does indeed provide a valid and comprehensive answer to \\"What is the number range of living bird species?\\" It reveals the expected uncertainty in the exact count due to several factors, including varying taxonomic interpretations and the dynamic nature of biological species in the face of changing environments."},{"prompt":"In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity.

Q: Passage: The sun set over Framheim on 21 April, not to reappear for four months. Amundsen was mindful of the boredom and loss of morale that had blighted the Belgica expedition's winter in the ice, and although there was no possibility of sledging he ensured that the shore party kept busy. One urgent task was to improve the sledges, which had not worked well during the depot journeys. In addition to those chosen specifically for the expedition, Amundsen had brought along several sledges from Sverdrup's 1898–1902 Fram expedition, which he now thought would be better suited to the task ahead. Bjaaland reduced the weight of these older sledges by almost a third by planing down the timber, and also constructed three sledges of his own from some spare hickory wood. The adapted sledges were to be used to cross the Barrier, while Bjaaland's new set would be used in the final stages of the journey, across the polar plateau itself. Johansen prepared the sledging rations (42,000 biscuits, 1,320 tins of pemmican and about 220 pounds (100 kg) of chocolate), while other men worked on improving the boots, cooking equipment, goggles, skis and tents. To combat the dangers of scurvy, twice a day the men ate seal meat that had been collected and frozen in quantities before the onset of winter. The cook, Lindstrøm, supplemented the vitamin C intake with bottled cloudberries and blueberries, and provided wholemeal bread made with fresh yeast, rich in B vitamins.While Amundsen was confident in his men and equipment, he was, Hassel recorded, tormented by thoughts of Scott's motor sledges and the fear that these would carry the British party to success. With this in mind Amundsen planned to begin the polar journey as soon as the sun rose in late August, though Johansen warned that it would be too cold on the Barrier so early in the season. Amundsen overruled him, and at sunrise on 24 August seven sledges were made ready. Johansen's concerns seemed justified, as harsh conditions for the next two weeks—temperatures as low as −58 °C (−72 °F)—prevented the men from leaving. On 8 September 1911, when the temperature rose to −27 °C (−17 °F), Amundsen decided he could wait no longer, and the party of eight set off; Lindstrøm remained alone at Framheim.

Answer:","completion":"Sergey Gerasimov's 1953 film \\"Twelfth Night\\" is often compared to Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\" in its essential storyline. Both plays involve themes of love, jealousy, betrayal, and the consequences of misunderstanding. \\"Twelfth Night\\" is a Soviet adaptation of William Shakespeare's comedy \\"Twelfth Night, or What You Will.\\" The story revolves around the shipwrecked Viola who disguises herself as a man named Cesario and enters the service of Duke Orsino. Orsino is in love with the countess Olivia, but she falls for Cesario (Viola in disguise), leading to a complicated love triangle. In the end, Viola reveals her true identity, and the characters find their proper romantic partners.

Iago, Othello's ensign, manipulates Othello into believing that Desdemona has been unfaithful to him, causing Othello to become consumed by jealousy and eventually leading to the tragic downfall of himself and others around him. The comparison between the two can mainly be drawn due to the themes they share. While \\"Twelfth Night\\" is a comedy and \\"Othello\\" is a tragedy, both are rich explorations of human emotions like love, jealousy, and betrayal. The confusion and misunderstandings that arise from the characters' actions, the use of disguises, and the consequences of unchecked emotions are aspects that tie these two Shakespearean works together.

Summarize this article: Kelsey Osborne and her kids, Madyson and Ryker (Photo: Kelsey Osborne) GOODING - It's a topic that has sparked debate across the nation over the last few years - legalizing marijuana. In Idaho, recreational and medical marijuana is still illegal. Last month, Kelsey Osborne, a Gooding mother of two, had her children taken from her after she gave her daughter a smoothie with marijuana in it as an attempt to stop her seizures. A month later, the two children - Madyson and Ryker - are still living with their father and Osborne is still trying to get them back. \\"I didn't ever think it would come down to this, but it did,\\" Osborne told KTVB. \\"It tore me apart.\\" She says her 3-year-old daughter has a history of seizures, but one morning early October, it was worse than ever before. \\"They would stop and come back, stop and come back with the hallucinations and everything else,\\" Osborne said. At the time of her seizure, Madyson was withdrawing from a medication called Risperdal, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. Osborne says when she couldn't calm her daughter down, she gave Madyson a smoothie with a tablespoon of marijuana-infused butter. \\"Everything stopped 30 minutes later,\\" said Osborne. A couple of hours later, Osborne took Madyson to the doctor. That's where she tested positive for marijuana and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare was called. She was charged with misdemeanor injury to a child, and has pleaded not guilty. \\"To me I felt like it was my last resort,\\" said Osborne, who maintains that she did the right thing. \\"I've seen it for my own eyes with people out of state who have used it and it's helped them or their children.\\" Tom Shanahan with the Department of Health and Welfare says in any case dealing with marijuana, there is one bottom line. \\"Marijuana is illegal, period,\\" said Shanahan. States that border Idaho, including Montana, Oregon, and Washington have legalized medical or recreational marijuana, and in some cases both. But Idaho isn't one of them and Shanahan says the two drugs aren't interchangeable. \\"Even in states that have legalized it it's not legal to give to children,\\" said Shanahan. \\"The cannabis that is used for children with epilepsy is called cannabidiol oil and it has had THC removed from it.\\" Without THC, there aren't any psychoactive properties found in the drug. \\"It can cause brain development issues with a child, so we view that as unsafe or illegal,\\" said Shanahan. \\"We want children to be in a safe place.\\" Meanwhile Osborne says she will continue trying to get her children back, who are currently with staying with their father. \\"I'm not going to stop,\\" she said. While cannabidiol oil (CBD) is still illegal in Idaho, Shanahan says there is a program in Boise through the FDA that uses CBD as an experimental treatment for 34 children with severe epilepsy. According to Shanahan, there are strict guidelines for those who qualify, one being that the child has to have tried several other treatments that have failed to work. \\"It's a totally different substance and I think people confuse that,\\" he said.

(KBOI photo) Kelsey Osborne and the Idaho Mom’s for Marijuana group rallied outside of the Department of Health and Welfare in Boise Thursday afternoon, calling for medical marijuana reform. \\"Hopefully it'll open everybody's eyes on cannabis,” Osborne said. The Department of Health and Welfare placed Osborne’s two children – Madyson, 3, and Ryker, 2, with her ex-husband in Jerome, leaving her with only supervised visitation rights. \\"It tore me apart,” Osborne said, choking back tears. “I didn't ever think that it would come down to this but it did.\\" It all started in early October when her daughter, Madyson, was suffering from seizures and hallucinations after coming off a prescription anti-psychotic medication. Osborne said she did what she thought was right as a mother; she made Madyson a smoothie with marijuana butter. She has since been charged with a misdemeanor count of injury to a child. But says she will continue to protest Child Protection Services until she regains custody. \\"It's something that I'm going to fight for and I'm not going to give up until I have them back home where they have been begging me to be,\\" Osborne said. \\"I'm not going to stop. I won't stop. If it takes me two years, then it's going to take me two years.\\" Tom Shanahan, spokesman for the Department of Health and Welfare, responded to the protesters, saying CPS simply follows the laws currently in place. At the end of the day, the department’s main concern is the safety of the children involved. “Marijuana is illegal. Even in states that have legalized it, it is not legal to use on children,\\" Shanahan said. In Idaho, medicinal marijuana is only legal for a small group of children with epilepsy. The 34 children enrolled have to go through a series of tests before getting approved, and even then it is a different form of cannabis than that of recreational marijuana, according to Shanahan. “There’s two different kinds of substances. The one they use for epilepsy doesn’t have THC, it doesn’t appear to have any kind of brain development issues. Recreational marijuana does cause that so it’s not safe for these children.” |||||","completion":"A mother in Gooding, Idaho had her two children taken away from her after she gave her three-year-old daughter a smoothie containing marijuana in an attempt to stop her seizures.

What is the answer: James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, declared himself King and was crowned in Chard and in Taunton in 1685 in an attempt to overthrow whom?","completion":"James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, declared himself King and was crowned in Chard and in Taunton in 1685 in an attempt to overthrow his uncle, King James II of England and Ireland and VII of Scotland (also referred to as James VII and II). The Duke of Monmouth was the illegitimate son of King Charles II and his mistress, Lucy Walter. Monmouth's rebellion, also known as the Monmouth Rebellion or the West Country Rebellion, was an attempt to capture the English throne following the death of his father, King Charles II, in 1685. King James II ascended to the throne in February 1685 after the death of his older brother, King Charles II. James II was a Roman Catholic, and his ascent to the throne made the Protestant population in England uneasy. The anti-Catholic sentiment in England and Scotland, combined with Monmouth's Protestant faith and his existing support base from his years as a military leader, encouraged him to rise against his uncle James II. Monmouth believed that he had a legitimate claim to the English throne, based on rumors that Charles II and Lucy Walter had secretly married, thus making him a legitimate son and heir. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim, and Charles II never acknowledged Monmouth as a legitimate heir. In June 1685, Monmouth sailed from the Netherlands to England and landed at Lyme Regis in Dorset. He quickly gained the support of local Protestant sympathizers, and he was declared king in different towns of the West Country including Chard and Taunton, in Somerset. A key aspect of the whole affair is that Monmouth's supporters hoped that the Protestant population in other parts of the country would be inspired by his actions and rise up against James II as well. However, this did not transpire the way they had hoped. The rebellion faced numerous obstacles, including a lack of strong leadership, insufficient resources, and the failure to gain the support of a majority of the civilian population. The final battle of the rebellion took place at Sedgemoor on the 6th of July, 1685. Monmouth's forces were defeated by the army led by King James II's commander, Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham, and John Churchill, who later became the Duke of Marlborough. Monmouth was captured a few days after the Battle of Sedgemoor and was taken to the Tower of London. He was subsequently tried for treason and was convicted. On 15 July 1685, he was executed by beheading on Tower Hill. The rebellion's failure led to a series of harsh retributions against those who supported Monmouth, known as the \\"Bloody Assizes\\" presided over by Judge George Jeffreys. The Monmouth Rebellion had significant consequences in the years that followed, as it furthered the religious and political divide in the country. The events also served as a precursor to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when James II was eventually overthrown and replaced by the Protestant King William III of Orange and his wife, Queen Mary II, who were both more favorable to the Protestant population's wishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Why the need for tensor vectors? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPTIONS: I. no II. yes","completion":"I. NO Let's begin by distinguishing between the concepts of a vector and a tensor. A vector is an elementary concept in mathematics and physics. It can be viewed as a directional component that has both magnitude and direction. For instance, velocity is a vector because it defines how fast (magnitude) and in what direction you are moving, while temperature, which just tells you how hot or cold it is (magnitude), is not a vector. In a more specific mathematical framework, a vector is an element of a vector space, which is an algebraic structure formed by a set of elements equipped with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. On the other hand, a tensor extends the concept of a vector to additional dimensions. Like vectors, tensors carry information about magnitude and direction, but while vectors act in a single dimension, tensors can accommodate multiple dimensions. To signify this information, tensors use a matrix notation or a multi-dimensional array of numbers. They encapsulate complex geometric transformations and multi-dimensional physical quantities like stress, strain, and the electromagnetic field. More specifically, in the mathematical field, a tensor belongs in a tensor space: an algebraic structure that extends the notion of a vector space to multiple dimensions. Now, on to the second question - why the need for tensor vectors? We resort to using tensors when dealing with multi-dimensional phenomena or complex transformations. For instance, when we have to represent quantities that involve multiple directions at once, like the stress on a material, a vector wouldn't suffice; a tensor would be required here because the change in material is happening along multiple axes and needs a multi-directional representation, which tensors are adept at capturing. The dimensionality of tensors is indeed key, as tensors allow for the representation and manipulation of complex high-dimensional maps in way vectors cannot. Apart from representing multi-dimensional physical entities, they are also used in fields like machine learning and data science for high-dimensional data manipulation. Therefore, these two questions are not paraphrases of one another. The first question asks for the difference between vector and tensor, while the second one seeks to understand the importance or necessity for tensors in the context of vectors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon.

It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him.

Romanian:","completion":"Acel decret, domnule Președinte, a schimbat regulile jocului pentru o competiție electorală care a început deja și permite celor care au încălcat legea să candideze, fiind readmise în competiția electorală. În acest context, decretul la care faceți referire, domnule Președinte, reprezintă o schimbare semnificativă în cadrul dinamic al unei competiții electorale care era deja în desfășurare în momentul adoptării sale. Modificările aduse normelor și reglementărilor care guvernează procesul competițional au implicații directe și imediate asupra grupurilor politice implicate și a electoratului care participă activ la procesul de vot. Permiteți-mi să subliniez câteva aspecte importante referitoare la efectele pe care acest decret le are asupra dinamicii competiției electorale. În primul rând, schimbarea regulilor în acest mod favorizează candidații care au încălcat în trecut legile și reglementările electorale, dar au fost readmise în competiție datorită decretului. Un astfel de tratament preferențial nu numai că poate crea un precedent periculos pentru viitoarele competiții electorale, dar poate provoca și nemulțumire și frustrare în rândul partidelor politice și candidaților care respectă principiile democratice și integritatea procesului electoral. În al doilea rând, decretul poate afecta și percepția publică asupra legitimității alegerilor și a instituțiilor implicate în organizarea și monitorizarea lor. Prin permiterea accesului la putere al candidaților cu istoric de încălcare a legii, s-ar putea ca încrederea populației în corectitudinea procesului electoral să scadă, iar acest lucru ar avea, în cele din urmă, consecințe asupra participării celor care se află în postura de alege. În concluzie, decretul menționat a adus schimbări semnificative în cadrul competiției electorale și a avut implicații asupra părților interesate implicate, dar și asupra electoratului în ansamblu. Acesta a favorizat candidații care au încălcat legea și a tensionat în continuare competiția electorală, generând nemulțumire și potențial disfuncționalități în sistemul electoral. Este important ca astfel de modificări să fie analizate în detaliu, pentru a se evita consecințele negative și pentru a se asigura că mecanismele democratice își păstrează integritatea și eficiența."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plyometrics incorporate jumping movements and strengthen the muscles. This type of exercise also increases the speed and agility you need for most sports. Do these exercises to help get your body used to quick movements and using a lot of power. You need to land lightly while doing plyometrics so that you catch your weight on the balls of your feet. Roll back to your heel, knees slightly bent and hips straight. You will hop over a cone to increase strength and control of your MCL. Practice doing several sets of 20 reps. Stand with a 6 inch cone to the left and hop to the left over the cone landing softly as described in the plyometrics step. Repeat this with the cone to your right, hopping to the right. Now, jump forward over the cone. Practice jumping backwards over the cone too. Do not snap your knee back to straighten it. Keep your knees stable. You should practice hopping over the cone with one foot, doing 20 reps. This will further increase the power, strength and control you have over your MCL. Hop forward and backward over a 6 inch cone, landing lightly on the balls of your feet and maintaining a slight bend at the knee. Switch feet and practice hopping over the cone with the other leg. Do 20 reps of the scissors jump to increase strength and power. This will help significantly with jumping during sports. Make sure your knees are stable during this exercise, and do not allow your knee to cave in or out. Use your right leg to lunge forward, keeping your knee directly over your ankle. Push with your right foot so your left leg moves into the lunge position. Sprinting trains your knee, ankle and hip to remain stable during sudden movements. This increases strength and agility. Practice shuttle runs regularly to maintain speed, strength and dynamic stability. Start at a cone and sprint forward to a second cone, a short distance away. Run backwards to the third cone and forward to the fourth. Practice going forward and backwards from cone to cone. Diagonal runs are basically shuttle runs that focus on the outside of each leg and foot. This stabilizes the knee, ankle and hip complex. It also increases agility and makes your MCL stronger. Run to a cone placed to your left. You will want to pivot off the left foot as you run to the next cone. Pivot off your right foot to the next cone. Maintain proper form and don't allow your knees to bend inward. Always keep your knees slightly bent so they are directly over the ankle joint. A bounding run involves running across 44 yards. You will start at shorter distances and increase your distance over time with practice. This exercise has multiple benefits, increasing flexibility, strength, power and speed. You will want to begin along the sidelines. When you run, push your knees high up toward your chest. As your legs come down, land on the balls of your feet. Your hip needs to be straight and knees slightly bent.","completion":"This article outlines plyometric exercises, including various hops, jumps, and runs, to increase strength, agility, and control of the MCL for improved sports performance while emphasizing proper form and stable knee positioning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Lieutenant Commander Ken White orders the submarine Tiger Shark to dive to evade an aerial and surface attack. Crewman Boyer begs him to wait for the captain, Commander Josh Rice, still topside, but White refuses, and Rice (his good friend) and the quartermaster are lost. When they resurface shortly afterward, they discover that the war is over. No one other than Boyer, not even the captain's widow and father, blames him.

I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Make it more pigmented and less shiny B. Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have C. Create a strictly plum color and a strictly pearl color D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"B.

Answer: 55\\" LG OLED TV showcased at CES 2012 Question: what is the organic layer in an amoled screen A:","completion":"The organic layer in an AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen refers to a series of thin film layers made of organic molecules that form the crucial light-emitting component within the display technology. To provide a detailed understanding of the organic layer's role and composition, it is essential to delve into the working principles of an AMOLED screen. AMOLED screens consist of various components, including a substrate, anode, cathode, organic layers, and encapsulation layers. The organic layers, in particular, are composed of multiple sub-layers. These include the hole injection layer (HIL), hole transport layer (HTL), emissive layer (EML), electron transport layer (ETL), and electron injection layer (EIL). Each of these layers serves a specific purpose and plays a crucial role in the functioning of the AMOLED screen: 1. Hole Injection Layer (HIL): This layer is crucial for injecting positive charge carriers (holes) into the hole transport layer. It is generally made of materials like poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). 2. Hole Transport Layer (HTL): The HTL is responsible for efficiently transporting the holes from the anode to the emissive layer. Common materials used for HTL are organic compounds like N,N'-Di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-diphenyl-benzidine (NPB) and 4,4'-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (α-NPD). 3. Emissive Layer (EML): The EML is the most critical component, where the actual light emission process takes place. It contains organic molecules responsible for emitting various colors when supplied with energy. The molecules can either be small-molecule phosphorescent or fluorescent dyes (like Alq3, iridium or platinum complexes) or polymer-based materials (like polyfluorene derivatives) to attain the desired emission spectra. 4. Electron Transport Layer (ETL): This layer ensures the efficient transport of electrons from the cathode to the emissive layer. The ETL materials are typically metal chelate compounds like tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) and bathophenanthroline (Bphen). 5. Electron Injection Layer (EIL): Situated adjacent to the cathode, the EIL's primary function is to inject electrons into the electron transport layer. Common materials used for EILs include lithium fluoride (LiF) and cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3). The organic layers play a vital role in determining the overall performance, color gamut, and efficiency of an AMOLED screen. These materials have been extensively researched and optimized to achieve high-quality, thin, flexible, and energy-efficient displays that are increasingly popular in various consumer electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) - Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere - The make-up of the atmosphere changes - Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere - The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy - Human beings cut down trees - Human beings do not re-plant the trees - Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth&#x27;s short term weather - Eventually the long-term climate patterns start to change - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose landscape less susceptible to change such as rocky happens, how will it affect humans burn more fossil fuel. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed involves a landscape that is less susceptible to change, such as a rocky environment. To analyze its effect on the process of climate change due to human activities, we'll consider its direct or indirect impacts. Let's evaluate the steps you mentioned in the process of climate change: 1. Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) 2. Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enters the atmosphere 3. The make-up of the atmosphere changes 4. Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere 5. The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy 6. Human beings cut down trees 7. Human beings do not re-plant the trees 8. Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 9. The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth's short-term weather 10. Eventually, the long-term climate patterns start to change In a rocky landscape, the most significant effect could be observed on steps 6 and 8, where the availability of trees becomes a key factor. A rocky landscape typically has fewer trees, so the capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere decreases. As a result, there may be a more significant accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, it's worth noting that a single rocky landscape will likely have minimal impact on the global climate change process, as it only represents a small fraction of the Earth's total surface area. The direct contribution of this perturbation hypothesis would be quite limited, as it doesn't change the fundamental aspects of human-induced climate change, such as the burning of fossil fuels, emission of greenhouse gases, or modification of the atmosphere. Regarding the indirect effects, human activity in rocky landscapes might not directly influence fossil fuel consumption. However, it could lead to changes in land use patterns. For example, if a rocky landscape is being used for mining activities, it might indirectly contribute to increased fossil fuel extraction and consumption. This would then contribute to climate change by following the same process outlined in the steps 1 through 10. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of a landscape less susceptible to change, like a rocky area, may have some limited direct and indirect effects on the climate change process. Direct effects would mainly pertain to the reduced capacity to absorb CO2 due to fewer trees. Indirect effects could result from changes in land use patterns, such as mining or other activities that contribute to increased fossil fuel consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term \\"conciliation\\" typically indicates the action of mediating between parties in conflict with a view to help them improve their relationship, resolve their differences, or reach a mutual agreement. But while acknowledging this failure, the speaker goes on to point out that not all hope is lost. There is still an opportunity to start anew in building up communication, or a \\"dialogue\\". The act of rebuilding dialogue suggests reestablishing open and honest communication, which can be seen as a positive step towards understanding, cooperation, and potentially, resolution of conflicts. The phrase \\"starting from today\\" adds a sense of immediacy and determination to this intention, indicating that the speaker is ready to begin this process immediately and isn't willing to delay it any further. This phrase carries a strong undertone of optimism, resilience, and a forward-looking perspective despite past setbacks. The speaker acknowledges the failed reconciliation but does not dwell on it, instead focusing on what can still be done to mend the broken relationships or disagreement. This represents a constructive attitude, highlighting the importance of consistent communication and dialogue in resolving disagreements and fostering understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other, as both are asking about the best methods to fix trackpad issues on an Apple MacBook. To provide a detailed and long answer: The Apple MacBook trackpad is an essential input device that helps users navigate and interact with their laptops. However, it can sometimes experience various issues, such as unresponsiveness, incorrect gestures, or erratic cursor movement. To diagnose and fix these problems, apply the following solutions: 1. Check for macOS updates: Outdated software can often cause compatibility issues with the trackpad. Ensure that your MacBook is running the latest macOS version by going to System Preferences > Software Update. If an update is available, follow the instructions to download and install it. 2. Clean the trackpad: Dirt and debris can interfere with trackpad functionality. Clean the trackpad surface gently with a soft, lint-free cloth. Avoid using alcohol or other harsh cleaning chemicals that might damage the surface. 3. Adjust trackpad sensitivity: If your trackpad is not responding as expected, you might need to adjust its sensitivity settings. Go to System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click. Adjust the tracking speed slider until you find a comfortable setting. 4. Reset the System Management Controller (SMC): The SMC controls various low-level functions, including the operation of the trackpad. Resetting it might help resolve trackpad issues. To reset the SMC on a MacBook with a removable battery, shut down the laptop, remove the battery, press and hold the power button for 5 seconds, then re-insert the battery and power up. For MacBooks with non-removable batteries, follow these steps: shut down the laptop, press and hold Shift+Control+Option and the power button for 10 seconds, then release and power up. 5. Reset the Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM): NVRAM stores settings such as sound volume, display resolution, and mouse preferences. To reset the NVRAM, power down your MacBook, press the power button, then immediately press and hold Command+Option+P+R. Release the keys after about 20 seconds, once the MacBook restarts. Note that you might need to reconfigure some system settings afterward. 6. Disable Force Click and haptic feedback: These features can cause trackpad issues on some MacBooks. Go to System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click and uncheck the Force Click and haptic feedback option. 7. Check for hardware issues: If the above solutions do not resolve the problem, your MacBook might have a hardware issue. This can include a swollen battery, a damaged trackpad cable, or other internal faults. In such cases, consult an authorized Apple service provider or visit an Apple Store for professional help. In conclusion, MacBook trackpad problems can often be fixed using various troubleshooting methods, such as macOS updates, cleaning, sensitivity adjustments, or system resets. If these approaches do not provide satisfactory results, seek assistance from Apple professionals to diagnose and repair potential hardware problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"Three men were involved in a light hearted discussion.\\", does this mean that \\"Three people are arguing over something\\"?","completion":"No, \\"Three men were involved in a light-hearted discussion\\" does not necessarily mean that \\"Three people are arguing over something.\\" Although both scenarios involve three individuals conversing or communicating, the tone, intention, and nature of the interactions are quite distinct. In the first phrase, where \\"Three men were involved in a light-hearted discussion,\\" the word \\"light-hearted\\" suggests that the conversation was relaxed, fun, and easygoing. They could have been talking about their favorite movies, sharing funny stories or anecdotes, or discussing any topic that carries positive and enjoyable emotions. The emphasis here is on the convivial atmosphere, where no heated debates or serious disagreements are present. It generally implies that the participants were enjoying each other's company, and the conversation flowed with harmony and good spirits. On the other hand, the phrase \\"Three people are arguing over something\\" suggests that the individuals are engaged in a dispute or disagreement. An argument often involves differing opinions, conflict, or opposition, which create a more tense and possibly hostile atmosphere. There could be raised voices, interruptions, or strong emotions on display as the participants express their viewpoints. This scenario shows that the conversation has escalated from a friendly discussion to a more adversarial or contentious situation. In summary, while both scenarios involve conversations between three individuals, the defining factors that differentiate them are the tone, intention, and nature of the interactions. A light-hearted discussion suggests a warm, enjoyable, and friendly atmosphere, whereas an argument indicates disagreement, confrontation, or conflict within the conversation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

ABC may lose Australia Network Another signal has emerged that the Abbott government intends to strip the ABC of its international broadcasting service – the Australia Network – in a significant concession to Rupert Murdoch and to conservative commentators critical of public broadcasting. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has been preparing the public ground since opposition for the ABC to lose its Australia Network regional broadcasting service, which it was awarded by the previous Labor government after a bitterly contested process. In January Bishop criticised the quality of the programming on the Australia Network, and argued it was not serving Australia’s regional interests as “a tool of public diplomacy”. The Australian newspaper reported on Thursday that the service was likely to be scrapped in the May budget as a savings measure. The commission of audit established by the government will also run the ruler over other ABC services. The Sky News network lost out to the ABC in the Australia Network tender process carried out under the previous Labor government. The multimillion-dollar tender was botched due to sharp divisions within Labor over whether the ABC or Sky should emerge with the regional service. Sky, a broadcaster part owned by BSkyB – a British company controlled by 21st Century Fox, which is a sister company to Murdoch’s Australian publishing arm, News Corp – has made no secret of its fury about that process, and has lobbied the Coalition to have the ABC’s contract dumped. In its aborted media reform package in early 2013, Labor did manage to legislate a provision where only the ABC or its associated companies could provide “commonwealth funded international broadcasting services”. It was a means of trying to lock in the ABC’s position regarding the Australian Network after any change of government. The reform suggests the Coalition would need further legislation if it wanted not to bank the saving, but clear the field for a commercial broadcaster. Whether the ABC would need to be compensated for the dumped contract is unclear. The acting opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, said she did not watch a lot of the Australia Network because she lived in Australia, but believed the channel was providing “a very valuable service” in projecting Australian values to the region. She said the government was \\"proposing to cut almost a quarter of a billion dollars\\" through the axing of the Australia Network contract, despite signalling before the election that it would not reduce funding to the ABC. Asked whether the Australia Network should reflect support for Australia to achieve the aim of soft diplomacy, Plibersek said freedom of speech was a worthy value to promote. “I'm very happy for the world to see that in Australia you can stand up, you can criticise the government, the government can respond and everybody goes home that night safe and sound,” she said. The Greens leader, Christine Milne, said the Australia Network did an \\"outstanding job\\" and it would be \\"a very bad mistake\\" for Abbott to abandon the service. In addition to bruised feelings over the Australia Network process, the Murdoch-owned News Corp is also campaigning to have the ABC pushed out of digital news services. The ABC’s online content is offered free to readers and viewers, and News Corp is one of several publishers arguing the national broadcaster’s ongoing digital expansion threatens their business. News Corp faces further commercial pressure in 2014. The tabloids will face competition in Australia for the first time in many years with the entry of the British-owned Daily Mail – one of the most successful digital news sites in the world. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, launched a strong public criticism of the ABC on Wednesday during a radio appearance on 2GB in Sydney. Abbott took issue with the ABC's reporting of claims by asylum seekers of mistreatment at the hands of the Australian navy. The prime minister suggested the national broadcaster needed to be more patriotic, and should be inclined to give the navy the benefit of the doubt. The ABC has taken steps to check the accuracy of the claims made by the asylum seekers, and an email from an ABC researcher made its way into the public domain indicating that some editorial executives doubted the allegations were accurate. This email has given impetus to the broadcaster’s critics who contend the story should not have been broadcast. A spokeswoman for the national broadcaster said: “In a climate where official information about asylum seeker operations is scarce and hard to come by, the ABC makes no apologies for seeking as much information as it can from as many sources as it can to either verify or disprove the allegations at the centre of the story.” Abbott also reaffirmed his concerns about the ABC's collaboration with Guardian Australia on the story that revealed Australian spy agencies’ past efforts to target the phones of the Indonesian president, his wife and inner circle. Those disclosures were based on documents provided by the former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. Abbott’s intervention was amplified in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph newspaper on Thursday with strong page one treatment. The paper quoted Abbott’s key business adviser, and former ABC chairman Maurice Newman as saying: “In relation to the navy, [the ABC has] given credence to the idea that the navy may well have tortured people … 99% of Australians would think that's highly unlikely. I think [the allegations] are inimical to Australia's best interests. “It casts doubt on Australia's reputation and I think it's regrettable.” The communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, however, launched a defence of the ABC. He told Fairfax Media that politicians may have issues with ABC content, but could not tell media outlets what to write. “What's the alternative … the editor-in-chief [of the ABC] becomes the prime minister?” Turnbull said. “Politicians, whether prime ministers or communications ministers, will often be unhappy with the ABC … but you can't tell them what to write.'” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The Australian government might take away the Australia Network from the ABC, which is a way for the ABC to share their shows with other countries, especially nearby ones. Many people think that the government is doing this because of some disagreements in the past, and to save money. The Sky News network, which has some connections to a big company called News Corp, might want to take over the Australia Network from the ABC. The ABC might need to be paid back some money if their contract is taken away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This new format featured a 7-inch diameter record with a large center hole, offering an alternative to the larger 12-inch LP records. The 45 rpm records were designed to be used with a specific player that included a changing mechanism, allowing multiple discs to be stacked and played one after another, similar to the conventional changer handling 78 rpm records. The 45 rpm records provided a shorter playing time per side compared to LPs, with a total playing time of around eight minutes. This meant that longer works, such as symphonies, needed to be released across multiple 45s, rather than a single LP. However, RCA claimed that their new high-speed changer offered such swift side breaks that the interruptions were either inaudible or inconsequential to the listening experience. These early 45 rpm records were made using either vinyl or polystyrene as the material. In summary, RCA released the 45 rpm single format as their competitive response to Columbia's LP records, offering consumers an alternative record format with shorter playing times and a specific player that enabled fast and easy switching between sides and records."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given: 1. x * y = 120 2. x^2 + y^2 = 289 We need to find the value of x + y. From the first equation, we can express y as 120/x. Now, we can substitute this into the second equation: x^2 + (120/x)^2 = 289 x^4 + 14400 = 289x^2 x^4 - 289x^2 + 14400 = 0 Let's use substitution: z = x^2, so the equation becomes: z^2 - 289z + 14400 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, but in this case, we are lucky to have a factorable equation: (z - 144)(z - 100) = 0 So, we have two possible values for z: z = 144 and z = 100. Now we can find the values for x and y: Case 1: z = 144 x^2 = 144, so x = ±12 (because x can be positive or negative). y^2 = 100, so y = ±10 (because y can be positive or negative).

Geoff Tate (born Jeffrey Wayne Tate, January 14, 1959; he later changed his first name to Geoffery or Geoffrey) is a German-born American singer and musician. He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensryche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. While Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensryche) at a local rock festival. After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs. Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensryche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensryche in 2012. The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future. The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song \\"The Lady Wore Black\\", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensryche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensryche's permanent lead singer. Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left. Queensryche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983, with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums. EMI re-released the EP, Queensryche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensryche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensryche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre. Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005-2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensryche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name. It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensryche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.

Freedom from Want was published with an essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\". In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America. In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty.

I have irregular cycles. Will a pregnancy test work the day after? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available options: * no * yes","completion":"To address your questions: 1. How soon after my period can I take a pregnancy test? I have irregular cycles. To determine the best time to take a pregnancy test when you have irregular cycles, you need to consider the following steps: Step 1: Understand the role of hCG Pregnancy tests detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine, which is produced by the developing placenta after implantation occurs. hCG levels typically double every 48 to 72 hours in the early stages of pregnancy. Step 2: Determine your cycle length Since you mentioned that you have irregular cycles, it's essential to observe your cycles for a couple of months to identify your average cycle length. Step 3: Wait at least two weeks after ovulation Ovulation usually occurs halfway through your cycle. However, if your cycles are irregular, this might be hard to pinpoint. Observing fertility signs, such as basal body temperature or cervical mucus, or using ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) can help estimate your ovulation date. Waiting at least two weeks after ovulation allows enough time for hCG levels to rise to detectable levels. Step 4: Test on the day of your expected period Take a pregnancy test on the day of your expected period, as this is when hCG levels are typically high enough to be detected by most home pregnancy tests. For irregular cycles, this might vary. In conclusion, the ideal time to take a pregnancy test when you have irregular cycles is at least two weeks after ovulation or on the day of your expected period. 2. Will a pregnancy test work the day after? If by \\"the day after,\\" you mean the day after your period ends, it's unlikely that a pregnancy test would provide accurate results. This is because hCG levels are usually not high enough to be detected by most home pregnancy tests so soon after your period. It's essential to wait at least two weeks after ovulation or until the day of your expected period to ensure more reliable results. 3. Please tell me if those questions are the same. *no These questions are not the same. The first question is about the best time to take a pregnancy test when having irregular cycles, while the second question asks if a pregnancy test will work the day after a period ends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Paragraph: Dutch scientist Mark Post displays samples of in-vitro meat, or cultured meat grown in a laboratory, at the University of Maastricht November 9, 2011. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “Cultured meat” — burgers or sausages grown in laboratory Petri dishes rather than made from slaughtered livestock — could be the answer that feeds the world, saves the environment and spares the lives of millions of animals, they say. Granted, it may take a while to catch on. And it won’t be cheap. The first lab-grown hamburger will cost around 250,000 euros (345,000) to produce, according to Mark Post, a vascular biologist at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands, who hopes to unveil such a delicacy soon. Experts say the meat’s potential for saving animals’ lives, land, water, energy and the planet itself could be enormous. “The first one will be a proof of concept, just to show it’s possible,” Post told Reuters in a telephone interview from his Maastricht lab. “I believe I can do this in the coming year.” It may sound and look like some kind of imitation, but in-vitro or cultured meat is a real animal flesh product, just one that has never been part of a complete, living animal — quite different from imitation meat or meat substitutes aimed at vegetarians and made from vegetable proteins like soy. Using stem cells harvested from leftover animal material from slaughterhouses, Post nurtures them with a feed concocted of sugars, amino acids, lipids, minerals and all other nutrients they need to grow in the right way. So far he has produced whitish pale muscle-like strips, each of them around 2.5 cm (1 inch) long, less than a centimeter wide and so thin as to be almost see-through. Pack enough of these together — probably around 3,000 of them in layers — throw in a few strips of lab-grown fat, and you have the world’s first “cultured meat” burger, he says. “This first one will be grown in an academic lab, by highly trained academic staff,” he said. “It’s hand-made and it’s time and labor-intensive, that’s why it’s so expensive to produce.” Not to mention a little unappetizing. Since Post’s in-vitro meat contains no blood, it lacks color. At the moment, it looks a bit like the flesh of scallops, he says. Like all muscle, these lab-grown strips also need to be exercised so they can grow and strengthen rather than waste away. To do this Post exploits the muscles’ natural tendency to contract and stretches them between Velcro tabs in the Petri dish to provide resistance and help them build up strength. Supporters of the idea of man-made meat, such as Stellan Welin, a bioethicist at Linkoping University in Sweden, say this is no less appealing than mass-producing livestock in factory farms where growth hormones and antibiotics are commonly used to boost yields and profits. And conventional meat production is also notoriously inefficient. For every 15 grams of edible meat, you need to feed the animals on around 100 grams of vegetable protein, an increasingly unsustainable equation. All this means finding new ways of producing meat is essential if we are to feed the enormous and ever-growing demand for it across the world, Welin told Reuters in an interview. “Of course you could do it by being vegetarian or eating less meat,” he said. “But the trends don’t seem to be going that way. With cultured meat we can be more conservative — people can still eat meat, but without causing so much damage.” According to the World Health Organization, annual meat production is projected to increase from 218 million tonnes in 1997-1999 to 376 million tonnes by 2030, and demand from a growing world population is seen rising further beyond that. “Current livestock meat production is just not sustainable,” says Post. “Not from an ecological point of view, and neither from a volume point of view. Right now we are using more than 50 percent of all our agricultural land for livestock. “It’s simple maths. We have to come up with alternatives.” According to a 2006 report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, industrialized agriculture contributes on a “massive scale” to climate change, air pollution, land degradation, energy use, deforestation and biodiversity decline. The report, entitled Livestock’s Long Shadow, said the meat industry contributes about 18 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, and this proportion is expected to grow as consumers in fast-developing countries like China and India eat more meat. Hanna Tuomisto, who conducted a study into the relative environmental impacts of various types of meat, including lamb, pork, beef and cultured meat, said the lab-grown stuff has by far the least impact on the environment. Her analysis, published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal earlier this year, found that growing our favorite meats in-vitro would use 35 to 60 percent less energy, emit 80 to 95 percent less greenhouse gas and use around 98 percent less land than conventionally produced animal meat. “We are not saying that we could, or would necessarily want to, replace conventional meat with its cultured counterpart right now,” Tuomisto, who led the research at Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, said in a telephone interview. But she said cultured meat “could be part of the solution to feeding the world’s growing population and at the same time cutting emissions and saving both energy and water.” While experts in the field agree that within several years, it may be possible to produce in-vitro meat in a processed form — like sausages or chicken nuggets — producing more animal-like products such as pork chops or steaks could be a lot more complex and may take many more years to develop. Post, who is financed by an anonymous private funder keen to see the Dutch scientist succeed, hopes to hand the world its first man-made hamburger by August or September next year, but for the moment he admits what he has grown is a long way from a mouth-watering meal. He hasn’t yet sampled his own creation, but reviews from others are not great. A Russian TV reporter who came to his lab tried one of the strips and was unimpressed. “It’s not very tasty yet,” Post said. “That’s not a trivial thing and it needs to be worked on.” But with the right amounts and right types of fat, perhaps a little lab-grown blood to give it color and iron, Post is confident he can make his Petri dish meat look and taste as good as the real thing. He also hopes the ability to tweak and change things will mean scientists will ultimately be able to make meat healthier — with less saturated and more polyunsaturated fat, for example, or more nutrients. “The idea is that since we are now producing it in the lab, we can play with all these variables and we can eventually hopefully turn it in a way that produces healthier meat,” he said. “Whereas in a cow or a pig, you have very limited variables to play with.” (1 = 0.727 Euros) Claim: Petri dish to dinner plate, in-vitro meat coming soon.

Answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Two songwriters, Frank P. Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\".

Animal vocalizations serve a variety of purposes and are essential for their communication and survival. These vocalizations can be heard in a wide range of species, from birds and mammals to reptiles, amphibians, and insects. In each species, these sounds play a crucial role in various aspects of their life, such as mating, bonding, warning others about potential threats, and marking territory. Here is a detailed overview of the roles animal vocalizations play in communication and survival. 1. Mating and reproductive purposes: Many species use vocalizations to attract a mate and indicate they are available for breeding. For example, male birds often sing elaborate and distinctive songs to advertise their availability to females and show off their fitness. Frogs and toads also make specific calls during mating seasons to locate and choose their partners. These vocalizations can convey information about the caller's age, size, and health, allowing potential mates to select the most suitable partner for successful reproduction. 2. Social bonding: Vocalizations play a crucial role in establishing and maintaining social bonds between conspecifics (members of the same species). Some bird species engage in duets or group singing to reinforce their social bonds, such as when family members join together in a chorus. In mammals, the mother, offspring, and other group members may stay in contact through vocalizations, such as a baby elephant's trumpeting or a chimpanzee's call. These sounds help maintain social structure and group cohesion, contributing to the overall well-being and survival of the species. 3. Territory defense and resource guarding: Many animals use vocalizations to signal their presence and ownership of a specific territory. By vocalizing, they can deter rivals from entering and help prevent potential conflicts. For example, a male songbird may sing to proclaim its territory and prevent other males from entering. Similarly, wolves and other canid species use howls to warn off conspecifics from claiming their hunting grounds or den sites. 4. Alarm calls and predator avoidance: One of the most crucial functions of animal vocalizations is the ability to communicate potential threats to other members of their group. These alarm calls serve as a warning system, helping animals protect themselves and their group members from predators or other dangers. For instance, vervet monkeys have specific calls for different predator types, such as eagles, snakes, and big cats, allowing them to appropriately react to the threat at hand. 5. Foraging and food search: Vocalizations can also aid animals in finding food. For example, certain species of bats use echolocation, emitting a series of high-frequency sounds that bounce off objects in their environment. By listening to the returning echoes, bats can locate and track their prey with precision, which is essential for catching insect prey during flight. 6. Navigation and orientation: Animal vocalizations can sometimes act as auditory landmarks to navigate and stay oriented in their environment. This is especially crucial for nocturnal species when visual cues are limited. A notable example is nocturnal birds, like the nightingale, which depend on their song patterns to position, time their activities, and orient themselves in their habitat. In conclusion, animal vocalizations serve as a fundamental aspect of communication and survival for a range of species. These sounds contribute to the success of mating, social bonding, territory defense, predator avoidance, foraging, and navigation. As a result, vocalizations have evolved into complex and intricate signals, allowing animals to effectively respond to their environment's challenges and thrive within their ecological niches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Gary envied Bill because he was rich. Who is \\"he\\" in this prior sentence?","completion":"The pronoun \\"he\\" in the sentence \\"Gary envied Bill because he was rich\\" refers to Bill. This interpretation is based on how English grammar typically works. In English, the pronoun \\"he\\" is used to refer back to a previously mentioned noun, which in many cases is the noun nearest to the pronoun. This is known as the principle of proximity. Here, the nearest noun to \\"he\\" is \\"Bill,\\" so it would be logical to assume that \\"he\\" refers to \\"Bill.\\" Moreover, the context also supports this interpretation. The sentence describes a cause-and-effect relationship. Gary envied Bill because of something - in this case, because \\"he\\" was rich. It is more logical to assume that Gary envied Bill because of something related to Bill himself. So, When we say \\"he was rich,\\" we are most likely talking about Bill being rich. If \\"he\\" were intended to refer to Gary, the sentence would mean Gary was rich and he envied Bill, which doesn't quite make sense because people typically experience envy towards those who posses something they don't have. However, please note that while this interpretation is the most likely, there are some cases in English where this pattern doesn't hold. The intended meaning can also depend on the wider context in which the sentence is used, not visible in this example. Only limited information can reduce the accuracy of conclusions. But based on the information given, \\"he\\" in this sentence most likely refers to Bill."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Complete the following sentence. Sleeping in a loft bed was not a good idea for Samantha but it was for Elena because","completion":"Sleeping in a loft bed was not a good idea for Samantha but it was for Elena because their varying degrees of discomfort with heights affected their abilities to adapt and feel at ease in their particular sleeping arrangements. Samantha, who had always been uncomfortable with heights, found it exceedingly difficult to adjust to her new loft bed. Her heart would race every time she climbed up and down the ladder to her sleeping area, and her anxiety kept her from having a restful night's sleep. The loft bed, which was supposed to provide extra space and efficiency in her room, soon became a constant source of unease for her, ultimately defeating its intended purpose. Moreover, Samantha's fear of heights intensified when she was trying to go to sleep. The bed's elevation caused her to feel exposed, vulnerable, and at risk of falling even though the loft bed was equipped with safety rails. This psychological insecurity prevented Samantha from embracing the benefits of her new sleeping arrangement. Consequently, her overall well-being and daily functioning were negatively impacted due to her sleep deprivation caused by her fear-induced insomnia. On the other hand, Elena did not share the same level of discomfort with heights that her friend Samantha did. Despite a slight unease when it came to elevated spaces, Elena was more adaptable and willing to face her fears in order to enjoy the advantages that a loft bed provides. Not only did she find the additional space beneath the bed to be a marvelous bonus for extra storage or a cozy workspace, but Elena also came to appreciate the loft bed as a unique and fun feature in her room. Over time, Elena's mild discomfort with heights began to subside as she grew more accustomed to her loft bed. She found that climbing up and down the ladder actually provided her with a sense of adventure and an opportunity to confront her mild phobia head-on. Consequently, Elena was able to overcome her fears and embrace her sleeping arrangement, enjoying restful nights of sleep and a room layout that was both functional and appealing. In conclusion, while Samantha's significant discomfort with heights caused her to have persistent anxiety that interfered with her ability to sleep soundly and appreciate the benefits of a loft bed, Elena's milder unease allowed her to adjust and ultimately derive enjoyment from her unique sleeping arrangement. These contrasting experiences demonstrate the importance of considering individual preferences and fears when selecting furniture that is intended to fulfill both practical and personal needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To make a large living room more livable and less intimidating, create two or more distinct sections. Backless or low-backed sofas, especially L-shaped ones, are excellent for dividing a room without blocking line of sight or creating odd, tall distractions in the center of the space. Dividing a large rectangular space into two squares often improves its appearance, as square spaces are almost always more appealing to the eye. You can use one or more sections for other purposes as though they weren't part of your living room, although the overall color scheme should match. An extra large ottoman is better than a coffee table for making a large space between couches or chairs feel cozy. A small couch will feel out of place in a large room, so replace a larger one or buy a second matching one and angle them slightly toward each other to form one side of your furniture arrangement. If all your paintings or wall hangings are small, place them in groups to make a large, pleasing arrangement that fills visual space. Tapestries tend to be larger and cheaper than paintings. An indoor potted plant you're willing to care for can add color and visual interest where there used to be empty space. Decorative figurines, sculptures, or ceramics draw attention to a smaller scale. Don't clutter the table so much it becomes unusable, however; one to four pieces on each one is sufficient. If you're interested in a complete redesign, using rich colors, wainscoting, or multiple colors to make the space less bare. Drawing attention to the walls makes your guests feel encompassed by the space in an intimate environment. Summary:","completion":"To make a large living room more inviting, create distinct sections using low-backed sofas, opt for large ottomans over coffee tables, and utilize larger artwork or indoor plants to fill visual space."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President.

Options: - melts - wet clothes - move mountains - thin blood - take several forms The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Take several forms\\" Water can undergo phase transitions at various temperatures, resulting in it taking different forms. These forms can be classified mainly into three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor or steam). At low temperatures below 0°C (32°F), water turns into ice, which is its solid state. Conversely, when water is heated above 100°C (212°F), it converts into steam or water vapor, which is its gaseous state. Water's liquid state is the form in which we're most accustomed to seeing water and occurs across a range of temperatures from the melting point of ice up to the boiling point of water.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A group of African children observing and clapping.\\" if \\"Children in Africa clapping.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"A group of African children observing and clapping\\" if given the information \\"Children in Africa clapping.\\" However, the original statement does not provide complete information to accurately make this conclusion. There are a few assumptions made in the conclusion and additional information that could be explicitly stated. In order to make a more accurate conclusion, one would need further context and details about the situation. Firstly, one must assume that the children in Africa are indeed part of a group. The original statement does not explicitly mention that the children are together in a group. It is possible that they are individually clapping in separate locations or dispersed among others. Therefore, one must only infer that the children are indeed a group. Secondly, the conclusion states that the children are not only clapping but also observing. This information is not provided in the original statement. The children may be clapping for various reasons, including excitement, appreciation, or encouragement. It might be appropriate to associate clapping with observing an event or performance, but the original statement does not explicitly mention this. One must consider that the children could be clapping as part of a game, song, or cultural activity unrelated to observation. Lastly, the term \\"African children\\" implies that the children are of African descent, not just located in Africa. It is important to acknowledge that the continent of Africa is home to diverse populations, including immigrants, and has a rich tapestry of cultural differences. The children might not necessarily be of African descent, even though they are in Africa at the time of clapping. The original statement does not provide sufficient information to conclude their specific ethnic or cultural background. In summary, while it is possible to conclude that \\"A group of African children observing and clapping\\" based on the information \\"Children in Africa clapping,\\" there are several assumptions made and additional details that need to be explicitly stated for a more accurate interpretation. To reach a more informed conclusion, one would require further context and specifics about the children, their location, the reason for clapping, and their cultural background."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The information provided is likely about the professional rugby league player named Dean Parata. This conclusion can be reached due to the fact that the source given specifically refers to him on the rugbyleagueproject.org website. Born on October 4, 1991, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, Parata evidently embarked on his professional career in Italy in the year 2013. As an athlete who plays rugby, his physique is also mentioned. He weighs 80 kg and stands at 180 cm tall, which is standard for many professional players in this physically demanding sport. Furthermore, the term \\"hk\\" as position refers to the hooker role in rugby, indicating that Parata is a hooker – a key role typically responsible for dictating play between forwards and backs during the game. This is also in line with the information known about Parata's professional playing career. In terms of his performance, he evidently did not score any tries, field goals, or points during the period represented by these statistics, which could be either a specific season or over his entire career. This is reflected by the values being set at 0 for \\"triesa\\", \\"fieldgoalsa\\", \\"goalsa\\", and \\"pointsa\\". Additionally, \\"appearancesa\\", represents the number of games that Parata took part in, which is noted as being 3 according to the provided data. Furthermore, the keyword \\"new\\" is stated as \\"yes\\", but without context, it's hard to decipher what exactly this refers to. It might mean that he has newly joined a team, or that the data set provided is recent at the time it was recorded. Nonetheless, without further information, this remains unclear. In conclusion, considering the source link's information and all the detailed input, it is safe to assume that the details provided above are about Dean Parata, the rugby player who was born in 1991 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, who started playing professional rugby in Italy in 2013."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

BEIJING, China (Reuters) -- A panda once believed to be male and sent to Japan to breed with a female without success gave birth to twin cubs this week, state media reported on Thursday. An estimated 1,600 wild pandas live in nature reserves in China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The panda, \\"Jinzhu\\", gave birth to two female cubs on Monday at the Wolong Nature Reserve in the mountainous southwestern province of Sichuan, 11 years after being declared male at birth in 1996, Xinhua news agency said. \\"Jinzhu was believed to be male owing to her inconspicuous secondary sex characteristic and behavior,\\" the agency quoted Wei Rongping, assistant director of the reserve's research center, as saying. Jinzhu was sent to Japan in 2000 to mate with a female, the report said. \\"When the pandas showed complete disinterest, experts decided to turn to artificial insemination, leading to the discovery that Jinzhu had no penis,\\" it added. Jinzhu was sent back to China in 2002, with experts arguing the panda was either a hermaphrodite or had \\"undeveloped\\" sexual organs. \\"The penis of an adult panda is only about 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) long,\\" Xinhua quoted Li Deshen, a panda expert, as saying, as a possible reason for the mix-up. It was not until 2005 that scientists discovered nine-year-old Jinzhu's ovaries were positioned in the wrong place, and gave her a two-hour operation to make her a \\"normal girl\\", Xinhua said.

Question: How will an increase in prey affect the predation rate (more preying) and the second effect mentioned (fewer hiding places for animals)? Let's perform a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: An increase in prey can be attributed to factors such as reproduction or migration. As the prey population increases, predators might have an easier time finding food. Step 2: The second effect mentioned - the animals having fewer places to hide - has already occurred due to the forest fires. If there are more prey in the area, it could further lead to the concentration of the remaining animals. Step 3: With more prey available and a higher concentration of animals, predators will likely have even easier access to their food sources.
