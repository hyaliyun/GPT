One is sterilisation, in which highly valued assets are sold at the same time that the weaker assets are purchased, which keeps the money supply neutral. Another technique is simply to accept the bad assets as long-term collateral (as opposed to short-term repo swaps) to be held until their market value stabilises. This would imply, as a quid pro quo, adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived value of the assets. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How can weaker states improve the surface value of their assets?","completion":"Weaker states can improve the surface value of their assets through various strategies and policy adjustments aimed at enhancing the overall economic stability and competitiveness of the country. Some of these strategies include: 1. Implementing Structural Reforms: Weaker states need to adopt and implement structural reforms designed to stimulate economic growth, increase productivity and competitiveness, and foster a conducive business environment. These reforms may include liberalizing labor and product markets, improving the regulatory framework, reducing barriers to entry, and promoting competition. 2. Strengthening Fiscal Policies: Prudent fiscal management is crucial for improving the perceived value of assets in weaker states. This involves prioritizing public spending on infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social security, as well as improving revenue collection and minimizing budget deficits. In addition, adopting countercyclical fiscal policies can help lessen economic volatility. 3. Encouraging Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): By creating an investor-friendly environment, weaker states can attract FDI that boosts their economy, creates jobs, and transfers technological know-how. This can be achieved through policy measures such as reducing bureaucratic hurdles, providing tax incentives, and ensuring legal protection for investors. 4. Promoting Export-led Growth: Weaker states can focus on improving their export capabilities by identifying and fostering niche industries and sectors with comparative advantages, enhancing the quality of their products, and strengthening global market access. 5. Developing a Skilled Workforce: Investing in education and vocational training programs ensures a skilled and productive workforce, which is necessary for economic growth and competitiveness. This will also improve the perceived value of assets, as investors recognize the potential for future growth. 6. Ensuring Macroeconomic Stability: A stable macroeconomic environment with low and predictable inflation, sustainable public debt levels, and a stable exchange rate is vital for improving the value of assets. Weaker states need to adopt appropriate monetary and fiscal policies to achieve this stability. 7. Enhancing the Financial Sector: Weaker states can improve their financial sector by ensuring transparency, enforcing prudential regulations, and promoting good governance practices. This will not only help in improving the perception of their assets but also pave the way for the efficient allocation of resources. 8. Fostering Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): PPPs can play a critical role in improving the surface value of assets by leveraging private sector investment and expertise in the development of infrastructure projects and the provision of public services. 9. Improving Institutional Quality: Improving the quality of institutions is essential for enhancing investor confidence and the value of assets. This can be achieved by promoting good governance, strengthening the rule of law, and fighting corruption. By implementing these strategies, weaker states can improve the surface value of their assets, attract investment, and achieve higher levels of economic growth and social development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Or does it matter at all? Recent research suggests that one diet isn't any better than the other.A few weeks before the water study,another concluded that lowfat and lowcarbohydrate diets tied in weight loss.While the lowcarbohydrate dieters did show a slight increase in good cholesterol and a reduction in blood pressure,there was not much difference in the dieters'weight loss.The point here is that the person had to stick to the diet.What helps a person see a diet through? It could be body type. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,as reported byTimemagazine,found that body shape is the key to which diet a person will be able to stick with.Apples are people who carry most of their weight above the belt,while pears carry their weight around their hips .Apple types were more likely to be highinsulin secretors who respond more strongly to carbohydrates in their bodies.They lost the most weight on a lowcarbohydrate diet.Pears were lowinsulin secretors who lost the same amount of weight on both diets.Unstable insulin levels can create stronger hunger senses,causing the apple types to go off their diet plans. All of these studies again come down to choosing the diet that helps you eat less.The bodytype diet does make some sense as men are more likely to be apple types,with larger stomachs,and tend to do well on higherprotein diets,while women,who tend to carry weight around their hips,find themselves drawn to the lowfat diets.The reality is if a diet is failing you try another one.A plan you can't,or won't,stick to will never work,no matter what the research says.

Q: What was Nigeria's infant mortality rate as of 2010?","completion":"As of 2010, Nigeria's infant mortality rate was 8.4 deaths per 1,000 live births. This indicates the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births occurring in the same year. The infant mortality rate is a vital statistic that helps to gauge the overall health of a country, as it reflects factors such as access to quality healthcare, sanitation, and nutrition. It is important to note that Nigeria has made progress in addressing infant mortality in recent years. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Nigeria has been working on several initiatives to improve healthcare infrastructure and access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas. One key strategy has been the scale-up of integrated community case management of childhood illnesses, which allows community health workers to diagnose and treat common childhood illnesses like malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea. Additionally, Nigeria has been working to improve immunization coverage rates, which can help prevent many childhood illnesses and deaths. Another important effort in reducing infant mortality in Nigeria is focusing on maternal health. When mothers have access to prenatal care, skilled birth attendants, and adequate nutrition during pregnancy, their likelihood of having a healthy delivery and a healthy newborn increases greatly. Despite the challenges Nigeria faces in improving its healthcare system and addressing widespread poverty, the country is committed to taking necessary steps to reduce infant mortality and improve the overall health of its population. By continuing to invest in healthcare infrastructure, social services, and education, Nigeria can further reduce this rate and work towards a healthier future for its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Article: Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

I read this background article the other day: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. I am facing a new situation today: Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Answer:","completion":"Andy is the friend who didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. From the given background information, we learn that statins are a class of drugs known to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. By inhibiting this enzyme, statins help lower cholesterol levels in the blood, which in turn reduces the risk of atherosclerosis. This is particularly relevant for individuals with high cholesterol levels. In the new situation, we are introduced to two friends, Ben and Andy, both of whom have high cholesterol levels. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, and based on the background information, it is likely that this medication is a statin, which affects the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. On the other hand, Andy did not visit his doctor due to carelessness, which implies that he did not receive any medication to address his high cholesterol levels. Consequently, since he did not take any cholesterol-lowering drug, Andy is the friend who did not experience changes in his HMG-CoA reductase levels. It is important to note that the action of statins on individuals is influenced by their genetic background, as mentioned in the background article. This can lead to varying levels of efficacy in reducing cholesterol levels. Nevertheless, since Andy did not take any such medication, he remains the answer to the question."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How do SIMD computers perform the same operation on multiple data points?\\" Context: \\"Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously. Graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"SIMD computers, or Single Instruction Multiple Data computers, perform the same operation on multiple data points by utilizing parallel processing techniques. They take advantage of specialized hardware and instruction sets that are designed to efficiently operate on multiple data points simultaneously. In SIMD computers, each ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is capable of performing arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices. Vectors and matrices are essentially data structures that hold multiple data points. When a SIMD instruction is executed, it directs the ALU to perform the same operation on all the elements within a vector or matrix concurrently. This means that the same operation, such as addition or multiplication, is applied to all the data points at the same time. This parallel processing approach significantly improves the performance and efficiency of SIMD computers when handling tasks that involve large amounts of data, such as graphics processing, scientific simulations, and digital signal processing. By simultaneously processing multiple data points with a single instruction, SIMD computers can achieve much higher throughput and performance compared to scalar architectures, which process single data points with individual instructions. In summary, SIMD computers perform the same operation on multiple data points by using specialized hardware and parallel processing techniques that allow them to operate on vectors and matrices efficiently and simultaneously. This results in increased performance and throughput for tasks involving large amounts of data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When negotiating a contract, Don asked for a company car instead of window office to be included because he is in need of the Possible answers: +car much more.; +office much more.;","completion":"When negotiating a contract, Don asked for a company car instead of a window office to be included because he is in need of the car much more. This decision was based on a few key factors that were carefully considered. Firstly, Don spends a considerable amount of time traveling to various client meetings and site visits. Having a company car would greatly reduce the expenses and inconveniences associated with using public transportation or his personal vehicle. By having a dedicated company car, Don would be able to stay better organized and be more efficient in terms of time management while moving between appointments. Secondly, as the company continues to grow and expand, the demands on employees like Don are increasing. By providing him with a company car, the organization facilitates seamless connectivity with clients, ensuring that Don is always able to meet their expectations and maintain the highest level of customer satisfaction. Moreover, Don's role within the company does not require him to be in the office for extended periods of time. Consequently, it is more beneficial for him to have access to a reliable mode of transportation rather than a window office. The frequency of his mobility means that the comfort and functionality of a company car are of significantly greater value to him than a window office. Lastly, providing a company car can have a positive impact on employee morale and reinforce the organization's commitment to supporting employees in their professional growth. By recognizing Don's unique needs and addressing them accordingly, the company demonstrates that they are invested in his success and enable him to maximize his potential without unnecessary hindrances. In conclusion, opting for a company car instead of a window office in the contract negotiations was a well-thought decision that ultimately better addresses Don's professional requirements. By prioritizing a reliable means of transportation, the company not only fosters increased efficiency and productivity, but also conveys support towards its employees."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Anka was born in Ottawa, Ontario, to Camelia (nee Tannis) and Andrew Emile \\"Andy\\" Anka Sr., who owned a restaurant called the Locanda. His parents were both Antiochian Orthodox Christians. Anka's father (Andy) was Syrian-American from 'Uyun al-Wadi, Syria from the Na'Nou' family and his mother (Camelia) was Canadian-Lebanese \\"from the town of Kfarmishki, Rashaya District, in Lebanon.\\" Anka sang with the St. Elias Antiochian Orthodox Church choir under the direction of Frederick Karam, with whom he studied music theory. Paul Anka recorded his first single, \\"I Confess\\", when he was 14. In 1957, with 100 given to him by his uncle, he went to New York City where he auditioned for Don Costa at ABC, singing what was widely believed to be a lovestruck verse he had written to a former babysitter. In an interview with NPR's Terry Gross in 2005, he stated that it was to a girl at his church whom he hardly knew. The song \\"Diana\\" brought Anka stardom as it rocketed to No. 1 on the Canadian and US music charts. \\"Diana\\" is one of the best selling singles ever by a Canadian recording artist. He followed up with four songs that made it into the Top 20 in 1958, including \\"It's Time to Cry\\", which hit No. 4 and \\"(All Of a Sudden) My Heart Sings\\", which reached No. 15, making him (at 17) one of the biggest teen idols of the time. He toured Britain, then Australia with Buddy Holly. Anka also wrote \\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\\" - a song written for Holly, which Holly recorded just before he died in 1959. Anka stated shortly afterward: \\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\\" has a tragic irony about it now, but at least it will help look after Buddy Holly's family. I'm giving my composer's royalty to his widow - it's the least I can do. Paul Anka's talent included the theme for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (reworked in 1962 from a song Anka wrote earlier called \\"Toot Sweet\\"; it had been rewritten with lyrics and recorded by Annette Funicello in 1959 as \\"It's Really Love\\"). Anka composed Tom Jones's biggest hit record, \\"She's a Lady\\", and wrote the English lyrics to \\"My Way\\", Frank Sinatra's signature song (originally the French song \\"Comme d'habitude\\"). In the 1960s, Anka began acting in motion pictures as well as writing songs for them, most notably the theme for the hit film The Longest Day (which also was the official march of the Canadian Airborne Regiment), in which he made a cameo appearance as a US Army Ranger. For his film work he wrote and recorded one of his greatest hits, \\"Lonely Boy\\". He also wrote and recorded \\"My Home Town\\", which was a No. 8 pop hit for him the same year. He then went on to become one of the first pop singers to perform at the Las Vegas casinos. In 1960, he appeared twice as himself in NBC's short-lived crime drama Dan Raven. In 1960, Anka signed with RCA Victor. He bought the rights and ownership of his ABC-Paramount catalog in 1963, but like most North American recording artists saw his career stalled by the British Invasion. By the late 1960s, his career focused on adult contemporary and big-band standards, played regularly in Las Vegas. In the early 1970s, he signed with Buddah Records, putting out two albums, a self-titled and Jubilation. The former, first released in 1971, bore the track \\"She's A Lady\\", a song he wrote that would become a signature hit for Welsh singer Tom Jones that same year.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering. Question: \\"What kept the U.S. government from being able to stop Bin Laden's flow of money?\\" Response: \\"Laundering\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

The main issues that kept the U.S. government from being able to stop Bin Laden's flow of money were the difficulty in distinguishing al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system and the unwillingness of the Treasury Department and CIA to commit resources to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Additionally, the FBI lacked a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising within the United States.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is an American retired professional basketball player and current president of basketball operations of the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played point guard for the Lakers for 13 seasons. After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers. He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. In 905 NBA games, Johnson tallied 17,707 points, 6,559 rebounds, and 10,141 assists, translating to career averages of 19.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 11.2 assists per game, the highest assists per game average in NBA history. Johnson shares the single-game playoff record for assists (24), holds the Finals record for assists in a game (21), and has the most playoff assists (2,346). He is the only player to average 12 assists in an NBA Finals series, achieving it six times. He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists (22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127). Johnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called \\"Showtime\\", described as a mix of \\"no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams.\\" Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, \\"There have been times when [Johnson] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody.\\" Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair. In the 1982 NBA Finals, he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era. Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous triple-double threats of all time; his 138 triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181. Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles in multiple series-clinching games. For his feats, Johnson was voted as one of the 50 Greatest Players of All Time by the NBA in 1996, and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002. ESPN's SportsCentury ranked Johnson #17 in their \\"50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century\\" In 2006, ESPN.com rated Johnson the greatest point guard of all time, stating, \\"It could be argued that he's the one player in NBA history who was better than Michael Jordan.\\" Several of his achievements in individual games have also been named among the top moments in the NBA. what was showtime about?","completion":"Showtime was a fast-paced style of basketball introduced by Magic Johnson.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who has thirty-seven individual panels attributed to him with confidence? is inside the article: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral...., can you guess it ?

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Force 10 from Navarone Movie plot: In 1943, after their successful mission on the Greek island of Navarone, Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant John Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill Nicolai. Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air. By the next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Where was the long sea voyage? , can you please find it? The film tells a fictionalized version of the Pilgrims' voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to North America aboard the Mayflower. During the long sea voyage, Capt. Christopher Jones falls in love with Dorothy Bradford, the wife of William Bradford. The love triangle is resolved in a tragic way at the film's conclusion. Ship's carpenter John Alden -- said to be the first person to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620—catches the eye of Priscilla Mullins, one of the young Pilgrims following William Bradford. Alden ultimately wins Priscilla in another, if subtler, triangle with Miles Standish. Lloyd Bridges provides comic relief as the first-mate Coppin, and child star Tommy Ivo gives a touching performance as young William Button, the only passenger to die on the actual voyage across the storm-swept Atlantic, who, according to this film, wanted to be the first to sight land and to become a king in the New World. \\"I'm going to be the first to see land.

Q:Question: \\"What growing-related practice isn't prominent?\\" Context: \\"Valencia enjoyed strong economic growth over the last decade, much of it spurred by tourism and the construction industry,[citation needed] with concurrent development and expansion of telecommunications and transport. The city's economy is service-oriented, as nearly 84% of the working population is employed in service sector occupations[citation needed]. However, the city still maintains an important industrial base, with 5.5% of the population employed in this sector. Agricultural activities are still carried on in the municipality, even though of relatively minor importance with only 1.9% of the working population and 3973 hectares planted mostly in orchards and citrus groves.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"From the context provided, the practice that isn't prominent in Valencia is agriculture. Specifically, the cultivation of crops and other farming-related activities. This conclusion is reached by examining the distribution of the working population in different sectors as mentioned in the context. Valencia's economy is predominantly service-oriented, with a vast majority, approximately 84%, of its working population employed in the service sector. This sector typically includes jobs in industries such as tourism, transportation, and telecommunications, all of which have seen significant growth and expansion in the past decade. The service industry's prominence indicates a shift in the city's economic focus towards more professionally oriented jobs and a move away from manual labor-based occupations, which was spurred by the rise in tourism and the construction industry. The industrial sector also holds a significant, but much lesser, portion with 5.5% of the city's working population. Industries may encompass fields such as manufacturing, engineering, and construction related employments. This presence indicates that while not the main economic driver, the industrial sector still plays a part in Valencia's economy. On the other hand, agricultural activities, such as farming and cultivation of crops, remain relatively less significant in Valencia. It is noted that only 1.9% of the working population is engaged in this sector, and a comparably small area (3973 hectares) is used for these activities, mostly for orchards and citrus groves. This small percentage clearly points to a less prominent role for agriculture in the city's overall economy. Therefore, in the context of economic sectors in Valencia, the practice of agriculture isn't prominent when compared to the more dominant sectors like service and industry. This may be due to a combination of factors such as urbanization, more lucrative opportunities in service and industrial sectors, and perhaps the geographical and climatic conditions, which may not be as conducive to extensive agricultural activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statements follow one of the following ten templates: 't1 occurs before t2, t1 doesn't occur before t2, t1 occurs after t2, t1 doesn't occur after t2, t1 occurs between t2 and t3, t1 doesn't occur between t2 and t3, t1 occured before t2 but after t3, t1 occured after t2 but before t3, t1 didn't occur before t2 but after t3, t1 didn't occur after t2 but before t3'. The output should be either 'True' or 'False'. Input: April 18, 2005 occured after Mar 22, 2010 but before Feb 22, 1972 Output:","completion":"To determine if the statement is true or false, first, we need to convert the dates provided into a comparable format (YYYY-MM-DD): - t1: April 18, 2005 → 2005-04-18 - t2: Mar 22, 2010 → 2010-03-22 - t3: Feb 22, 1972 → 1972-02-22 Now, we can analyze the statement: \\"t1 occured after t2 but before t3\\" This statement is saying that 2005-04-18 is after 2010-03-22 and before 1972-02-22. Comparing the dates, we have: - Is t1 after t2? (Is 2005-04-18 after 2010-03-22?) → False - Is t1 before t3? (Is 2005-04-18 before 1972-02-22?) → False Since both comparisons are false, the statement is False. Output: False"},{"prompt":"Given the question: Question: where are people likely to be joyous?

It searches for tiny particles which would improve scientists' understanding of dark matter. Dark matter is the invisible material thought to make up 95% of the universe. Dark matter has yet to be detected directly by scientists and has so far been observed only by its effects on gravity, which can be seen in the rotation of galaxies and the way light bends as it travels through space. The upgrade increases the chances of the detector identifying sub-atomic particles called Wimps - weakly interacting massive particles - which scientists believe are the main component of dark matter. A team of physicists, including scientists at Edinburgh University, have made Lux's ability to identify the lightest form of Wimps about 20 times more sensitive. This has allowed them to study data collected during Lux's initial run in 2013 which previously had to be ignored. Wimps are difficult to spot because they collide with normal matter only rarely, and their faint signals are drowned out by cosmic radiation from space. Professor Alex Murphy, of Edinburgh University's school of physics and astronomy, said: \\"Since Lux's first run, we have developed several new calibration techniques and methods of analysis. We are now able to look for tell-tale signs of Wimps in data we previously had to ignore, increasing our chances of detecting dark matter.\\" Lux is housed deep underground where few cosmic rays can penetrate, and consists of a tank of liquid xenon surrounded by sensitive light detectors. It is designed to spot collisions between Wimps and xenon atoms inside the detector. Following a collision, the xenon atom emits a tiny flash of light, which is spotted by Lux's light sensors. The upgrade was supported by the US Department for Energy and the National Science Foundation. The Lux scientific collaborative involves 19 institutions in Europe and the US.

Answer the following question: Information: - Finwë (Y.T. 1050Y.T. 1495; died aged c.4293), sometimes surnamed Noldóran, is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He was the first High King of the Elven Noldor to lead his people on the journey from Middle-earth to Valinor in the blessed realm of Aman. He was a great friend of Elu Thingol, the King of Doriath. The story of Finwë and Míriel, his first wife, has been described as an important element of Tolkien's mythology. \\"The Silmarillion\\", prepared by Christopher Tolkien from his father's unpublished writings, only briefly mentions the tale, although sources suggest that Tolkien had intended to incorporate a fuller version. - Fëanor is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium who plays an important part in \\"The Silmarillion\\". He was the eldest son of Finwë, the High King of the Noldor, and his first wife Míriel Serindë. Fëanor's mother, Míriel, died shortly after giving birth, having given all her strength and essence to him. - In J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium , Amrod ( IPA : ( amrod ) ) is a fictional character . He was the youngest son of Fëanor and the younger twin of Amras . From their mother Nerdanel they inherited red hair , instead of Fëanor 's black . Amrod 's father name in Quenya is Telufinwë , \`\` Last Finwë '' , for he was the last of Fëanor 's sons . His mother name was originally Ambarussa ( \`\` top - russet '' , referring to his hair ) , the same as his brother Amras , but Fëanor insisted that the twins ought to have different names and Nerdanel later called him Umbarto , \`\` the Fated '' . His father , disturbed by it , changed it to Ambarto . Nevertheless , both twins called each other Ambarussa . However \`\` Umbarto '' proved to be a prophetic name , for Amrod was accidentally killed in the swan ships of the Teleri , when his father ordered them to be burnt at Losgar . - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel \\"The Hobbit\\", but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold. - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled Ñoldor, meaning \\"those with knowledge\\" in Quenya) are High Elves of the Second Clan who migrated to Valinor and lived in Eldamar. The Noldor are called \\"Golodhrim\\" or \\"Gódhellim\\" in Sindarin, and \\"Goldui\\" by Teleri of Tol Eressëa. The singular form of the Quenya noun is \\"Noldo\\" and the adjective is \\"Noldorin\\". They were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri. Like the Teleri, they typically had grey eyes and dark hair (except for those who had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of Finarfin). - The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the \\"New York Herald Tribune\\" for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature. - The Silmarils (Quenya pl. Silmarilli, \\"radiance of pure light\\") are three fictional brilliant jewels composed of the unmarred light of the Two Trees in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The Silmarils were made out of the crystalline substance \\"silima\\" by Fëanor, a Noldorin Elf, in Valinor during the Years of the Trees. The Silmarils play a central role in Tolkien's book \\"The Silmarillion\\", which tells of the creation of Eä (the Universe) and the beginning of Elves, Men, and Dwarves. - In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, Amras is a fictional character, the twin brother of Amrod being the youngest sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel. Through their maternal grandfather Mahtan they inherited red hair (probably a dark red), instead of Fëanor's black. - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R.

This step is optional, but it can be helpful to ensure that your sundae has a good ice cream to sauce ratio. Often times, the bottom of layer is barren of any sauce and toppings. By putting sauce in the dish before you place any ice cream in it, you’ll ensure that your final bites of sundae have their fair share of sauce. Using your warm ice cream scoop, place two to three generous scoops of your favorite ice cream on the bottom of the dish. Plain vanilla ice cream is the classic ice cream to use for a sundae, but don’t feel limited. You can use chocolate, strawberry, cookies and cream, cookie dough, or any other flavor your heart desires. It won't take long – just warm them up for a few seconds. The sauces will be much easier to drizzle onto your ice cream once they are a little bit heated. This is especially useful if you want to top your sundae with something like peanut butter, which is obviously much thicker than normal sauce. Make sure to only microwave sauces that are in microwave-safe containers, or transfer the sauce to a small bowl or cup before heating. You can use the same sauce you coated the bottom of the dish with, or mix it up! Melted hot fudge is a classic ice cream sundae sauce, but there are a lot of other fun options in the grocery stores.

Question: Process: - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose burning less fossil fuels happens, how will it affect MORE bad effects of pollution. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Burning less fossil fuels will likely result in a decrease in overall air pollution, as the release of harmful gases like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and methane will be reduced. This can have a positive impact on curtailing the adverse effects of pollution. With the proposed perturbation, we can expect the following effects: 1. Reduced carbon dioxide emissions would lead to a decrease in the greenhouse effect, contributing to slower global warming rates. This will help to maintain a balance in the carbon cycle and reduce the overall negative impacts on the environment. 2. Decreased air pollution levels would also help in reducing the damage to the ozone layer caused by methane gas, CFCs, and other greenhouse gases. A healthier ozone layer will provide better protection from harmful ultraviolet rays. 3. Lowering the emissions of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants will result in a decrease in acid rain formation. This, in turn, can help protect forests and aquatic habitats from damage. 4. Additionally, indirect benefits could arise from reducing fossil fuel consumption. For example, renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro could become more prominent, leading to a cleaner, more sustainable energy system. In conclusion, the perturbation of burning less fossil fuels can have both direct and indirect benefits for reducing the harmful effects of pollution on the environment and ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Try to find a place that offers bowling lessons or has beginner bowling leagues. If you want to go bowling with friends, find a place that's rated for having a fun environment and maybe some food and snacks as well. Talk to the fellow bowlers and staff, and see if you can even join a game. Alternately, you can go to an alley with a group of friends. If you ask a crowd if you can join their game, make sure it isn't too competitive. You may even make new friends at the alley. If you're a beginner, you can just rent shoes at the alley. If you want to kick up your game, you can buy a pair of your own shoes. Street shoes won't work for bowling because they'll either make you stick to the floor instead of sliding naturally, or they'll make you slip too much and injure yourself. If you don't wear bowling shoes, you can also damage or leave scuff marks on the alley floor. Rent a pair of shoes unless you want to get in trouble before you even start bowling. Don't forget to wear socks or bring socks to the alley. Some alleys sell socks, but they will be expensive. Before you can begin to bowl, you need to find a ball that is the right weight for you and which is the right size for your fingers. The balls will be labeled based on their weight, so a ball with \\"8\\" written on it will weigh 8 pounds. Here's how to find a ball of the right size and weight: Weight. A 14-16 lb ball would work for most adults with bigger hands, and a 10-14 lb ball would work for most adults with smaller hands. Generally, it's better to have a ball that is a little heavier because it will help you gain momentum. A general rule is that a ball should weigh 10% as much as your body, so if you weigh 140 pounds, you should bowl with a 14 lb ball. Size of the thumb hole. Your thumb should fit snugly into the single thumb hole. You should be able to take it out of the hole without it snagging or getting stuck, but the hole shouldn't be so large that you have to squeeze your thumb in the hole to hang on. Size of the middle finger holes. Once you've inserted your thumb, you should lay your middle and ring finger across the other two holes. If the span is correct, your two fingers should easily and comfortably lay over the two holes so the middle joint lines up with the side of the hole closest to your thumb. Curl your two fingers into the holes to make sure they fit snugly in the hole like your thumb. Once you've signed up at the alley and put on your shoes, you will be directed to a bowling lane. If you get to choose your lane, pick a lane that is away from loud or noisy people. But it's your choice: you may be able to bowl better if you're surrounded by other bowlers.","completion":"The article is about finding a suitable local bowling alley, getting the right equipment like shoes and balls, and how to enjoy bowling with friends or join a beginner league."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - basement - antarctic - house - cellar - heat building The answer is \\"house\\" because A:","completion":"A furnace is an essential component in a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system that heats up and distributes warm air throughout a house. It works by generating heat through various means, such as burning fuel, using electricity, or absorbing heat from the environment, and then circulating this warmed air to maintain the desired indoor temperature. The primary reason why the answer is \\"house,\\" as opposed to the other options, is because a furnace is specifically designed and installed to provide heating solutions to residential buildings. Comparing the other options: 1. Basement: While it is true that furnaces are often installed in basements due to space and noise considerations, the actual purpose of a furnace is to heat the entire house, not just the basement. A basement is merely a location where the furnace is conveniently placed, allowing it to serve its function of heating the house more effectively. Therefore, \\"basement\\" is not the best answer, as it only refers to a location and not the primary function of a furnace. 2. Antarctic: The Antarctic is a geographical location and not an actual place where a furnace usually heats. While it is possible to find heating systems designed for extreme cold environments, such as those used in research stations in the Antarctic, a typical furnace serves residential buildings and not entire geographical regions. 3. Cellar: A cellar, similar to a basement, is a specific area within a house that can be used for storage or other purposes. Although a furnace may be placed in a cellar, the main goal of the furnace is to heat the whole house. Therefore, \\"cellar,\\" like basement, only indicates a possible location for the furnace's installation and not its actual purpose. 4. Heat Building: This term seems to be a combination of \\"heating\\" and \\"building.\\" Although furnaces do indeed heat residential buildings, the phrasing \\"heat building\\" is not a commonly used expression. Thus, it can be discarded as a suitable option. In summary, the answer to the question \\"Where does a furnace usually heat?\\" is \\"house\\" because a furnace serves as a heating solution primarily for residential buildings. While it may be placed in specific areas like basements or cellars, the ultimate function of a furnace is to provide warmth and comfort to the entire house."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This statement reflects strong dissatisfaction and disappointment on the part of the speaker towards the movie \\"Serving Sara.\\" The use of the concept of \\"hell\\" further accentuates the negative emotions attached to this experience. To break down the sentiment analysis: 1. Reference to \\"hell\\": Using the term \\"hell\\" to describe the situation indicates that the speaker feels extremely unhappy and agitated. Hell is typically associated with pain, torment, and displeasure, emphasizing the extent of the individual's dissatisfaction. 2. Checking the watch: The act of looking down at one's watch suggests that the speaker is not engaged or interested in the content they are watching. It is commonly understood that when someone checks the time during an activity, they may be eager for the event to end. In this case, the speaker is disappointed to find that they still have to endure half of the movie. 3. \\"Serving Sara\\": This movie title is specifically mentioned, showcasing that the negative emotions are directed towards this particular film and not movies in general. For the speaker, watching \\"Serving Sara\\" is an agonizing experience since they equate it with hell. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence can be perceived as highly negative and possibly exaggerated for the purpose of emphasizing the negative experience of watching \\"Serving Sara.\\" The speaker uses strong language and imagery to convey their dissatisfaction and lack of interest in the film, making it very clear how disappointing and unenjoyable the experience was for them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It shows how a powerful family with money and material goods has everything taken from them by the Workers ' Party of Korea . Kang 's family , while of Korean ethnicity , originally lived in Japan before emigrating to the DPRK at the behest of his communist grandmother . When Kang was nine years old , his grandfather was imprisoned for suspected activity against the State . As the policy at the time was to incarcerate the immediate family of political prisoners , Kang Chol - Hwan , his grandmother , father , uncle and younger sister Miho were all imprisoned at the Yodok concentration camp # 2915 . There they suffered and viewed many atrocities over a period of ten years including disease , starvation , torturous punishments and public execution . In the book , Kang states that , while in the camp , he met Pak Seung - zin , a member of the North Korean football squad in the 1966 FIFA World Cup . He says that Pak and other players had been imprisoned after returning from the tour . However , in the documentary film The Game of Their Lives , Pak and the other players were interviewed and denied there had been any retribution . Following his family 's release ( presumably upon the death of his grandfather , the original offender against the State ) , Kang worked in assigned occupations before becoming at risk of again being sent to a concentration camp . The end of the book details his subsequent escape to China and attempts to seek asylum before escaping to South Korea . The most recent publication , in 2005 , includes an account of his meeting former U.S. President George W. Bush .

Nu aşa arată o revoluţie energetică.- Translate to English","completion":"The sentence provided is in Romanian, and in English, it translates to, \\"This is not what an energy revolution looks like.\\" An energy revolution, in a general context, is referred to as a significant change in the way energy is produced, distributed, and consumed. This change could result from technological innovations, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer preferences. The phrase \\"This is not what an energy revolution looks like\\" appears to question the validity or effectiveness of a purported change in energy practice. To get a deeper understanding of its application, let's envision a few possible scenarios: 1. If it's applied in a critique of a new energy policy that heavily favours fossil fuel: The speaker may argue that an authentic energy revolution should pivot towards renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, or hydro, aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change. 2. If the statement is referred to the slow adoption rate of electric vehicles: The speaker could assert that a real energy revolution would involve faster adoption rates facilitated by supportive regulations, infrastructural changes, or public awareness campaigns highlighting the environmental benefits of electric vehicles. 3. In case it's used while discussing renewable energy technologies that remain largely undeveloped or underutilized: The speaker may imply that a true energy revolution would involve taking definitive actions to finance these technologies, develop them, and ensure they are utilized at scale. Evidently, for an energy revolution to be both valid and effective, it should bring about significant shift in energy production and consumption patterns, lean towards sustainability, and contribute to mitigating climate change effects. Changes that don't fit within these parameters may cause someone to say, \\"This is not what an energy revolution looks like.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: What exactly is a lie ?Is it anything we say which we know is untrue ?Or is it something more than that ?For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious attempt on the part of the liar to... Question: Which of the following is not mentioned in the passage as a sign of lying ?

He named the bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg. A. A. Milne later wrote a series of books featuring the fictional Winnie-the-Pooh. The series' illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, displayed in Assiniboine Park.The city has developed many distinct dishes and cooking styles, notably in the areas of confectionery and hot-smoked fish.

It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel.

It is a glimpse of the future of racing cars - where lasers are used instead of combustion engines, and the only cockpit displays are beamed onto the driver's helmet. Chevrolet says the Chaparral 2X Vision Gran Tursimo (VGT) concept was developed for the PlayStation 3 racing game, Gran Turismo 6 - but the firm has now built a real model of it, unveiled today at the LA Auto Show. It says the technology in the car could eventually make it onto roads. Scroll down for video. The game version of the car will be capable of a 240-mph top speed in the video game with 0-60 acceleration capability of 1.5 seconds.

The game version of the car will be capable of a 240-mph top speed in the video game with 0-60 acceleration capability of 1.5 seconds. 'This concept is an audacious and ambitious vision – and one that demonstrates to a new audience how Chevy's engineering and design teams challenge norms and explore the technologies of tomorrow,' said Clay Dean, executive director of advanced design. 'It also an ode to a unique partnership that pioneered ground-breaking technologies that are used today on the track and the street.' The Chevrolet Chaparral 2X VGThas a unique shape and an advanced, laser-based propulsion system. 'It was created in a no-rules atmosphere to challenge designers and test engineers to deliver the most exhilarating sensations. 'This is a fantasy car by design,' said Frank Saucedo, who oversaw the team that worked on the concept. 'Like the original Chaparral race cars decades ago, the Chaparral 2X VGT weaves advanced aerospace technologies into the design to help achieve its performance goals.' The Chaparral 2X VGT's concept propulsion system is inspired by technology derived from advanced work targeted at space travel and future aircraft design. It features a mid-mounted laser beamed-energy propulsion system, which pulses beams of light that focus in a shroud, creating shock waves that generate tremendous thrust in the lightweight race car.

The front of the Chevorlet Chaparral 2X Vision Gran Turismo concept car is shown during its world debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. With a 671-kW laser, powered by a pack of lithium-ion batteries, and an air-powered generator to provide 900 horsepower worth of thrust, the Chaparral 2X VGT will be capable of a 240-mph top speed in the video game with 0-60 acceleration capability of 1.5 seconds. The propulsion system's position in the composite chassis complements an unconventional yet highly active prone driver configuration – face down with the driver's arms and legs splayed toward the wheels. In fact, the race car's propulsion and suspension systems are built around the driver, enabling progressive strategies of active and driver-adjustable aerodynamics. 'Think of it as adapting a wing suit to a racing car, where the driver's movements control certain aspects of the aero package,' said Saucedo. 'In many ways, the Chaparral 2X VGT is like racing wing suit, with a protective fuselage for 'flying' very low to the ground.'

The propulsion system's position in the composite chassis complements an unconventional yet highly active prone driver configuration – face down with the driver's arms and legs splayed toward the wheels. The driver-enabled aerodynamics eliminate the need for large, conventional wings and other aero devices used to generate grip-enhancing downforce – an attribute that helps reduce the overall mass of the Chaparral 2X VGT's minimalist structure. Only essential elements are on board, with instrumentation, for example, projected on the driver's helmet visor. Additionally, lightweight chassis components reduce the sprung weight of the race car, enabling the car to provide tremendous cornering grip with a relatively small footprint.

'Chaparral's race cars and methods were seen as outlandish four decades ago, and with the innovative spirit still burning at Chevrolet, the Chaparral 2X Vision Gran Turismo concept might just be a harbinger of motorsports in the next four decades.' Other manufacturers have developed concept race cars for the Vision Gran Turismo project, but Chevrolet is one of the few to transfer it from the digital world to a physical concept vehicle.

The film--like the book--loses anchoring in some of the historical background, but it depicts a uniquely American dilemma set against the uniquely horrific American institution of human enslavement, and some of its tragic (and funny, and touching) consequences.

For many years it was recorded only by memory, and relayed only live, and in person. The blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War. Influenced by African roots, field hollers , ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar. He would sing a line, and the guitar would answer. From the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49, and the platform of the Clarksdale Railway Station, the blues headed north to Beale Street in Memphis. The blues have strongly influenced almost all popular music including jazz, country, and rock and roll and continue to help shape music worldwide. Bad luck and trouble are always present in the Blues. Relentless rhythms repeat the chants of sorrow, and the pity of a lost soul many times over. The blues form was first popularized about 1911-14 by the black composer W.C. Handy. However, the poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy's Memphis Blues(1912) and St.Louis Blues(1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early as 1913. During the twenties, the blues became a national craze. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, Crazy Blues in 1920. In the early 1960s, the urban bluesmen were \\"discovered\\" by young white American and European musicians. Many blues-based bands brought the blues to young white audiences. Since the sixties, rock has undergone several blues revivals. Some rock guitarists have used the blues as a foundation for offshoot styles. The latest generation of blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, gracing the blues tradition with their incredible technicality , have drawn a new generation listeners to the blues. Which of the following statements about the blues is NOTtrue? A) W. B) Lots of popular music is influenced by the blues. C) The blues of today have absorbed many elements of other music. D) Thanks to rock, the blues became the mainstream of music.

In the years since its release, singer Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy have occasionally been vocal about their dislike of this release, with Astbury calling it \\"sad\\" on their official website in 2006. Beggars Banquet had planned on using handmade drawings by Ian Astbury for the album's artwork, but when the drawings were lost, the record company subsequently replaced it with less than stellar car photos, and the band photo from The Cult's \\"Sonic Temple\\" record was used in the jacket sleeve, along with a short bio about the band, which guitarist Billy Duffy publicly expressed his disapproval about. Context_2 : Better Than the Rest is the third album (mini-album) of songs by George Thorogood and the Destroyers, recorded in 1974 and released in 1979.

Article: If you missed your chance earlier this year to rent that popular replica of van Gogh’s bedroom, you may now fight other art enthusiasts to win a much cooler opportunity: one night for two in Edward Hopper’s real, first bedroom. It will also be a unique experience to occur next spring, won through a public auction recently launched by The Edward Hopper House Art Center, the nonprofit that has cared for the artist’s old home since 1971. This is the first time the Edward Hopper House has allowed members of the public to live in the two-story building since its top floor was rented as an apartment in the ’70s. Built by the artist’s grandfather, the building now has a spot on the National Register of Historic Places. It’s also where Hopper’s creativity first flourished and where he produced many artworks until he turned 28 and moved to New York. His bedroom window offers views of the Hudson River, which inspired many of his early seascapes; the strong sunlight that greeted him in the morning also influenced how he rendered light in many of his artworks. For a forthcoming exhibition, Hopper’s room has also undergone a slight makeover from how it typically appears to visitors : interior designer Ernest de la Torre and architect Walter Cain have reimagined the space in period style, filling it with additional props after studying the painter’s early drawings and paintings of his bedroom. Before you get too excited about a quick getaway in the historic setting, though, take note: bids will likely reach staggering numbers particularly since the auction is raising funds to benefit arts education in local schools and student studio space at the House. The online event ends on the morning of October 15, with a live auction occurring in the afternoon. As of press time, only two parties have placed bids, with the leading figure standing at 650. But aside from purchasing the honor of sleeping in Hopper’s original bed (size: full), peeing in his former toilet, and strolling alone in his gardens, the winner will also enjoy a dinner at a restaurant and breakfast in the house. And for those with hygiene on their mind, don’t worry: the museum assures that Hopper’s bed will be fitted with a brand new mattress. ||||| Do you wish you could live the life of one of history’s greatest painters? Get out your brushes and your wallet: As Sarah Cascone reports for ArtNet News, fans of the American realist can bid on the chance to stay in a recreation of Edward Hopper’s bedroom in his Nyack, New York, house—a room the artist himself immortalized in some of his early paintings. Hopper was born in 1882 and he grew up in the Nyack house where he lived until 1910. His bedroom wasn’t just a place where the young artist snoozed. Rather, it influenced his work. The house and the bedroom overlook the Hudson River, which cast its light into his living space every day. The “Hudson River light” was known for its clarity and intensity, which attracted some of America’s greatest landscape painters to the area. Hopper went on to be influenced by the Hudson River School of painters, who flocked to places like Nyack to depict its fields and waters. Inspired by the boats and rocks he could see from his window and around his house, Hopper honed his artistic skills. The artist's house fell into disrepair after Hopper died in 1967, and it was slated for destruction until it was saved by fans. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and now is known as Edward Hopper House Art Center, a non-profit art center that preserves Hopper’s legacy, showcases his work and offers workshops and classes for art lovers. Interior designer Ernest de la Torre and architect Walter Cain used one of Hopper’s studies of his own bedroom around 1905 to recreate his room in period style. The second-story bedroom includes Hopper’s own bedframe, writes Cascone (don’t worry, the mattress is new) and a self-portrait of the young artist he painted in 1905-1906. So far, the auction, which will benefit local arts programs, has garnered 650 in bids. The winner can stay in the room with one other guest and includes dinner and a garden breakfast. Bidding will end on October 15 in a live event. Can’t afford to live like Hopper? The restaged room’s open for visitors, too, so take a peek next time you’re near NYC. The house has also made a walking tour of Nyack available as well, for those who want to go deeper into Hopper's life by exploring his boyhood haunts. ||||| Edward Hopper fans, get your bidding paddles ready. The Edward Hopper House Art Center is auctioning off the chance for two lucky art lovers to spend the night in the artist’s bedroom in Nyack, New York. The museum, where Hopper lived until he was 28, has recreated the historic bedroom in situ. Based on the artist’s early drawings and paintings of the room, interior designer Ernest de la Torre and architect Walter Cain have done their best to return the space to its former appearance with period-appropriate furniture and decor.

The residence, on the National Register of Historic Places, is now a museum and arts center, and has not had overnight visitors since the 1970s, when the top floor was rented out to tenants. The overnight stay will be the highlight of the current exhibition, “Edward Hopper’s Bedroom Reimagined,” on view through the end of May.

Question: This article: Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death.

Ginger's transformation into a male was an unexpected development that Clive and Elsa failed to notice because they were focused on their secret project - a viable prepubescent female creature named Dren, who they created by disobeying the orders of their superiors, Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow, who had instructed them to investigate and extract proteins for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. The discovery of Ginger's sex change occurred during a highly publicized presentation of their work when Fred and Ginger engaged in a savage fight to the death. The unfortunate incident highlighted the dangers of creating hybrid creatures and the potential consequences of scientists pursuing their own agendas without proper oversight and ethical considerations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The plant is located at Barabkunda in Chittagong under independent power producers (IPP) arrangement of the government. Regent Power is operating on natural gas with the capacity to produce 22 MW per day. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Regent Power consistently produces 22 MW or electricity each day.","completion":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that Regent Power has the capacity to produce 22 MW of electricity per day. However, it is important to note a few distinctions between capacity and actual production before confirming the statement to be true or false. First, having the capacity to generate 22 MW per day indicates that under ideal conditions, the power plant can produce this amount of electricity within a 24-hour timeframe. This, however, does not guarantee that the plant consistently operates at its maximum capacity to produce 22 MW of electricity daily. Second, the plant's actual output may be influenced by multiple factors that can either increase or decrease its generation activities. These factors could include fluctuations in natural gas supplies, maintenance activities, demand variations, or other unforeseen events disrupting optimal operations, which ultimately affects the actual electricity production. Lastly, the Independent Power Producers (IPP) arrangement is an important aspect to consider. IPPs are typically bound by specific performance and contractual agreements with governments or utilities. These agreements may regulate the amount of electricity generated by the plant, which could end up impacting its daily production, either by having to adhere to predetermined levels or responding to fluctuations in demand. In conclusion, based on the provided paragraph, we cannot definitively determine whether Regent Power consistently produces 22 MW of electricity each day, as it only informs us of the capacity and not empirical production records. Additional information on actual production statistics and factors affecting the plant's operations would be needed to confirm the company's daily electricity output with reasonable certainty."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cincinnati would get off to a fast start in the first quarter as quarterback Carson Palmer hooked up with wide receiver Andre Caldwell on a 6-yard touchdown pass, while running back Cedric Benson got a 1-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, the Bengals would add onto their lead as kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 23-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, the Ravens tried to strike back in the fourth quarter with running back Ray Rice getting a 2-yard touchdown run, yet Cincinnati's defense held on for the victory. Chad Ochocinco jokingly flashed a 1 bill at a referee during the third quarter, and was subsequently fined 20,000 by the NFL.

A 95-year-old man has died weeks after his 96-year-old wife was taken from him by family members embroiled in an inheritance row. Eddie Harrison passed away on Tuesday at a hospital in Virginia following a bout of influenza. He apparently became distressed when one of his daughter-in-laws left home with his spouse, Edith Hill, in a bid to protect her share of assets. Scroll down for video. Longtime loves: Eddie Harrison passed away on Tuesday at a hospital in Virginia weeks after his 96-year-old wife, Edith Hill, was taken from him by family members embroiled in an inheritance row. The two had been friends for years before they married earlier this year. The couple married in Alexandria earlier this year after being friends for more than a decade and that's where the trouble started. Their union was investigated because Hill had been declared legally incapacitated for several years and some family members were worried about their inheritance. The senior's estate included property on the edge of Old Town Alexandria, worth about 475,000, according to real estate assessments. There was also concern about who would care for Hill and where she would live. During the investigation Hill and Harrison said they wanted to stay together. 'I guess I wanted company,' Hill said in an interview, explaining why she married. 'I wanted somebody I could help, and they could help me. We were both single. My husband was gone. His wife was gone. We became the best of friends.' Hill met Harrison after striking up conversation in a queue for lottery tickets, with one of the tickets turning into a 2,500 winner. After years of friendship the duo decided to tie the knot. Along with their age, the interracial aspect of the marriage was also unique, with Hill being black and Harrison being white. In fact, the longtime Virginians would not have been allowed to marry if they had met in their 20s or 30s or 40s, given state's law banning interracial marriages at the time. One of Hill's daughters, Rebecca Wright, supported the marriage while her other daughter, Patricia Barber, contested the arrangement. A judge appointed a new guardian for Hill to protect her interests, removing Barber and Wright as guardians, but decided to leave the marriage intact. On December 6, Hill's guardian arrived to take Hill away to Barber's home in Florida for what was supposed to be a two-week vacation. Police were called to the home during a traumatic 40-minute negotiation to convince Hill to leave, Wright said. When Hill did not return home as planned after two weeks, Harrison reportedly began to realize she was not coming back. Daisy Birch, a family friend, said Harrison was heartbroken. He also became ill with the flu and checked himself into a hospital. A dispute continues between the two sisters, Barber and Wright, over Hill's affairs and place of residence.

The works of the major Hellenistic historians Hieronymus of Cardia (who worked under Alexander, Antigonus I and other successors), Duris of Samos and Phylarchus which were used by surviving sources are all lost. The earliest and most credible surviving source for the Hellenistic period is Polybius of Megalopolis (c. 200-118), a statesman of the Achaean League until 168 BCE when he was forced to go to Rome as a hostage. His Histories eventually grew to a length of forty books, covering the years 220 to 167 BCE.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Perk yourself up by listening to music. Music triggers emotional responses in humans, helping us engage many parts of the brain. Listen to music that's energizing to you. If possible, dance or sing along, even if you just bob your head or hum. Music that's irritating or jarring may keep you awake better than music that's familiar. Just do your co-workers a favor and remember to use headphones! Listen quietly instead of loudly. It's a common misconception that blasting music loud will help keep you awake. Actually, turning the music down to a very low level is more effective. It forces you to try to listen closely in order to hear the instruments, lyrics, and percussion. If you're having difficulty discerning the lyrics, then the volume is just right, because this means your mind's working. Getting interested can work as a distraction. If you are interested in something, your brain is focusing.You can get interested in your work or something that is happening in your surroundings. Preferably, natural daylight. Your body's internal clock (its circadian rhythms) are regulated by your exposure to sunlight. This means you can trick your body into believing it should be awake even when it feels tired. Step outside, even just for a bit. If you can step outside (even on a cloudy day) or look out the window for a full minute, you'll be more alert. Work the artificial lights. Even if you're in an environment where there's artificial light, brighter is better. Wherever you work, see if you can replace the light fixture or add a lamp that will brighten your workspace. If you chew ice, it's almost impossible to fall asleep. The chilling temperature keeps the brain on its toes, even while you are driving late at night, exhausted, and what you really want to do is fall asleep. Chewing anything, even if it's just your pen or pencil, causes your body to think you are about to eat. Your body will prepare for food intake by releasing insulin, which will make you more alert. If it's a little cold, take off your sweater or jacket so you stay on the chilly side. Open a window or put on a small fan, pointed at your face. The reason your body responds the way it does to cold is that it's prepping itself to work to keep you warm. Your body needs to regulate your internal temperature to keep all of its organs functioning. So if it detects ice or extreme cold, it will work to keep itself awake longer. A pungent scent — good or bad — can make you more alert very quickly. Aromatherapists often recommend essential oils of the following plants to stimulate the nervous system and reduce fatigue. Open the bottle and take a big whiff of the following when you're feeling drowsy: Eucalyptus blue gum Peppermint Coffee; beans or brewed, both work: a study has shown that simply smelling coffee can awaken a person. Of course, not all of us have essential oils stored in our file cabinets. Using hand lotions or burning candles with these same scents could help. Herbs like rosemary and peppermint can often be found fresh or dried at a grocery store; for a little pick-me-up, take a pinch and roll it between your fingertips and smell it. Eating can help you stay awake, as long as you avoid a full stomach. As most of us know, eating to excess often makes us sleepy, so don't eat a full pizza or that 12 oz. steak during lunch. Munch on snacks all day rather than having a big meal. The key is to not get a spike of sugar intake (followed by the inevitable crash). Predictably, the same goes for caffeine: break your coffee, soda, or energy drink consumption down into small doses. Avoid breakfast that are high in carbs (muffins, toast, pastries, bagels, etc.). You're giving your body a reason to crash at about 11 AM because it gets a sugar spike early on. Put a small handful of sunflower seeds in your cheek and crack them open one at a time, using only your teeth and tongue; this will require just enough active thought and tongue movement to prevent you from dozing off, and the salt of the sunflower seeds is invigorating and stimulating; spit out the sunflower husks into a paper cup as you go, as quietly as possible so as to not disturb others around you. The internet is full of interesting websites where you can choose from a variety of games to play online. Pick a word game, or a puzzle, a car racing game or anything that suits your liking. Spending just about 15-20 minutes playing a game will awaken your mind because it is not taxing or boring in any way. It's more fun if you pick a game you're good at.

A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Options: A a smaller orange circle appears bigger on a white background B an orange circle appears bigger than a gray one of the same size C a circle surrounded by other circles looks bigger than its real size D a circle surrounded by bigger ones looks smaller than its real size Answer: D a circle surrounded by bigger ones looks smaller than its real size Question: Answer:","completion":"Question: According to the article, what is the visual illusion that affects older children and adults in identifying the sizes of circles?

Context: U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why was RealClearPolitics involved?

Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation. On the other hand, the output force is greater than the input force because it is applied over a shorter distance. Like other simple machines, the ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is given by I am facing a new situation today: Adams needs to roll a piano into his new house. The piano is very heavy and unfortunately he isn't strong enough to lift it up his front steps. A friend of his suggests he get a ramp since it will support part of the weight allowing him to push it into his house much easier. Adam gets the ramp and successfully pushes the piano in to his new house. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which would be easier, pick up a large object and carrying it or pushing it on a ramp?. Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article and the concept of inclined planes as simple machines, it would be easier to push a large and heavy object, such as the piano, up a ramp rather than attempting to lift and carry it. The inclined plane, or ramp, makes it possible to exert less force to move the object uphill, by supporting part of its weight as it moves along the slope. The explanation behind this concept lies in the trade-off between force and distance, which is a fundamental principle of simple machines. When an object such as a heavy piano is moved up an incline, the input force required is less due to the division of the object's weight between the vertical and horizontal components. However, this reduction in force required comes at the cost of having to cover a greater distance as the object is moved along the ramp. In essence, the work done remains the same, but the task of moving the object becomes more manageable by distributing the required force over a longer distance. In contrast, attempting to pick up a large, heavy object and carrying it directly requires a much greater input force because the full weight of the object needs to be supported while it is lifted. This method is not only more physically demanding but also poses a higher risk of injury, especially for tasks involving a considerable weight like moving a piano. Therefore, the proper answer to the question of which would be easier - picking up a large object and carrying it or pushing it up a ramp - is unquestionably pushing it up a ramp. Utilizing the inclined plane as a simple machine in Adams' situation not only allowed him to move the piano into his house with less force but also made the task more manageable and safer overall. By reducing the physical effort required, the ramp provided an efficient solution for moving a heavy object like the piano, without compromising the overall work done in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What type of situation is taking place at the grocery store? Title: Cobra Movie plot: An armed gunman causes a hostage situation at a Los Angeles grocery store. When negotiations between him and the law fail, Marion Cobretti (codenamed \\"Cobra\\") (Sylvester Stallone), a member of an elite division of the Los Angeles Police Department known as the \\"Zombie Squad\\", is summoned to the scene. Cobretti infiltrates the store, locates, and negotiates with him. During the negotiation, the criminal speaks of the unknown \\"New Order\\", a group of social darwinist radicals that despise modern society and believe in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule the world. Cobretti then kills the gunman by throwing a knife at his abdomen and firing shots at him. As the bodies are removed from the supermarket, Cobretti is admonished by Detective Monte (Andrew Robinson) for his seeming disregard for police procedures and protocols. Harassed by reporters, Cobretti admonishes them for failing to put the safety of potential victims first. Little does everyone realize at the time is that the supermarket hostage crisis is only one of a string of recent and seemingly unconnected acts of violence and murder that have broken loose in Los Angeles, perpetrated by the same supremacist group the supermarket gunman mentioned. After witnessing several individuals going on a spree killing, including the New Order leader, only identified as 'The Night Slasher' (Brian Thompson), model and businesswoman Ingrid Knudsen (Brigitte Nielsen) becomes the group's main target due to her being the only living witness to their crimes. After a failed attempt on her by the group, she is placed under the protective custody of Cobretti and his partner, Sergeant Tony Gonzales (Reni Santoni). Several more attempts are made on their lives by various people connected to the Order. Cobretti theorizes that there is an entire army of killers operating with the same modus operandi rather than a lone serial killer with some associates, but his suggestion is rebuffed by his superiors. However, the LAPD agrees with Cobretti that it...

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognized as a landmark in the devlopment of symphonic form? Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

Question: Who plays Eddie Sanger in the movie? Title: Suspect Movie plot: Set in Washington DC, Suspect centers on three disparate characters. Carl Wayne Anderson is a homeless, deaf-mute Vietnam veteran accused of murdering Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department. Kathleen Riley is the beleaguered Federal Public Defender assigned to represent Anderson. An agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger, is made a member of the jury and begins investigating the details of the murder himself, eventually teaming up with Riley to solve the case. We see some early scenes of Sanger's work as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, including his efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman. While not relevant to the movie's plot, these scenes are establishing shots giving us a sense for Sanger as a charming, though somewhat ruthless, person.The movie begins around Christmas with the suicide of a United States Supreme Court Justice, for which no explanation or context is given. We only see the Justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly after the Justice's suicide, Elizabeth Quinn's body is found floating in the Potomac river, and Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was found sleeping in Quinn's car, which was abandoned in the parking lot where she worked (and was mostly deserted at night). Anderson explains that he found it unlocked and was just looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was found in Quinn's car, he was arrested for her murder. The establishing scenes show Riley trying to communicate with Anderson and realizing that he is a deaf-mute. Over time, she begins to penetrate his hard exterior and he tries to cooperate with her efforts to mount a defense for him.In the District of Columbia, all crimes are tried in the federal courts, so a murder trial that would normally be in state court was in federal court instead.

In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Different than the first, but good Product review: A lot of readers seem to be upset because Lyra takes the backseat in this novel to Will, a new character from a world like our own. While I did find some of Lyra's actions to be atypical of the feisty, brave girl that we met in The Golden Compass, I understand that Pullman had to introduce the character of Will to continue to flesh out the Paradise Lost parallels, and to give Lyra someone to journey with. There is a lot of death in this and the third book, and a lot of religious themes that some might find offensive or confusing (though one must remember that this is a novel, not an editorial or non-fiction piece; it is fake). I like Will and still love Lyra. I found this to be the weakest of the trilogy, but a must read to fully appreciate the series. Answer:","completion":"The given review would likely increase the chances of me buying the product, although with a few reservations. The reviewer starts by addressing a common concern among readers about the addition of a new character, Will, which results in Lyra not being as central to the story as she was in The Golden Compass. However, they provide a sensible explanation for this change by mentioning the author's intention to parallel the story with Paradise Lost and the need for Lyra to have a companion on her journey. Additionally, the reviewer points out the presence of death and religious themes, which they acknowledge might not be to everyone's taste but reminds us that it's a fictional narrative. This can be seen as both a warning and an encouragement for potential readers, depending on their preferences for literary themes. Though the reviewer finds this book to be the weakest of the trilogy, they still consider it a must-read to fully appreciate the series. This honest appraisal indicates that the book does have value and contributes to the overall series, which may persuade me to buy the product. In summary, the review increases the likelihood of purchasing the product due to the reasonable explanations provided for character changes, a clear reminder of the book's fictional nature, and the reinforcement of the book's importance within the trilogy. However, it's essential to consider personal preferences regarding themes and story development before making the final decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the character whose handkerchief is found under the body of a murdered child? Just-married taxi driver Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning is led to an abandoned bomb-site by an eight-year-old girl who says that she has lost her dog. The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case. She later wins the sympathy of the junior counsel Peter Tanner, who visits Manning in prison, believes in his protestation of innocence and makes the case his own. The trial begins at London's Old Bailey, where Tanner is opposed by his father, prosecuting counsel Geoffrey Tanner. The trial is presided over by Justice Harrington, whose wife is in the hospital undergoing a serious operation. It soon becomes evident that things are going badly for Manning. Jurors are seen expressing their belief in Manning's guilt even before the trial was over. Irene's mother gave hearsay evidence that Manning had given the victim sweets, breaking down in tears and accusing Manning of murder. Following the testimony of prosecution-witness Horace Clifford, all of the evidence seems to point to Manning's guilt.

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected, and is appalled that, given the circumstances of the Cold War, if she stays with him, she will likely never see her home or family again. Armstrong visits a contact, a \\"farmer\\" (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment, in order to learn how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. Armstrong has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as Ï. However, he was followed to the farm by his official guard, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer.

James Bond and the Queen Parachute Into the Olympics [VIDEO] “Good evening, Mr. Bond,” Her Majesty said to one of the UK’s most iconic characters (played by actor Daniel Craig), before being escorted out of Buckingham Palace. The queen and 007 — or, rather, actors portraying them — then parachuted into London’s opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics. In case the IOC removes this video from YouTube, you can watch an official, but abridged version of it here. Jones, whose social media success we profiled in May, is the standard bearer for Olympians on Twitter. She's honest, hilarious, tweets often, and is a world class hurdler for the United States. A member of the American men's basketball team, Love is one of the NBA's cleverest players on Twitter. He should be an entertaining follow in London. Bolt will be one of the Olympics' biggest stars. The Jamaican sprinter recently told us about his interest in tech and social media. He shares photos often on Twitter. Mata helped Spain to the Euro 2012 title earlier this summer and will look to follow that up with an Olympic championship in August. He tweets in English and Spanish. The Danish tennis star is engaging on Twitter, frequently posting her training and status updates. Even better, she dates pro golfer Rory Mcilroy — both are terrific follows when the other is competing. The top women's basketball player in the world suits up for the United States. Parker is active, humorous and down-to-earth on social media. The American swimmer told us in May that he uses social media to boost his visibility and marketing potential. His lighthearted tweets and frequent interactions with fans on Twitter helped him pick up sponsors like BMW and Got Chocolate Milk. A wrestler for the United States, Burroughs' frequent updates, enthusiasm and humor have helped him rack up more than 20,000 followers. His handle, @alliseeisgold, is pretty cool too. Meichtry swims for Switzerland and is betrothed to American swimmer Jessica Hardy. He's enthusiastic about sharing the Olympic experience with followers. The American middle-distance runner spoke to us in June. He is super active on Twitter and is an outspoken advocate for Olympians' rights to market themselves, despite IOC restrictions. Perhaps the 2012 Olympics' biggest celebrity, James won his first NBA title with the Miami Heat in June and will look to follow up in London with his second gold medal. He took time off Twitter during the NBA Playoffs, but will likely be much more active during the summer games. The soccer prodigy tweets mostly in Portuguese, but should be a fun follow as he tries to lead Brazil to its first Olympic title. An American swimmer, Coughlin is super friendly, funny and accessible on Twitter. In May, it was reported that Adlington would forsake Twitter in London because of cruel social media trolls.

A star diver for Australia, Mitcham is one of the games' few high profile openly gay competitors. The United States women's soccer team's erstwhile goalkeeper is a great follow for soccer fans and non-fans alike. Ginobili tweets largely in Spanish, but the basketball star is still worth your attention. You'll love his sheer joy representing Argentina and respect his obvious pride for his country. And really, that's what the Olympics are all about. The American swimmer and rising marketing juggernaut is generous about interacting with followers and providing a glimpse inside the life of a London superstar. Powell is one of a handful of incredible Jamaican sprinters. He frequently posts slice-of-life photos and — as evidenced by the screenshot at left — is religious about replying to fans and well wishers. Still just a teen, the British diver is already a celebrity in the UK. He's smart about using social media to his advantage. Nicknamed \\"Blade Runner,\\" the South African runner has prosthetic lower legs. He will become the first double-amputee to ever compete in the Olympics (he'll also participate in the Paralympics).

The Serbian tennis powerhouse is favored to win in London. He's more active on Twitter than some of the sport's other stars. Sullivan is an Australian sprint swimmer.

Alabama chief justice tells probate judges not to issue gay marriage licenses Feb. 8, 2015: Shanté Wolfe, left and Tori Sisson, right, sit near the Montgomery County Courthouse Sunday in Montgomery, Ala. Wolfe and Sisson camped out all night on Sunday to be the first couple to marry in Montgomery on Monday morning. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) MONTGOMERY, Ala. – Alabama appeared set within hours to become the 37th state where gays can legally wed, prompting one couple to pitch a tent outside a courthouse even as the state's chief justice made an 11th hour bid to keep the weddings on hold Monday. Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore sent a letter Sunday evening to probate judges ordering them to refuse to issue same-sex marriage licenses when the courts opened Monday morning. Moore wrote that the judges weren't bound by a federal judge's ruling Jan. 23 that the marriage ban was unconstitutional. \\"Effective immediately, no probate judge of the state of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent with (the Alabama Constitution),\\" Moore wrote. Susan Watson, executive director The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, called the move by the conservative chief justice \\"grandstanding\\" and predicted licenses would be issued shortly. \\"We will see marriage equality in Alabama tomorrow. I don't think the probate judges in Alabama are going to defy a federal court judge's order,\\" Watson said late Sunday. U.S. District Judge Callie Granade had ruled that the state marriage ban was unconstitutional and -- in a later clarifying order -- said that probate judges have a legal duty under the U.S. Constitution to issue the licenses. The developments unfolded as at least one couple showed up early at the county courthouse in one major city, Montgomery, and more were expected at courthouses around the state in coming hours. Tori Sisson and Shante Wolf pitched a blue and white tent outside the Montgomery County Courthouse and hugged as they waited in hopes of being the first couple to get a marriage license in Alabama. \\"It's about time,\\" Wolfe, 21, said of gay marriage being allowed in the Deep South state. The chief justice, Moore, has been one of the state's most outspoken critics of gay marriage. He called homosexuality an \\"evil\\" in a 2002 custody ruling and urged judges to reject issuing such licenses in recent days. A few probate judges have said they would refuse to issue the licenses until they received greater clarity from the courts. Moore, as head of the court system, upped the ante Sunday night by sending the directive, although, it was unclear what enforcement provision he has. Moore's letter to the probate judges said Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley can take action against elected officials who fail to follow the law. Jennifer Ardis, a spokeswoman for Bentley, said she did not know about Moore's letter and did not have an immediate comment Sunday evening. Couples plan to seek marriage licenses across the state with marriage equality groups providing ministers and judges to perform ceremonies in Huntsville and Birmingham. Attorney General Luther Strange has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to put aside Granade's order since justices are expected to issue a ruling later this year on whether gay couples have a right to marry nationwide. The high court had not ruled on the state's request within hours of the opening of courthouses Monday. The ACLU has established a hotline for couples to report if they are refused a license. Watson said the ACLU will be at courthouses across the state, not just to be prepared for problems, but to hand out balloons and gifts to joyful couples. \\"I think it will really pretty simple. Hopefully we will be able to hand out a lot of wedding favors,\\" Watson said. More than 100 people attended a \\"Sanctity of Marriage\\" rally at the Alabama Capitol on Saturday.

We have this equation to solve for \\"v\\": -14535*v = -16193*v + 187354 What we want to do is find out what number \\"v\\" is. So let's start by getting all the \\"v\\" terms on one side of the equation and all the number terms on the other side. To do this, we'll start by adding 16193*v to both sides. When we do that, we'll be left with: -14535*v + 16193*v = 187354 Now, let's add -14535*v and 16193*v together: 16193*v - 14535*v = 1658*v So now, our equation looks like this: 1658*v = 187354 To find out what \\"v\\" is, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by 1658: v = 187354 / 1658 When we do the division: v = 113 So, the answer to our math problem is: v = 113.

Launched in December, the satellite has now taken up its observing station some 1.5 million km from Earth. Engineers are currently commissioning Gaia's two telescopes and its three instruments, getting them ready to begin mapping the precise positions and motions of one-thousand-million stars. As part of that process, an image has been produced of a small star cluster. This grouping is sited in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a companion galaxy to our own Milky Way, some 160,000 light-years in the distance. If the picture just released by the European Space Agency looks somewhat underwhelming, that is not really surprising - taking pretty vistas of the sky is not what this mission is about. Rather, Gaia's job when operational will be to track and characterise points of light moving across its big camera detector - be those stars, asteroids, comets or the flashes generated by exploding objects such as supernovae - to work out how far away they are and how they are moving in relation to everything else. Prof Gerry Gilmore, the UK Gaia principal investigator from Cambridge University, told BBC News: \\"This image tells us that they've turned on the electronics, that they've turned on the computer, and that they've turned on Gaia's incredible British-built camera - and it's all working. Gaia - The discovery machine \\"Gaia was not designed to take Hubble-like pictures; this is not its operating mode at all. What it will eventually do is draw little boxes around each of the stars you see in this picture and send just that information to the ground.\\" The satellite has been given an initial mission duration of five years to make its 3D map of the sky. By repeatedly viewing its targets, it should get to know the brightest stars' coordinates down to an error of just seven micro-arcseconds - an angle equivalent to a euro coin on the Moon being observed from Earth. One of the benefits of such study will be to refine the distance \\"ladder\\" used to measure scale in the Universe. This ladder describes a number of techniques that lean on each other in a stepwise fashion to calculate the separation between Earth and some of the most far flung objects in the cosmos. To the bottom of this ladder is the trigonometric parallax technique that Gaia will employ to measure distances. Traditionally, this has only worked with stars inside the Milky Way. But Gaia's advanced optics will for the first time extend parallax to stars in the LMC. In the past, the cloud's position has been determined only indirectly by studying the next rung up - the characteristic pulsations of particular stars known as Cepheids. Having some parallax measurements in the LMC instead will allow astronomers to better calibrate the ladder and its various techniques, such as Cepheid pulsations. And that should mean researchers having more confidence in the figures calculated for even greater distances. Prof Gilmore said: \\"Currently, we have precision distances - i.e. to 1% accuracy - to only one Cepheid star, which is Polaris (the North Star). So the whole distance scale to the Magellanic clouds depends on very shaky foundations. Gaia will be the 'sanity check' on the distance ladder where all of our different methods overlap. \\"But Gaia will do even more because until now the accuracy to which we could work meant that we had to assume the Large Magellanic Cloud was a single point at one distance. We've had to average out properties. With Gaia, we will resolve out the LMC in three dimensions and that will tell us far more about its structure, and that will really open it up to proper scientific study.\\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Launched in December, the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite is now in its observing station 1.5 million km from Earth.

It says Ukraine is undermining the non-political nature of the contest. The union, which produces Eurovision, said it had offered two possible solutions to Channel One. The proposals were for Ms Samoilova to perform via satellite from Russia or for another contestant to be allowed to travel to Ukraine to take her place.

They downloaded police and social security files from the computers. Prosecutors said it was the \\"largest hacking case to date\\". Soon after the sentence was announced, lawyers representing Mr Warg said they would launch an appeal. Warg's accomplice was given a six-month jail sentence but walked free from the court, having served 17 months in pre-trial detention. The initial hack attack took place in February 2012 and gave the pair access to the sensitive information, including social security numbers and police records, for about six months. Defence lawyers said that, although the hack attacks were carried out using a computer owned by Warg, he was not the person that used it to steal the files. Instead, they said, an unnamed hacker took over this machine and used it to carry out the attacks. Warg has declined to name this other hacker. After considering evidence, the judge and jury in the case said it was \\"unlikely\\" that other people were responsible. The court's decision is the third to go against Warg in the last five years. He was deported from Cambodia in September 2013 to Sweden where he served a jail term for copyright theft because of his involvement with the Pirate Bay file-sharing site. In a separate trial in 2013, Warg was sentenced to two years in a Swedish jail for hacking into a bank's computers. This sentence was reduced to one year on appeal. In that trial, Warg and accomplice were found guilty of breaking into the computer systems of computer services firm Logica, which was doing work for Sweden's tax office and a bank. On that occasion his accomplice was put on probation. In late November 2013 he was deported to Denmark to face charges in the CSC hacking cases. Summary:","completion":"A man named Mr. Warg and an unidentified co-defendant were found guilty by a Danish court for hacking into computers owned by CSC, a tech services giant. Prosecutors labeled this as the \\"largest hacking case to date.\\" The pair were convicted for downloading sensitive information such as social security numbers and police records from CSC's computers over a span of about six months, beginning in February 2012. Warg's lawyers disputed the charges, claiming that while the hack indeed originated from a computer owned by Warg, he was not personally responsible for the theft. They argued a yet-unidentified third party had seized control of the machine to enact the cyber-attacks. However, both the jury and judge declared this alternative theory improbable. After the verdict announcement, Warg's lawyers reported their plans to appeal. His accomplice was sentenced to six months in jail but was allowed to leave the court as they had already served 17 months in pre-trial detention. This is the third verdict against Warg in the past five years. Previously, in September 2013, Warg was extradited from Cambodia to Sweden to serve a jail term for copyright theft due to his connection to the Pirate Bay file-sharing site.

In 2010 18 NMEs (New Molecular Entities) were approved and three biologics by the FDA, or 21 in total, which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008. On the other hand, there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006. Since 2001, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year. This approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (new chemical entity, or NCE), has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD(not including marketing expenses). Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades. How many drugs were approved in 2007?","completion":"In 2007, there were 18 drugs approved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The bulk of the cases have thus far been reported in Illinois and Iowa. Health officials have also reported cases in Wisconsin, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota. The halt on salad sales has been implemented in those states, as well as at stores in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, North Dakota, Montana, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Missouri. Cyclospora infection can effectively be treated with antibiotics.","completion":"Title: McDonald’s Removes Salads from Thousands of Locations after Multistate Cyclospora Outbreak Introduction: A non-fatal, but unpleasant infection called cyclospora has lately been making headlines as it has affected at least dozens of people across multiple states. This parasitic illness has been traced back to McDonald’s salads, prompting the fast-food giant to temporarily remove salads from its menu in approximately 3,000 locations. Outbreak Details: According to USA Today, McDonald's customers in six states—Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota—fell ill due to cyclospora, a parasite that can cause uncomfortable symptoms such as watery diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea, and fatigue. Of the affected individuals, most of the cases have been reported in Illinois and Iowa. In response to this outbreak, McDonald’s decided to halt salad sales in the aforementioned states and several others, including Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, North Dakota, Montana, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Missouri. The company is currently seeking an alternate supplier for its salad mixes to ensure customer safety. Official Statements: In a statement released by McDonald’s, the company emphasized its commitment to maintaining the highest standards of food safety and quality control. It reassured the public that it is closely monitoring the situation and actively cooperating with state and federal public health authorities in their ongoing investigations. Cyclospora and Treatment: Cyclospora is a parasite that causes cyclosporiasis, the infection responsible for the recent outbreak. While it’s not life-threatening, it can cause significant discomfort and negatively impact an individual's quality of life. The infection can be effectively treated with antibiotics, making it crucial for individuals displaying symptoms to consult their healthcare provider. Conclusion: As McDonald’s works to find an alternate supplier for its salad mixes, customers in affected locations must rely on other menu items for the time being. By taking this precautionary measure, the company aims to provide its consumers with the highest possible food safety standards and to prevent further occurrences of the cyclosporiasis outbreak. Health officials continue to investigate the issue and work toward identifying the source and scope of the problem, providing relevant updates as they become available."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While some people believe that women are more emotional than men, that is not necessarily the truth. Research has revealed that men and women simply process emotions differently. The types of situations that provoke an emotional response in women is different than that of men. Instead of dismissing a woman's emotional response, try to get an understanding of what is causing her response. One great benefit of relationships is that others may be strong where you are not so strong, which can be highly beneficial to your life. When you are honest about areas where the woman in your life is stronger, it can be of great benefit to you in the long run. Some women need personal time and space. How much varies, but generally speaking, you should not be intimated by phone calls and text messages from friends, nor should you feel compelled to monitor them. As long as you trust each other you should not worry about the time that she is away from you. You should also avoid being controlling and allow her to be her own person by not trying to dictate how she should live her life. There should be a mutual respect for each other's career without one person diminishing the other based on the nature of their job. If the woman makes more money, this should not cause a rift or any feelings of insecurity. Whether you are in a serious relationship or just friends, a good compliment is often appreciated. When complimenting a woman, be sincere and do not just focus on her physical attributes. There are many aspects of a woman besides her physical appearance that deserves attention. Consider complimenting her intelligence, sense of humor, creativity, cooking skills, or compassion for others.","completion":"This article highlights the importance of understanding and respecting the differences in emotional processing between men and women, fostering mutual trust and respect, avoiding controlling behaviors, appreciating each other's strengths, and offering genuine compliments beyond physical appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB.

Nuorten aktiivinen osallistuminen kansalaisyhteiskuntaan, politiikkaan ja yrittäjyyteen on erittäin tärkeää, sillä he ovat tulevaisuutemme rakentajia ja huomisen päättäjiä. Tässä tekstissä käsittelen muutamia tapoja, miten voimme rohkaista ja motivoida nuoria osallistumaan yhteiskunnalliseen keskusteluun, vaikuttaa politiikkaan ja kehittää omia liiketoimintaideoitaan. 1. Tarjoa informaatiota ja resursseja: Etenkin koulutuksessa on tärkeää välittää tietoa erilaisista yhteiskunnallisista ja poliittisista aihealueista ja aktiviteeteista. Oppilaitokset voivat järjestää esimerkiksi seminaareja, paneelikeskusteluja tai vierailuja järjestöihin ja politiikkaan, jotta nuoret voivat tutustua yhteiskunnallisiin ja poliittisiin prosesseihin. 2. Luo osallistumismahdollisuuksia: Tarjoa nuorille mahdollisuuksia osallistua yhteiskunnallisiin ja poliittisiin päätöksentekoprosesseihin ja järjestötoimintaan. Esimerkiksi paikalliset järjestöt ja nuorisovaltuustot voivat tarjota nuorille vaikuttamiskanavia omalla paikkakunnallaan. 3. Tuki ja mentorointi: Tarjoa nuorille tukiverkostoja ja mentorointia, joissa he voivat saada apua ja opastusta yhteiskunnalliseen ja poliittiseen osallistumiseen sekä yrittäjyyteen. Esimerkkejä tästä voivat olla yrittäjäkummit, mentorit, vertaisryhmät ja erilaiset tukiorganisaatiot. 4. Kannusta osallistumiseen: Rohkaise nuoria osallistumaan erilaisiin yhteiskunnallisiin ja poliittisiin tapahtumiin, keskusteluihin ja aktiviteetteihin. Tämä voi tarkoittaa esimerkiksi some-keskustelujen aktiivista seuraamista, äänestykseen osallistumista vaaleissa, yhteiskunnallisiin hankkeisiin osallistumista tai erilaisten tapahtumien järjestämistä. 5. Hyödynnä teknologiaa: Teknologia tarjoaa monipuolisia mahdollisuuksia nuorten osallistumisen edistämiseen. Digitaaliset alustat, some-kanavat ja verkkopalvelut voivat toimia tehokkaana välineenä yhteydenpidolle ja tiedon jakamiselle. 6. Korosta nuorten merkitystä: Muistuta nuoria heidän omasta tärkeydestään ja roolistaan yhteiskunnassa. Auta heitä ymmärtämään, että heillä on kyky vaikuttaa yhteiskunnan kehittymiseen ja heidän äänensä ansaitsee kuuluville. Näiden toimenpiteiden avulla voimme luoda kannustavan ja osallistavan ilmapiirin, jossa nuoret tuntevat olonsa turvalliseksi ja uskaltavat ottaa kantaa yhteiskunnallisiin ja poliittisiin asioihin sekä tarttua itseään kiinnostaviin liiketoimintamahdollisuuksiin.

A duel Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Steel Blossom: The Duel of Two Lives\\" In a world beautifully illustrated by the vibrant colors of the Edo period, a humble and peaceful carpenter, Hanshiro, lives a content life in a serene village. His days are occupied by crafting incredible sculptures, his nights filled with teaching his only son the arts of the samurai. A simple life with no need for disruption. Meanwhile, in Kyoto's imperial city, a striking contrast coexists, as the prodigal samurai Hikokuro, known for his invincibility, enjoys a life adorned with wealth, pride, and relentless ambition. Standing at the pinnacle of his power, Hikokuro continues to seek out challenges to assert his dominance and fulfill his unending thirst for supremacy. On a fateful day, Hikokuro visits the remote village where Hanshiro resides, having heard tales of an untrained warrior possessing extraordinary charisma and skill. Dismissing the rumors as idle talk of the peasants, he challenges Hanshiro to a duel, expecting an easy victory to reestablish the myth of his invincibility. Surprised yet undeterred by the unexpected challenge, Hanshiro accepts. After all, the path of the samurai is not just about the artistry of swordsmanship but also exemplifying bravery under adversarial circumstances. The challenge from Hikokuro provides him an opportunity to put an end to the tyrant's reign and bring peace to the rural communities living in fear of Hikokuro's wrath. As the news of the duel spreads across Japan, the fates of Hikokuro and Hanshiro become intertwined, their egos clash with each surge of their swords. The duel takes place at the break of dawn, against the picturesque backdrop of Mount Fuji, setting the stage for what would be one of the most legendary fights in history. The duel, expected to be over in a handful of minutes, prolongs into a grueling battle of willpower and perseverance. Hanshiro's vast experience and understanding of life's fragility, acquired through years of quiet labor and harmonious living, reflect in his strategy. Contrarily, Hikokuro's aggressive style, born out of his life-long thirst for acclaim, exposes his vulnerabilities. The underdog, schooled in humility, takes an unforeseen lead, drawing the blood first. Paralyzed by this unexpected turn, and weakened by his wounded pride, each movement becomes laborious for Hikokuro. The battleground echoes with the clanging of steel and the desperation of a wounded soul. \\"Steel Blossom: The Duel of Two Lives\\" culminates with an intense climax. Hikokuro, the undefeated samurai, in his dire attempt to regain control, lets his rage takeover. Yet, Hanshiro, who's fought not for pride or power but for peace, emerges victorious. This unexpected victory for Hanshiro sends ripples through the aristocracy and brings about a new era in the land, shifting power from the ruthless to the just. The movie symbolizes the struggle of an everyday man against oppressive power, gaining victory through humility and moral strength. It's a tale signifying that true power isn't about prowess or dominance, but understanding, humility, and the strength of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe. Please answer this question : Which sister had the same disease as the royal families of Europe did? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Mary, the twin sister who was diagnosed with hemophilia, had the same disease as the royal families of Europe did. Hemophilia is a group of hereditary diseases characterized by the body's inability to control blood clotting effectively. This condition can result in severe bleeding episodes that can be life-threatening, especially without proper treatment and management. The fact that it affected the royal families of Europe illustrates the hereditary nature of the disease, as it was passed down through generations, impacting the lives of many individuals within those families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. and the situation: Two sister countries used petroleum in different ways.

They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (sometimes also spelled Khalid Shaikh Mohammed; among at least fifty pseudonyms; born March 1, 1964) is an Islamist militant held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp under terrorism-related charges. He was named as \\"the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks\\" in the 9/11 Commission Report. Sheikh Mohammed was a member of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization, leading al-Qaeda's propaganda operations from around 1999 until late 2001. He confessed to FBI and CIA agents to a role in many of the most significant terrorist plots over the last twenty years, but his interrogators' use of enhanced interrogation techniques has caused some to question certain aspects of his confessions. By the time the Bojinka plot was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country's Ministry of Electricity and Water. He traveled in 1995 to Sudan, Yemen, Malaysia, and Brazil to visit elements of the worldwide jihadist community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations. On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama Bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi. After the US asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there. Bin Laden and his colleagues relocated their operations to Afghanistan at this time. Abu Hafs al-Masri/Mohammed Atef, bin Laden's chief of operations, arranged a meeting between bin Laden and Mohammed in Tora Bora sometime in mid-1996, in which Mohammed outlined a plan that would eventually become the quadruple hijackings of 2001. Bin Laden urged Mohammed to become a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda, but he continued to refuse such a commitment until around early 1999, after the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Mohammed moved his family from Iran to Karachi, Pakistan, in 1997. That year, he tried unsuccessfully to join mujahideen leader Ibn al-Khattab in Chechnya, another area of special interest to Mohammed. Unable to travel to Chechnya, he returned to Afghanistan. He ultimately accepted bin Laden's invitation to move to Kandahar and join al-Qaeda as a full-fledged member. Eventually, he became leader of Al Qaeda's media committee.

Please capitalize where necessary: this is how the collective consciousness is being raised, and since the collective consciousness creates our reality, a situation is being created in which ascension becomes possible for plenty of people.","completion":"This is how the Collective Consciousness is being raised, and since the Collective Consciousness creates our reality, a situation is being created in which Ascension becomes possible for plenty of people. The concept of Collective Consciousness refers to the shared beliefs, ideas, and moral attitudes that operate as unifying forces within a society. The idea is that the more people resonate with these shared aspects of consciousness, the more powerful and profound their effects become on reality. As individuals within a society are exposed to new ideas, their perspectives change, and the Collective Consciousness evolves over time. In the context of Ascension, which is a spiritual concept that involves the process of transcending to a higher state of consciousness, raising the Collective Consciousness is essential. With an increasingly harmonious and enlightened Collective Consciousness, individuals can more readily access deeper spiritual knowledge and experiences, thus enabling them to work towards personal and collective Ascension. To foster the raising of the Collective Consciousness, certain actions and practices can be undertaken. These may include: 1. Personal growth and reflection: Each person should engage in practices that promote self-awareness and spiritual development. Meditation, yoga, mindfulness, and various forms of energy work can help individuals align with higher states of consciousness. 2. Education and open-mindedness: Encouraging an environment of mutual learning and respect for differing perspectives can help broaden collective understanding. As more individuals gain knowledge on various topics related to spirituality, consciousness, and human existence, they may also develop more compassion and empathy, which ultimately contributes to the raising of the Collective Consciousness. 3. Sharing experiences and knowledge: By openly sharing our spiritual journeys with others, we encourage the spread of valuable insights and wisdom. This practice helps others to recognize patterns and associations within their own experiences, contributing to the expansion of awareness within the collective. 4. Supporting positive values and beliefs: Energies and intentions that are based on love, unity, compassion, and understanding can greatly influence the Collective Consciousness. By promoting these values and beliefs through personal actions and involvement in communities, we can help create a more harmonious and cooperative collective reality. 5. Engaging in collective meditation, prayer, and other practices: Group activities that focus on transmitting positive energies and intentions can contribute to the overall expansion of the Collective Consciousness. When a group of individuals come together with a shared intention for Ascension, their combined efforts can have a profound impact on the collective energy field. In conclusion, the capitalization of the relevant terms is as follows: Collective Consciousness and Ascension. By raising the Collective Consciousness through personal growth, open-mindedness, the sharing of experiences and knowledge, and support of positive values, the possibility of Ascension becomes a tangible reality for a significant number of people. It is essential for individuals to come together and participate in this transformative process in order to create a more compassionate and awakened society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

David says, \\"When I was at school I was hopeless.I could' t remember anything, but now I can remember more facts than anyone in Europe.\\" So how does Thomas do it? \\"One night I was watching a TV programme about an interview with a man called Dominic O'Brien, who had been the world memory champion five times.He used to be a gambler, and he wasn't particularly successful until he developed his own mnemonics, or mental memory aid, for each card in order to remember which cards had already been dealt and which ones hadn't.\\" Thomas became fascinated by O'Brien's theory that anyone can improve their memory by using specialized techniques.These techniques involve linking everything to familiar people or objects. \\"If you want to remember a phone number for example, you have to give the numbers life.Sometimes I associate a number with a person.Number 10 for me is always the Prime Minister (who lives at number 10 Downing Street) ,\\" explained David.If David is trying to remember facts he also links them to an image.\\"For instance, if I was trying to memorize the name 'Tom Cruise' , I would think of his film Top Cun, and that leads me to images of guns and cruise missiles.\\" is soon going to appear on TV's Record Breakers, and this week he is teaching memory training and speed - writing at Huddersfield University.His fees are PS600 a day.He is sure that the future holds a lot more for him than a job as a fire - fighter.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"It seems that the suggested answer does not directly address the question about the age of a child in relation to pedophile crimes. Let me provide you with a more suitable answer. The term pedophile refers to an adult who has a sexual preference for prepubescent children, generally ages 13 or younger. A pedophile crime occurs when an adult engages in sexual activities with a child under the legal age of consent as specified by a country's laws. The age of consent varies from country to country, but it typically ranges from 16 to 18 years old. In some cases, the age may be lower if certain conditions are met. In summary, the answer to the question should focus on the age of the child, which is generally under the legal age of consent and usually considered to be 13 or younger.

Article: Supporters of Chen Guangcheng have warned that his family and friends in China are still at risk after the blind activist arrived in New York to begin a new life in the United States. Chen — whose daring escape from house arrest last month prompted a diplomatic crisis — arrived on Saturday night to cheering crowds, and used his first speech to press for greater rule of law in the country he left behind. \\"I hope everybody works for me to promote justice and fairness in China,\\" Chen said through an interpreter, ahead of his enrolment for a fellowship in the US-Asia Law Institute at New York University School of Law. He was also careful to thank the Chinese government, knowing the wellbeing of relatives and associates could be influenced by an upcoming shift in the Communist party leadership. Instead, he criticised the provincial authorities in Shandong for years of persecution, including 18 months of house arrest, beatings and harassment of his relatives. Chen said \\"acts of retribution may not have abated\\" in his village of Dongshigu, which was still under lockdown. \\"We hope to see a thorough investigation into these events,\\" he said. The figurehead of the rights movement suggested his own role will temporarily diminish. \\"I am requesting leave of absence and I hope they will understand,\\" he said. \\"For the past seven years, I have never had a day's rest so I have come here for a bit of recuperation for body and spirit.\\" He Peirong – who played a key role in the escape by driving Chen from Shandong to Beijing – said she sympathised, even though the reverberations of Chen's flight remain unclear. \\"I support any decision made by Chen, but it's too early to say whether his departure is a good thing for China's rights movement. Things are not settled. Problems are not solved. His family is still in China. The people who helped him escape are still in China.\\" He – who was detained for several days after Chen's escape and remains under surveillance – spoke of her admiration for Chen. \\"He has done more than you could expect from any individual … Although he has experienced so much injustice and so many threats, he sticks to his beliefs. He is like a piece of jade: always smooth and warm.\\" Others supporters, relatives and lawyers, including Guo Yushan and Liu Weiguo, were not answering their phones. Several have been told not to speak to the foreign media. Zeng Jinyan, who met Chen before he took refuge at the US embassy, said her computer had been hacked and infected with a virus that made it difficult to communicate. Chen's nephew has been arrested and charged with attempted murder after using a kitchen knife to fight off local officials who intruded into his home. The activist's brother has described how he was chained to a chair and beaten for three days. His lawyer and friend, Jiang Tianyong, was punched so powerfully by state security officials that he lost his hearing. He said police continued to impose tight restrictions on rights activists and he expected the pressure to intensify ahead of a key party congress this autumn. \\"There won't be any big changes for us now that Chen Guangcheng has left. There are still many reasons to keep up control and stability preservation,\\" Jiang told Reuters. A supporter in Shandong told the news agency the authorities were unlikely to ease pressure any time soon. \\"The Communist party doesn't want to set a precedent over this case by easing up after a dissident has escaped detention,\\" said Sun Wenguang, a retired professor, who is monitored 24 hours a day by security officers. Although supporters in the US say Chen is now free to \\"speak truth to power'\\" it is far from clear that his voice will be any easier to hear in his homeland. In the past, Chinese dissidents who sought exile in the US have found their influence muted by distance and Beijing's \\"Great Firewall\\" – which filters internet content from overseas. Few are allowed to return. Last week, Wu'er Kaixi – the student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests – was refused permission to return to China to see his ailing parents. Nonetheless, Chen's escape could make a difference in China because of the timing. The ability of a blind man to evade dozens of guards raises awkward questions for party hardman Zhou Yongkang, who has a bigger budget for internal security than the People's Liberation Army has to protect China's borders. Zhou is due to step down this autumn. Chen's arrival in New York could also play in US politics and diplomatic strategy. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney had criticised the Obama administration's handling of the case when it was unclear whether Chen would leave China. But the Democrat former House speaker Nancy Pelosi described Chen's flight to the US as \\"a milestone in the cause for human rights in China\\". \\"The courage of Chen Guangcheng to risk his life and livelihood to advocate for disadvantaged people in China is an inspiration to freedom-seeking people around the world,\\" she said. Human rights campaigners warned against complacency. \\"Chen's departure for the US does not and should not in any way mark a 'mission accomplished' moment for the US government or any other government which values human rights and rule of law in China. The fact is that getting Chen Guangcheng and his family on a plane is the easiest part of this saga. The harder, longer term part is ensuring his right under international law to return to China when he sees fit,\\" said Phelim Kine, senior Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. ||||| The trip to New York ended an improbable journey that began in late April, when despite his lack of sight, Mr. Chen scaled the walls around his house, sneaked past the guards who held him captive and was whisked to Beijing by a human rights activist. American officials agreed to provide at least temporary shelter, but the pickup almost went awry: Chinese security cars trailed their vehicle, forcing them to sweep Mr. Chen into their car from another vehicle and race through the streets of the capital to the embassy. But the drama did not end there. Mr. Chen decided more than a week later to stay in China, only to change his mind several hours later when American officials left him at a hospital and friends expressed fears for his safety. That led to renewed negotiations and eventually to Saturday’s release. Now, after years of isolation — his every move at his home recorded by surveillance cameras — and serving time in a Chinese jail, Mr. Chen found himself at the center of a media frenzy generated by his release. Photo But the sudden ability to speak out was bittersweet, which he acknowledged in an interview on the plane. China has a pattern of allowing some especially vocal dissidents to leave the country in order to minimize the impact of their activism at home, and it is unclear if he will be able to effect change as easily from so far away, while he studies at New York University. “I don’t really feel that happy, but rather sentimental,” he said in the brief interview. “After all the suffering for years, I don’t have those tearful moments anymore, but I do feel something inside.” He looked calm, but his hands shook as he talked about leaving a country he has tried to change from within for years. “I’m very clear what kind of role I’m playing right now,” he said. “Opportunity and risk exist at the same time.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Washington, the State Department praised the Chinese government in a statement that reflected the United States’ handling of the case from the start: understated and nonconfrontational, despite the emotions and high stakes involved for both countries. “We also express our appreciation for the manner in which we were able to resolve this matter and to support Mr. Chen’s desire to study in the U.S. and pursue his goals,” the State Department’s spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said. Her statement referred to the complex understanding — the Chinese were loath to call it a deal — in which Mr. Chen will be allowed to attend law school on a fellowship rather than seek asylum, which the authorities in Beijing would have considered an affront. School officials said they had already stocked a faculty apartment with Chinese food and new furniture for him.

His departure from Beijing — after two weeks of waiting — avoided a major embarrassment for the Obama administration, which was criticized by Chinese activists and some Republicans in Congress who accused the administration of releasing Mr. Chen too quickly into Chinese custody and, they said, seeking an expedient solution to a nettlesome problem ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s visit to China in early May. Since then, activists have been mainly supportive of the United States’ efforts to help Mr. Chen. On Saturday, Mr. Chen left Beijing with his wife and two children, and like most events surrounding his case, the departure was shrouded in secrecy. Mr. Chen and his family said they did not know they were leaving the country until several hours before the flight, and it was only on their way to the airport that they learned where they were heading. The passports they had been awaiting were delivered by Chinese officials shortly before the family got on the United Airlines plane. Once on board, flight attendants promptly drew a curtain around their business class seats and barred other passengers in the cabin from using the bathroom while the plane was on the runway. Photo Speaking by cellphone before he boarded the flight, Mr. Chen told friends that he was excited to leave China but was worried about the fate of relatives left behind. Bob Fu, president of ChinaAid, a Christian advocacy group in Texas that championed Mr. Chen’s case, said, “He’s happy to finally have a rest after seven years of suffering, but he’s also worried they will suffer some retribution.” Mr. Chen and his family were driven directly to Beijing International Airport by employees of Chaoyang Hospital, where Mr. Chen had been treated for intestinal problems and for the foot he broke during his escape. . Mr. Chen, a self-taught lawyer blinded by childhood illness, was once toasted by the state news media for his advocacy of the disabled and the disenfranchised. But in 2005, he ran into trouble with the authorities by organizing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of thousands of women in Shandong Province who had been subjected to forced abortions and sterilizations. A year later, a local court sent him to prison for more than four years on charges that were widely seen as spurious. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Although technically a free man after his release in September 2010, Mr. Chen ran up against local officials who, with the backing of provincial authorities, turned his home into a makeshift prison, with hired guards and cellphone jamming equipment. In a homemade video that was smuggled last year out of the village where he lived and posted on the Internet, Mr. Chen and his wife detailed the indignities of their detention. Local officials responded with a vicious round of beatings. The cordon of security also kept out visitors, including journalists, diplomats and freelance Chinese activists, who were violently repelled when they tried to enter the village. Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher based in Hong Kong for Human Rights Watch , offered tempered praise on Saturday for the Chinese government’s handling of the episode but said he would reserve further judgment until the day Mr. Chen sought to return to China. Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor who helped arrange Mr. Chen’s fellowship, said he thought Beijing would be eager to blunt the domestic impact of Mr. Chen’s departure. “The last thing they want,” he said, “is for this deal to symbolize a way out of China for dissidents.” |||||Summary:","completion":"Supporters of Chen Guangcheng, a blind Chinese activist who recently arrived in New York, have warned that his family and friends in China are still at risk.

Jerome John Garcia (August 1, 1942 - August 9, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for his work as the lead guitarist and as a vocalist with the band Grateful Dead, which came to prominence during the counterculture era in the 1960s. Although he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \\"spokesman\\" of the group. One of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire thirty-year career (1965-1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders-Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). On August 9, 1995, at 4:23 am, eight days after his 53rd birthday, Garcia was found dead in his room at the rehabilitation clinic. The cause of death was a heart attack. Garcia had long struggled with drug addiction, weight problems, sleep apnea, heavy smoking, and diabetes--all of which contributed to his physical decline. Lesh remarked that upon hearing of Garcia's death, \\"I was struck numb; I had lost my oldest surviving friend, my brother.\\" Garcia's funeral was held on August 12, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Belvedere. It was attended by his family, the remaining Grateful Dead members, and their friends, including former basketball player Bill Walton and musician Bob Dylan. Deborah Koons barred Garcia's former wives from the ceremony. On August 13, approximately 25,000 people attended a municipally sanctioned public memorial at the Polo Fields of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Crowds produced hundreds of flowers, gifts, images, and a bagpipe rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" in remembrance. In the Haight, a single white rose was reportedly tied to a tree near the Dead's former Ashbury house, where a group of followers gathered to mourn. On the morning of April 4, 1996, after a total lunar eclipse earlier that day, Weir and Deborah Koons, accompanied by Sanjay Mishra, spread half of Garcia's ashes into the Ganges River at the holy city of Rishikesh, India, a site sacred to Hindus. The remaining ashes were poured into the San Francisco Bay. Koons did not allow former wife Carolyn Garcia to attend the spreading of the ashes.

SHAPE is the central command and planning center for NATO's military operations and is responsible for the overall strategic direction and guidance of NATO's military components. NATO was founded in 1949 as a military alliance between North American and European countries to provide collective defense against potential aggression from the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. In December 1950, SHAPE was established as an integral part of NATO to improve the integration and cooperation among the member countries' armed forces. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was a key figure in the success of the World War II-era Allied forces, was appointed as the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) to lead SHAPE and the integrated military structure of NATO. Today, SHAPE continues to play an essential role in maintaining the readiness and efficiency of NATO's armed forces, working closely with its member nations to execute a broad range of missions, including crisis management, cooperative security, and collective defense. The current headquarters of SHAPE is located in Mons, Belgium, and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe is responsible for commanding NATO's military forces across an area of responsibility that spans three continents, including Europe, America, and Africa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It looks like there are three different places where you have \\"y\\". We've got \\"-14*y\\", \\"-74*y\\", and \\"-107*y\\". If we add all of these together, it's like we're gathering all your y's in one place. This is our first step. So, let's add -14, -74, and -107 together. When we do that, we get -195. So, our equation now looks like this: 0 = -195*y - 1170. Now, in order to solve the problem, we have to isolate \\"y\\". To do this, we should move \\"-1170\\" over to the other side of the equation. This is similar to if you were to move a toy from one side of your room to the other. Instead of taking away -1170, you're going to add 1170 to both sides, because if you add something, it's like moving it to the other side. So, we get 1170 = -195*y. Next, we divide both sides of the equation by -195 to isolate \\"y\\". This is just like if you have 195 pieces of candy and you want to divide it evenly among your friends, you'd figure out how many each friend would get. So when we do that calculation, we find that -1170 divided by -195 equals 6. So, the solution to the equation is y = 6.

Your task requires determining if it can be concluded that \\"An adult and a child sitting on a police motorcycle\\" when given the statement \\"There are two people sitting down.\\" To analyze this, it is essential to break down both pieces of information and compare their contents. Firstly, the provided statement is \\"There are two people sitting down.\\" This information is quite general, as it indicates that two individuals are seated but does not specify the demographic characteristics of the subjects, such as their age or relationship to one another. Additionally, the statement does not provide any context regarding the location or situation in which they are seated. Now let's look at the conclusion we want to judge: \\"An adult and a child sitting on a police motorcycle.\\" This conclusion contains much more specific details, including the age/relationship between the individuals (an adult and a child) and the setting (on a police motorcycle). Based on the analysis, the statement offers only the number of people sitting and their position (seated), while the conclusion requires more precise details that are not provided. Thus, we cannot conclude that \\"An adult and a child sitting on a police motorcycle\\" based solely on the statement \\"There are two people sitting down.\\" Therefore, the answer is (II) it is not possible to tell.

Summarize: It is part of new measures to provide basic protection for some seven million domestic workers long excluded from Brazil's stringent labour laws. Employers can now be reported and fined several hundred dollars each time they break part of the code. A constitutional amendment limits domestic workers to a 44-hour week. It defined other rights as well - basic entitlements such as an eight-hour working day, the right to the minimum wage, a lunch break, social security and severance pay. Most of these changes have been implemented, but there are still challenges around the government severance fund into which employers have to pay 8% of their employee's total salary each month. If the employee is fired without just cause, the employer has to pay a lump sum worth 40% of the pot, plus an added 10% for the government. Discussions are continuing around how many months' pay workers will be entitled to if they are made redundant. The regulation of working hours has had a big impact. The new legislation has led to many families employing more people to do alternate shifts and some employers are doing more work themselves. But there are other factors too affecting the domestic worker labour market. The number of women choosing to go into domestic service is shrinking. This is because of better access to education and job opportunities particularly in the poor north-east of the country from where many people travelled in search of work. Domestic workers are asking for higher wages so for many in the middle class the live-in maid is no longer feasible. People are employing staff by the day and more household chores are being done by middle-class men and women who are also now buying more household appliances. Brazil has around 7m maids according to the International Labour Organisation, more than any other country in the world.

Essential oils can cause skin irritation and rashes if used directly on bare skin, so always dilute your oils first. If you've never used essential oils before, you may want to use diluted oils on a small portion of your skin. Watch for a reaction before massaging them elsewhere on your body. If you have an allergic reaction, you will notice red, flaky skin, pain, and irritation. Cease using the essential oils. The rash should clear up in a few days. Peppermint oil may be effective for treating some symptoms of indigestion. However, for specific health problems, peppermint oil may worsen symptoms. Peppermint oil can worsen the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and may make gallstones worse. Peppermint oil should not be used on children as it can inhibit breathing. There is not a lot of information on essential oils and pregnancy, so most healthcare providers advise that pregnant women err on the side of caution. It's best to avoid essential oils altogether during pregnancy. However, if you want to use aromatherapy anyway, stick to something like a bath, and only use a couple of drops of essential oils. Ingesting essential oils, or applying them directly to the skin, should be avoided. Parsley seed and pennyroyal oils may be particularly dangerous during pregnancy.

Title: Men in Black II Movie plot: Five years after the retirement of Agent K (Jones) from MIB, the secret New York City-based agency that monitors and regulates extraterrestrials residing on Earth, Agent J (Smith)âK's former partner and hand-picked replacementâis called to investigate the murder of an alien at his pizzeria. The waitress, Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), tells him that the murderers were Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), a shapeshifting Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad (Johnny Knoxville). Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MIB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories of the aliensâand of him. J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent Kâwho was neuralyzed when he retired, and remembers nothing of his MIB service. In Truro, Massachusetts, where K is now the town's postmaster, J explains this, and convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MIB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed; fortunately, Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K regains his memories, but it's not enough: Years before, he neuralyzed himself, specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returnedâbut as a precaution, he left himself a series of clues. At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with the worm aliens from the first movie. The key opens a locker in Grand Central Station where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: K's wristwatch and video store membership card. K recovers both, to the aliens' horror, but J gives them his watch as a replacement, and becomes their new deity. At the video store, as J and K...

Solve -44*r - 266 = -398 for r.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this equation step by step, like we're figuring out a puzzle. We have this equation: -44*r - 266 = -398 Now, we want to find the value of \\"r\\". Here's what we'll do: 1. First, we need to get rid of the -266 on the left side. So, we'll add 266 to both sides. This will help us isolate \\"r\\". So, we have: -44*r - 266 + 266 = -398 + 266 2. Now, the -266 and +266 on the left side will cancel each other out because they are opposite of each other. So, we'll have: -44*r = -132 3. Now, we need to get \\"r\\" by itself. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -44, because -44*r means -44 times r. So, we have: (-44*r) / -44 = -132 / -44 4. When we divide both numbers, -44 and -132, both negatives will cancel each other out (because a negative divided by a negative gives us a positive). So, we'll have: r = 3 There you go!

Process: - Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades - The shaft of the turbine spins - Shaft is connected to a generator - The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor - The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops inside - The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose low winds that day happens, how will it affect the rotor rotates more. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of wind turbine electricity generation. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that lower wind speeds on a particular day might impact the way the rotor rotates. Let's first understand the process in detail and then discuss the effects of low winds on the rotor and the electricity generation process. As mentioned in your description, when wind blows and passes through the turbines, it moves the blades, causing the shaft of the turbine to spin. The spinning shaft is connected to a generator or alternator, which is responsible for converting kinetic energy from the spinning motion into electrical energy. Typically, the generator consists of a rotor (rotating part) and a stator (fixed part). The rotor usually has one or more sets of magnets, while the stator has multiple wire windings or loops surrounding the magnets. When the rotor spins rapidly, it generates a rotating magnetic field inside the core. This magnetic field, in turn, induces an electric current in the coil windings of the stator. Now, let's discuss the effects of the perturbation hypothesis on this process: Direct Effect: Low wind speeds on a specific day will directly affect the rotation of the wind turbine blades, and consequently, the spinning speed of the shaft. This decrease in shaft rotation will, in turn, lead to a decline in the rotor's spinning speed. As the rotor relies on its speed to generate a strong magnetic field, low rotor speed would lead to a weak magnetic field. Consequently, the induced electric current in the stator coil windings will be lower, which will reduce the generated electrical energy. Indirect Effect: Apart from the direct effect on rotor rotation, low wind speeds could also influence factors such as the efficiency and stability of the wind turbine. Indirect effects include: 1. Efficiency: Modern wind turbines usually have an operational range, known as the cut-in and cut-out wind speeds. When the wind speed is too low, the turbine will not produce any electricity. On the other hand, when the wind speed is too high, the turbine will shut down to prevent any mechanical damage. It's important for the wind turbine to remain within this range to operate efficiently. Low wind speeds could impact the overall efficiency of the turbine in generating electricity. 2. Turbulence: Low wind speeds may cause turbulence and variability in wind conditions. This could lead to fluctuating power output, which may affect the overall rotor performance and, subsequently, the amount of electricity generated. 3. Maintenance and Load: When wind speeds change significantly, it causes stress on the mechanical components of the wind turbine. Consequently, the fluctuating load and stress may increase the maintenance requirements and impact the long-term reliability and lifespan of the turbine system. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does impact the wind turbine's electricity generation process directly by affecting the rotor's spinning speed and, consequently, the amount of electricity generated. Moreover, it indirectly affects the overall efficiency, stability, and maintenance of the wind turbine system. To mitigate the impacts of low wind speeds, modern wind turbines are designed with better aerodynamics, advanced control systems, and predictive wind behavior analysis to optimize their performances under varying wind conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

Premise: \\"The comment received in response to the IRFA concerned the impact of the proposed rule on small entities that manage funds regulated under ERISA.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"No comments were received in response to the IRFA.\\"?","completion":"If the premise is true, stating that \\"The comment received in response to the IRFA concerned the impact of the proposed rule on small entities that manage funds regulated under ERISA,\\" it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"No comments were received in response to the IRFA.\\" By analyzing the premise, we can draw several conclusions: 1. There was at least one comment received in response to the IRFA (Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis). The IRFA is a process to ensure that regulatory bodies assess the potential impact of their proposed actions, specifically on small entities. The existence of a comment in response to the IRFA confirms that there was public or stakeholder involvement in the process. 2. The comment was about the impact of the proposed rule on small entities that manage funds regulated under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974). ERISA is a United States federal law that governs and protects the retirement benefits of private-sector employees. The comment suggests that there were concerns about the potential consequences this specific rule might have on the management of such funds and, in turn, possibly affecting the employees relying on these funds for retirement. 3. Since the premise states that the comment was concerning ERISA-regulated funds, we can infer that the proposed rule had potential implications on pensions, retirement funds, or other benefit programs covered under ERISA. This also suggests that the commenter (or commenters) had an interest in the financial well-being and protection of private-sector employees, as per the ERISA guidelines. Given this information, the hypothesis \\"No comments were received in response to the IRFA\\" is false in the context of the provided premise. There was at least one comment received, addressing the impact of the proposed rule on small entities managing ERISA-regulated funds. This demonstrates that stakeholder participation contributed to the IRFA process in this instance, representing an effort to account for concerns and potential effects on the involved entities and individuals before finalizing the rule."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: Country is facing second snap election in a year after party in ruling coalition quits over alleged cover-up involving PM’s father Iceland will face its second snap election in a year after one of the three parties in its ruling coalition said it was quitting because of a “serious breach of trust” over the alleged cover-up of a scandal involving the prime minister’s father. The Bright Future party said on its Facebook page that it had “decided to terminate cooperation with the government”, effectively bringing down Bjarni Benediktsson’s administration barely nine months after it was formed. The prime minister told reporters: “We have lost the majority and I don’t see anything that indicates we can regain that … I am calling an election.” He added that he would prefer the vote to take place in November. The walkout follows reports that Benediktsson’s Independence party tried to conceal a letter written by his father, Benedikt Sveinsson, to help a friend convicted of child sexual offences have his criminal record cleared. The justice minister, Sigridur Andersen, of the Independence party, told Benediktsson of the letter in July but the government did not publicly disclose its existence until forced to do so by a parliamentary committee this week. Sveinsson’s letter recommended that his friend Hjalti Sigurjón Hauksson, sentenced to five years in prison in 2004 for repeatedly raping his stepdaughter for 12 years since the age of five, should have his “honour restored”. The widely criticised Icelandic legal procedure restores the “civil standing” of people who have served sentences for serious offences – allowing them, for example, to apply for certain jobs – without erasing their criminal records. One requirement for the status is a letter of recommendation from a close friend. The Reform party, the third member of the coalition formed after elections last year, triggered by the collapse of the previous government following the Panama Papers offshore tax revelations, also said it backed a fresh vote. “In light of the situation, the Reform party believes the right thing to do is to call an election immediately,” it said in a statement. Bright Future’s chair, Guðlaug Kristjánsdóttir, called the latest scandal “the last straw”. Sveinsson confirmed on Friday that he had signed a letter supporting his friend’s application and said he had not discussed it with anyone. “I did not think of it as something that would justify Hjalti’s position,” he said. “I never considered ‘restored honour’ as anything but a legal procedure making it possible for convicted criminals to regain some civil rights.” Sveinsson added: “I would like to apologise to all those who have been hurt because of the matter.” ||||| COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Iceland's president on Saturday accepted the resignation of the volcanic island's prime minister, who says a new election mostly likely will be held on Nov. 4. Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson lost his nine-month-old, center-right coalition after one party quit over an attempt by the prime minister's father to help clear the name of a convicted pedophile. President Gudni Th. Johannesson met Saturday with Benediktsson and was meeting with other party leaders later in the day. A small centrist party, Bright Future, quit the ruling coalition Friday after it emerged that Benediktsson's father had written a letter urging a pardon for Hjalti Sigurjon Hauksson, who was convicted in 2004 of raping his stepdaughter almost every day for 12 years. Under Iceland's judicial system, a person who has served a sentence for a serious crime can apply to authorities to \\"restore their honor\\" and seek employment again, meaning their criminal record is erased. For that, a letter of recommendation by a close friend or an associate is needed. Benediktsson took office in January, uniting his Independence Party, the Reform Party and the centrists. Together they held the slimmest of majorities — 32 of the 63 seats in parliament following the Oct. 29 election, which was called after the former prime minister resigned amid protests over his offshore holdings that were revealed in the Panama Papers leak. When it emerged that some government members had kept information from the public about the letter seeking to clear Hauksson's record, Bright Future said it was quitting. Benediktsson said Friday that some Icelandic laws were \\"completely out of sync with modern values,\\" according to the nation's largest newspaper Morgunbladid. He was quoted as saying he was \\"in shock\\" when he heard about the letter. Benediktsson, a former finance minister, was also named in the Panama Papers as having held a stake in a Seychelles-based investment company. Iceland is a wind-lashed island near the Arctic Circle with a population of 320,000. The country suffered through years of economic upheaval after its debt-swollen banks collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis but now is experiencing a surge in tourism by those eager to see its pristine glaciers, fjords and waterfalls and the Northern Lights. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Ok, let me explain this in simple words. Iceland, a country with big mountains and beautiful nature, has been having some problems with their leaders. A man named Bjarni Benediktsson was the person in charge of the country, called the Prime Minister. But his friends in the government found out that his father tried to help someone who did very bad things. After they found out about this, Bjarni's friends didn't want to work with him anymore, so they left the group that was in charge. So now, they have to choose new leaders for the country, and they will do this by having people in Iceland vote for who they want. This will be the second time they have to vote for new leaders in just one year, which is very unusual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the daytime I ran by her side and at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot, we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees and when it was cold, we had a nice warm wooden house. As soon as I was old enough to eat grass, my mother used to go out to work during the daytime and come back in the evening. There were six young colts in the field besides me; they were older than I; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together in the field. Sometimes we had rather play rough, for others would frequently bite, kick as well as gallop. One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother came to me and said, \\"I expect you to pay attention to what I am going to say. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are cart horse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born.

How is \\"A Turkish house\\" said in Russian?","completion":"In Russian, \\"A Turkish house\\" is translated as \\"Турецкий дом\\" (Turetskiy dom). Here, \\"Турецкий\\" (Turetskiy) means \\"Turkish,\\" and \\"дом\\" (dom) means \\"house.\\" The Russian language is a Slavic language and is the most widely spoken one among the East Slavic languages. It uses the Cyrillic alphabet which is different from the Latin alphabet used in the English language. Therefore, when learning or translating words from one language to another, it is important to be familiar with the alphabet system being used to correctly write and pronounce the words in the target language. In terms of pronunciation, \\"Турецкий дом\\" (Turetskiy dom) can be pronounced as follows: - Турецкий (Turetskiy): \\"too-RETS-kee\\" - дом (dom): \\"dom\\" When speaking or writing in Russian, it is crucial to pay attention to grammar, case inflections, and the proper use of adjectives and nouns. For instance, adjectives in Russian agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case. Since \\"дом\\" (dom) is a masculine noun, the adjective \\"Турецкий\\" (Turetskiy) should be in its masculine form as well. It is noteworthy that Russian is an inflected language, and due to its complex grammar system, it's important to pay attention to the context in which a word or phrase is used. The meaning and translation might change depending on the context.

Shinedown is an American rock band from Jacksonville, Florida formed by singer Brent Smith in 2001 after the dissolution of his previous band. Smith, still under contract with record label Atlantic Records, recruited the band's original lineup of Jasin Todd as guitarist, Brad Stewart on bass, and Barry Kerch on drums. Consistent for the first two album cycles, a few lineup changes followed in the late 2000s, eventually stabilizing with Smith and Kerch alongside Zach Myers on guitar and Eric Bass on bass. The group has released five studio albums: Work on a fourth studio album began in February 2011, with the band spending the first half of the year writing and demoing over 33 songs. The band again decided to work with Cavallo as a producer, but moved into a new sound and lyrical direction on the album, capturing a more of a message of \\"empowerment, perseverance, and inspiration\\", inspired by Smith's then-recent change of getting sober and living a healthier lifestyle, and the new band members contributing to the writing process for the first time on an album. The recording process wrapped up about a year later in February 2012, and the album, Amaryllis, was released the next month, on March 27, 2012, in 30 countries simultaneously, through a joint release between Atlantic and Roadrunner Records in countries Atlantic did not distribute into. Amaryllis debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 106,000 copies in its opening week. While the opening sales doubled the debut of The Sound of Madness, overall sales fell well short, with the album only being certified Gold, indicating a half million copies sold. Five singles were released from the album: \\"Bully\\", \\"Unity\\", \\"Enemies\\", \\"I'll Follow You\\", and \\"Adrenaline\\". The band's singles once again fared well, albeit it slightly below The Sound of Madness singles; \\"Bully\\" and \\"Unity\\" topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Charts, \\"Enemies\\" and \\"I'll Follow You\\" peaked at number 2, and \\"Adrenaline\\" peaked at number 4. Additionally, only \\"Bully\\" managed to have any cross-over success, break into the Billboard Top 100 chart, at number 94. and eventually being certified Gold as well. Shinedown also contributed the non-album song titled \\"I'm Alive\\" to the soundtrack of the 2012 film The Avengers. In November 2012, Smith announced in an NME interview that a follow up Shinedown album had already been recorded. Smith stated \\"We've actually, we have another record of material. It's actually recorded...It's still very massive, it still has an epic feel to it all, but the tempo is a little slower, and the subject matter is a little different. I would say it's actually a bit darker, a little bit more mischievous.\\" Despite the announcement, the band proceeded to move continue on with the Amaryllis touring cycle, touring through 2013 to complete another two year touring cycle. Shinedown and Three Days Grace embarked on a co-headlined tour beginning in February 2013, and went on another iteration of the yearly \\"Carnival of Madness\\" tour with Papa Roach in later 2013. In April 2013, Smith and Myers recorded ten acoustic cover songs, selected out of a pool of over 4,000 fan requests, selecting a variety of different types of songs, from Metallica's \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" to Adele's \\"Someone Like You\\". The tracks were released across two separate EPs, Acoustic Sessions on January 28, 2014, and Acoustic Sessions Pt. 2 on March 28, 2014, with performance videos created for every track on the first EP. The band took much of 2014 off, a rarity for the band, which had pretty consistently moved back and forth between recording and touring for each album cycle.

As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. - North Gyeongsang Province (RR: Gyeongsangbuk-do), also known as Gyeongbuk, is a province in eastern South Korea.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. 1). no 2). yes","completion":"Before examining the impact of the ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes in the Indian economy, let's first verify if the two questions provided are the same: Question 1: How will the ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes impact the Indian economy? Question 2: Now that Modi govt has decided to stop circulation of Rs.500 & 1000 notes, how will this impact the Indian economy? Comparison: Both questions are asking about the impact of the ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes on the Indian economy. The only difference between them is that Question 2 provides context that this decision was made by the Modi government. Therefore, the answer is: 2). yes Now, let's move on to explaining the impact of this decision on the Indian economy: The ban on Rs 500 and 1000 notes, also known as demonetization, was implemented by the Indian government with the intent to tackle the issues of corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency. Full analysis would require a deeper study of the subject, but here are some initial potential impacts on the economy: 1. Disruption in cash-based transactions: The sudden ban of these higher denomination notes caused a temporary shortage of cash in circulation. As India is predominantly a cash-driven economy, this affected both businesses and consumers. 2. Increased tax compliance: Demonetization forced people to deposit their high denomination currency notes into banks. This allowed the government to track income and wealth sources, leading to improved tax compliance and potentially higher tax revenue. 3. Shift towards digital payments: Demonetization created an environment where people were encouraged to adopt digital payment methods, reducing the dependency on cash transactions and pushing the economy towards digital transactions and financial inclusion. 4. Impact on GDP growth: The initial disruption from demonetization caused a short-term slowdown in India's economic growth. It was reported that GDP growth slowed in the immediate quarters following the announcement, but later recovered. 5. Inflation: There was a temporary decrease in inflation as cash was in short supply, but this effect was short-lived as liquidity was eventually restored to the market. While there are opposing viewpoints on the long-term benefits of demonetization, the immediate impact included short-term disruption in cash-based transactions, a push towards digital payments, and an increase in tax compliance. The effect on GDP growth and inflation was temporary and normalcy was restored in due course."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you sit down next to a stranger and start talking to them about their soul, there's a chance they'll be alarmed enough to move away from you. Similarly, if you approach a family member or a close friend and start talking about your faith without any lead-in, they might be somewhat put off. Instead, spend some time having a normal conversation with the person. If you're talking to someone you don't know well, make normal small talk about subjects like their family, hobbies, or career. If you're spending time with someone you're already close to, try asking them about things that you know have been going on in their life, or touch base on something you talked about the last time you saw them. Some conversations might never go farther than this, and that's fine. However, continue to pray that God will help you look for signs that a person would be open to a spiritual conversation, and that He'll give you the courage to be a witness for Him. Jesus' message of hope, love, and forgiveness are extremely powerful, especially to someone who's struggling to find their place in life. If you're talking to someone who seems to be deeply sad, anxious, or fearful, even if they're cheerful on the surface, they might be open to hearing God's word. For instance, you might hear a friend say something like, “I just don't know what I'm going to do with my life. My career didn't work out like I thought it would, and my relationships have all been disasters.” The message that God has a plan for their life might give them hope. You might also hear someone say, “I feel worried all the time and I don't know why.” In that case, the person might be open to God's message of hope and peace. Other conversations that might lead to a discussion of God could include comments about what happens after people die, feeling a lack of connection to the world around them, or even who created nature or mankind. Sometimes, it can seem insensitive if you quote Scripture as a blanket answer to someone's struggles, especially if they're opening up to you in a vulnerable and candid way. Try to talk to the individual in a way that's personal and sympathetic, allowing them to feel God's love through you. That will be much more effective than saying, \\"The Bible says that God loves you.\\" If a friend or loved one is severely depressed and you're concerned they might hurt themselves, call for emergency help. Once they're out of danger, you may be able to share your faith as a way to help them heal their inner pain, but it's important to have professionals help someone who's in crisis. If you live in the US, call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. You can also see a list of international hotlines by visiting https://ibpf.org/resource/list-international-suicide-hotlines. As with any type of conversation, the exact way you'll do this will depend on what you and the other person are talking about. Try to let the conversation develop organically, and pray for guidance, wisdom, and sensitivity as you move forward. In the case of the friend who's concerned about their career and failed dating attempts, you might say something like, “I really believe that God has a plan for your life. It might not seem like it now, but He can do great things in your life if you trust Him.” If you're talking to your friend who's always worried, you might say, “My relationship with God has really helped me handle all the stress in my life. I still get overwhelmed sometimes, but praying gives me a lot of peace. Is it okay if I share my story with you?” While you're sharing Jesus' story of resurrection and redemption, remember to treat the other person with respect. Don't talk down to them, belittle their beliefs, or discount their opinions, whether you agree with what they're saying or not. Instead, open yourself to learning from their struggles and experience, while remaining firm in your own faith. Leave it up to God to show the person which of their specific behaviors are sinful. Avoid judging the person or criticizing the way that they live, although you can point out that they—like everyone else—have likely committed a sin or two throughout their lives. Unfortunately, some people are predisposed to be closed off to God's message. They may have had hurtful encounters with religious people in the past, or they may simply have a negative view of the church. If you sense that the person is hostile towards your message, gently change the subject. You're more likely to leave the person with a good impression by handling the situation with grace and kindness, rather than by trying to force them to listen to what you have to say. If the person seems receptive to your message, or if they have a neutral response, you can move forward with sharing your witness. God's message of forgiveness is a beautiful story, although a frank discussion of sin can be very uncomfortable. Try to channel God's love for the person as you're talking to them, keeping the focus on the story of redemption and sacrifice. You might say something like, “I believe that God sent His son Jesus to earth, and Jesus died on the cross to save us from our sins. I get a lot of peace from my relationship with God, and I'd love to share that with you.” Then, tell them more about Jesus' life and death, based on your studying of the Scripture. It can often be very effective to share your own story of how you were saved, rather than just explaining the message in an abstract way. Avoid using in-depth theological terms the person might be unfamiliar with. Instead, stick to simple, everyday language. Try to approach every opportunity to witness with humility, patience, and kindness. Once you've presented the story of Jesus to the other person, it's up to the Holy Spirit and that person whether they're going to accept. If they do want to repent of their sins and follow Jesus, you can lead them in a simple prayer. However, keep in mind that your intention is just to be a vessel for God to work through, so don't take it personally if they say no. If they do want to pray, ask them to say something like, “Dear Lord, I know I am not perfect. I want to turn my life over to Jesus and have a personal relationship with God. Thank you for loving me, and please forgive me for my sins. Amen.” After the person prays, encourage them to get baptized and start attending a church where they feel comfortable.","completion":"This article talks about how to start a conversation with someone about your faith in a gentle and respectful way.

If they seem to be struggling or worried, they might be more open to hearing about your faith. When talking about your faith, try to be kind, loving, and humble. Don't judge or criticize the person, but instead show them God's love. If they want to learn more, share your own story of how your faith has helped you in your life.

Test sentence: \\"Martha climbed up the mountain.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","completion":"Yes, the test sentence \\"Martha climbed up the mountain.\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. Let me provide a detailed breakdown of this sentence to demonstrate why this is the case: 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is \\"Martha,\\" a proper noun that denotes a specific person. Proper nouns begin with capital letters, which is true in this instance. The subject is crucial in a sentence as it specifies who or what the sentence is about. In this case, the sentence is about \\"Martha.\\" 2. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"climbed,\\" which is an action verb portraying the action performed by the subject. The verb is in the simple past tense, indicating that the action has already taken place. The subject-verb agreement is proper in this sentence: \\"Martha\\" is singular, and the verb \\"climbed\\" is congruent with the singular subject. A correct verb tense and a proper subject-verb agreement are important aspects of a grammatically sound sentence. 3. Prepositional phrase: \\"Up the mountain\\" is a prepositional phrase that provides additional information about the action (verb) in the sentence. In this case, it gives more details about where the climbing occurred. The preposition \\"up\\" introduces the prepositional phrase, and \\"the mountain\\" is the object of the preposition. The phrase as a whole serves as an adverb modifying the verb \\"climbed.\\" Prepositional phrases are useful in adding context and specificity to a sentence. 4. Punctuation: The sentence ends with a period, which is appropriate for a declarative sentence that makes a statement or provides information. The period signals the end of the sentence, allowing the reader or listener to absorb the information before proceeding. In summary, the test sentence \\"Martha climbed up the mountain.\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence as it contains a clear subject, a proper subject-verb agreement, an accurate verb tense, a prepositional phrase that adds context, and appropriate punctuation.

The charity said there were a further six confirmed or probable cases in the town of Isiro. The outbreak, involving the Bundibugyo strain, was first reported last week after one person had died. Last month an outbreak of a more deadly ebola strain in neighbouring Uganda killed 16 people. The DR Congo outbreak occurred in Oriental province, which shares a border with Uganda. Medicins sans Frontieres (MSF) has said that the two outbreaks may not be related. It is not clear when exactly the deaths in Isiro occurred. A medical coordinator for MSF, Anja de Weggheleire, told the BBC the Bundibugyo strain was still dangerous, if less fatal than the one detected in Uganda. \\"It is normally less mortal and less virulent then the one we have seen in other places... But still it stays a very dangerous and mortal disease... we expect normally figures around 25 to 35% mortality,\\" Ms Weggheleire said. The charity says its staff in the affected area in north-east DR Congo are taking measures to locate and isolate anyone who has been in contact with those infected. Experts have said that Isiro's position as a transit point could make an outbreak more challenging to control. The virus, which is transmitted to humans from both monkeys and birds, causes massive internal bleeding and has a very high mortality rate. It is one of the most virulent diseases in the world and is spread by close personal contact. There is no vaccine for the virus and symptoms of infection include a sudden onset of fever, weakness, headache, vomiting and kidney problems. Summary:","completion":"An Ebola outbreak in DR Congo involving the Bundibugyo strain has resulted in 13 deaths, with six additional confirmed or probable cases in Isiro, while the charity Medicins sans Frontieres is working to isolate those affected and control the spread of the virus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

It is the disease that is now responsible for one in four deaths in the Western world. Now, what may be the oldest case of cancer has been discovered in a 4,500-year-old skeleton. Archaeologists say that a Siberian man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer, as revealed by tell-tale marks on his bones. Earliest victim? What may be the oldest case of cancer has been discovered in a 4,500-year-old skeleton (pictured). Archaeologists say that a Siberian man succumbed to either lung or prostate cancer, as revealed by tell-tale marks on his bones. The early Bronze Age man's remains were exhumed from a small hunter-gatherer cemetery in the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia. ‘This represents one of the earliest cases of human cancer worldwide and the oldest case documented thus far from Northeast Asia,’ said Angela Lieverse, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Older skeletons believed to be between 5,000 and 6,000 years old have yielded similar discoveries, but cancers were unconfirmed or tumours were found to be benign. Analysing the Russian remains with Daniel Temple from George Mason University in Virginia and Vladimir Bazaliiskii with Irkutsk State University in Russia, Dr Lieverse discovered that the cancer had riddled the ancient man’s bones with from head to hip, including his upper arms and upper legs, and virtually all points between. As he lay dying, severe pain and fatigue would have been his constant companions, punctuated by periods of panic as he struggled to breathe, she said. The man's age, sex and lesions on his bones point to lung cancer ( a magnified human lung cancer cell is shown) or possible prostate cancer for his cause of death. Experts found the cancer had riddled the ancient man’s bones with from head to hip, including his upper arms and upper legs, and virtually all points between. The man’s community buried him in a foetal position in a circular pit after he died, according to the research published in the journal, Plos One. The cancer victim was buried with an ornamental bone and a bone spoon, intricately carved with a winding serpent handle. Ancient skeletons bearing the scars of cancer are rare, leading some people to believe that the disease is a recent phenomenon caused by our modern lifestyles. However, this find provides evidence that refutes this hypothesis. Dr Lieverse suspects that taking into account variables such as longer life expectancies, cancer may have been considerably more common in ancient times than is generally presumed. ‘As we become more familiar with what metastatic carcinoma looks like in the skeleton, the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research is likely to increase,’ she said. He is thought to have been between 35 and 40 years old when he died. This burial differed from most men’s of the period, who were typically laid to rest on their backs with fishing or hunting gear. The researchers performed a battery of tests on the man, as if he had died recently and ruled out the possibility that he had died from tuberculosis or fungal diseases. They said that the most likely culprit was metastatic carcinoma – cancer that starts in one part of the body and spreads. ‘It’s clear the disease had progressed considerably, metastasising far beyond its original location in the body and contributing to his death,' Dr Lieverse said. ‘His age and sex and the lesions on his bones point to lung cancer or possibly prostate cancer.’ The early Bronze Age man's remains were exhumed from a small hunter-gatherer cemetery near Lake Baikal (shown on the map) in the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia. Ancient skeletons bearing the scars of cancer are rare, leading some people to believe that the disease is a recent phenomenon caused by our modern lifestyles. The Bronze Age man lived in a mountainous region with freshwater lakes and would have eaten a healthy diet of fish, game and fresh seasonal plants. However, this find provides evidence that refutes this hypothesis. Dr Lieverse suspects that taking into account variables such as longer life expectancies, cancer may have been considerably more common in ancient times than is generally presumed. ‘As we become more familiar with what metastatic carcinoma looks like in the skeleton, the number of cases identified by bioarchaeological research is likely to increase,’ she said. ‘A related example is scurvy.

By encouraging her to sing \\"Hound Dog\\". Answer:","completion":"Title: The Soulful Redemption Introduction: In a small town in Georgia, amidst the 1950s, music and self-expression are considered the ultimate form of freedom. Many passionate musicians gather at the town's community center to express themselves, but for Lewellen (played by Emma Stone), singing was a dream never dared to chase due to her controlling and abusive father. Charles (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a talented musician and the lead singer of the community center's band. It all takes a turn once Charles crosses paths with Lewellen and recognizes her hidden passion for singing. This sparks a deep connection between them, and Charles stands firm on a mission to rescue her from her sordid life. Plot Outline: 1. The film opens with Charles and his band performing at the community center. The atmosphere is electric, and the crowd is immersed in the music. An air of pure joy and passion floats through the room. Afterwards, the musicians interact with each other discussing their dreams and exchanging experiences. 2. Lewellen watches her first live performance from a distance, without her father knowing. She is captivated by Charles and the world of music, envying the freedom and happiness it brings. On her way back home, she secretly hums the tunes she heard, which catches the attention of Charles, who is leaving the community center. 3. Charles and Lewellen strike up an unlikely friendship as they bond over their shared love for music. Charles recognizes the hidden talents in Lewellen, as she softly hums to the tunes he plays on his guitar, and he feels a strong urge to help her break free from her confines and realize her dreams. 4. Lewellen's father (played by John Goodman) is a strict and domineering man who despises music and punishes Lewellen every time he catches her humming along to a tune on the radio. He controls every aspect of her life, leaving her shattered and caged. 5. Charles decides to enter the town's annual talent show with his band and wants Lewellen to sing as the lead vocalist. Although initially hesitant, Lewellen finally agrees to practice for the show in secret. Charles introduces Lewellen to the songs they would be performing, including Elvis Presley's iconic \\"Hound Dog.\\" As they practice, Lewellen's confidence skyrockets, and her passion for singing is reignited. 6. As the talent show approaches, Lewellen's father grows increasingly suspicious of her clandestine behavior. He follows her to her secret practice spot – an abandoned barn – and catches her singing along with Charles. Furious, he drags her back home, restricts her movements, and warns her of the impending doom if she disobeys him again. 7. During the final rehearsals for the talent show, Charles and the band members notice Lewellen's absence. The bandleader (played by Billy Bob Thornton) convinces Charles to give up on Lewellen, stating that they could find another singer. However, Charles refuses and ventures into the talent show alone, uncertain about Lewellen's fate. 8. It's the night of the talent show, and the audience eagerly awaits the performance of Charles and his band. As Charles steps onto the stage, he announces that they will be singing \\"Hound Dog\\" and dedicates the night's performance to Lewellen. As the band starts playing, Lewellen, who has escaped her father's clutches and made her way to the show, hears her cue and rushes to the stage. 9. With a newfound confidence and determination to reclaim her life, Lewellen grabs the microphone and starts singing, much to the audience's delight. Her powerful voice and stage presence make her an instant hit, and her father, standing in the crowd, watches in shock as his control over her withers away. 10. The film concludes with Lewellen's triumphant performance and the town celebrating their victory at the talent show. Charles's unwavering belief in Lewellen's musical abilities and his encouragement to sing \\"Hound Dog\\" has finally led to her rescue, breaking free from her father's grasp. As they leave the stage and embrace, their lives seem intertwined, and the prospects of newfound freedom and dreams chase away the shadows of Lewellen's past. \\"The Soulful Redemption\\" blends the spirit of an uplifting musical with the heartfelt journey of one woman's struggle and eventual redemption. The story showcases the healing power of music and the unmatched strength of human connection, illustrating how a song can change lives and, in Lewellen's case, save one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the following context: Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.The local board was reconstituted as an urban district council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936; Timperley Civil Parish was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham UD. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added. In 1937 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough. The new borough was granted armorial bearings which featured heraldic references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford. With the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative counties and municipal boroughs were abolished and Altrincham became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974.Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education,... answer the following question: What is the full name of the authority whose responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs?

Summarize the following: If you are already friends and want to take things to the next level, then ignore this step. However, if you just met or are only casual acquaintances, spend time together in a group or ask her out indirectly. This might require you to have a good opener or conversation starter. Start with a pre-opener: whenever you see her, make eye contact, smile, and say “hi”. Next, start a general conversation. Compliment her on her achievements, or ask about her interests (music, movies, books, hobbies, etc.). Use this general conversation as a starting point for developing a closer relationship based on common interests and/or shared goals. Be patient. Some girls are naturally more open about themselves and talkative, whereas others might be more shy or hesitant at first. Never use cheesy pick-up lines. Not only does this set a bad impression, but it can also be offensive. You can be upfront and ask her out directly, or use a more indirect approach such as asking what she is doing this weekend and if she has any plans. Which approach you choose depends on the situation and personalities. Other indirect examples include: asking whether she's been to a certain restaurant, and wondering if she wants to check it out with you; or phrase it as an opportunity, such as “we are both free this weekend and the weather looks nice, so why don't we do something together”. Remember, at this stage you are only asking her to go on a date (to a movie, concert, dinner, etc.), not if she wants to be your girlfriend. Make it clear you just want to hang out. Don't talk about relationships or ask her to be your girlfriend. Do not corner a girl or make her feel trapped (physically) when asking her out. She might say no because she feels uncomfortable and intimidated. If she seems reluctant to go on a date with you, invite her to do something with a group of friends. Organize a picnic or go to a dinner and a movie with a couple friends. On your first date (or first time you hang out), your goals should be to make sure she has a good time, you express your feelings in a way that are clear but not over the top, and you do not try anything too extravagant, expensive, or romantic. Go on a group date or do something in a public place rather than inviting her to spend time with you alone. Take the lead in deciding what you will do and where you will go on the date. Do your homework – ask her if she has any food preferences, make reservations if necessary, and avoid places that are upscale and pricey. Make an effort with your appearance – wash and comb your hair, brush your teeth, do not wear too much cologne, and wear clean, unwrinkled clothes. Do not overindulge in alcohol, be considerate, and practice good manners. These involve not dominating the conversation, turning off your phone and giving her your full attention, and be kind to others. Avoid discussing controversial topics, such as politics, old relationships, complaining about your job, or sex. Instead, focus on good topics such as the news (and her opinion on current events), family, travel (either places you've been or want to go in the future), or your thoughts on love and what makes a good relationship. Summary:","completion":"To progress from acquaintances to a closer relationship, begin by establishing a connection through general conversation, discussing interests, achievements, and shared goals. Be patient, as some individuals may be more hesitant to open up. Avoid cheesy pick-up lines, and choose a direct or indirect approach when asking her out, depending on the situation and personalities involved. Initially, focus on group dates or public activities to make her feel comfortable, taking the lead on planning and ensuring her preferences are considered. On the date, maintain a clean appearance and practice good manners, providing your full attention while refraining from discussing controversial topics.

Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom.

Write a summary based on this article: Mexican authorities said they hope the arrest of a former police chief who had been a fugitive for more than two years will help them solve one of the country’s most notorious human rights cases: the disappearance and presumed murder of 43 students. Felipe Flores Velazquez, 58, was arrested Friday without incident in Iguala, the town in Guerrero state where the students were last reported alive in September 2014. At the time, he was the police chief there. Renato Sales Heredia, head of the National Security Commission, said at a news conference Friday in Mexico City that Flores was detained after visiting his wife in Iguala. He is being held on suspicion of organized crime and kidnapping, Sales said. “The investigations indicate that this person was one of those responsible with coordinating the operation that turned into aggression against the students,” he said. In a Twitter message, Mexican Atty. Gen. Arely Gomez said the arrest and the prospect of testimony from the ex-chief should help “clarify the facts of Iguala.” Flores’ arrest adds to a growing roster of detentions in a case that has become an extreme embarrassment for the administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto. Officials say they have arrested 131 people in connection with the mass disappearance, mostly local police and suspected drug gang members. The former mayor of Iguala and his wife are also among those detained. Some detainees have alleged torture by Mexican authorities. Still, despite all the arrests, court cases, testimony and publicity surrounding the case, there is still no definitive answer as to what happened to the students on that evening. Many in Mexico fear that their precise fate will never be known. The students, from a teachers’ school in the rural town of Ayotzinapa, had hijacked several buses and were planning to join a protest. But they were detained by police in Iguala on the evening of Sept. 26, 2014. They have not been seen since. Not long after the students disappeared, so did the police chief. He was long seen as a key figure in piecing together what happened. Various theories have surfaced, some contradictory. Mexican authorities have said the students were picked up by police and handed over to a drug gang, which executed them and set their remains ablaze. But families of the students, forensic experts, an international investigative commission and others have questioned the official findings. The bodies have never been found. While the federal government has repeatedly denied any cover-up, the case has come to symbolize a corrupt system in which criminals and cops work hand in hand. Cooperation between local police and drug traffickers and other organized crime groups has been documented in Guerrero state and elsewhere in Mexico. patrick.mcdonnell@latimes.com Cecilia Sanchez in The Times’ Mexico City bureau contributed to this report.

This article was originally published at 2:30 p.m. ||||| (CNN) One of the \\"probable masterminds\\" of the disappearance of 43 Mexican students was arrested Friday morning after being on the lam for more than two years , according to Mexican officials. The announcement was made by Mexico's National Security Commission via Twitter. \\"(We) have executed the arrest warrant against Felipe Flores, former Iguala police chief,\\" the commission tweeted. The attorney general offered a reward of up to 2.5 million pesos (about 134,392 dollars) last year for any information that led to his capture. How the arrest happened Felipe Flores Velázquez was captured as he was visiting his spouse in Guerrero, the state where the students went missing in 2014, National Security Commissioner Renato Sales Heredia said at a news conference. Mexican federal authorities made the arrest in coordination with the attorney general's office, the country's navy and the Center of National Investigation and Security, an intelligence-gathering agency. No shots were fired. How did the students go missing? Authorities say he wanted to prevent the students from disrupting an event by his wife the night they went missing. The mayor then turned the students over to a gang who killed them, burned their bodies in a landfill and tossed some their remains into a nearby river, Karam added. Tomás Zerón de Lucio, the head of Mexico's Criminal Investigations Agency, said two months later that the incident was a case of mistaken identity. He said the criminal group accused of executing the students thought they belonged to a rival gang, also operating around the city of Iguala where the students were last seen. \\"We can conclude that the motivation was consistent (with the theory that) the students were identified by the criminals as members of an organized crime rival group that operated in the region. That was the reason why they were deprived of their freedom, initially, and then of their lives,\\" Zerón de Lucio said in early 2015. There is no indication that the mayor wanted all of the students dead , authorities said, but the gang mistook them for a rival group and executed them. What was the role of the former chief? Flores Vasquez helped protect city's police officers who were connected with the students' disappearance, authorities said. He also colluded with the city's mayor to persecute and attack the students and ordered local police to stop them from attending the protest. The former chief is being charged with organized crime and kidnapping, officials said Friday. Some 130 others have been arrested in connection with the case, Sales Heredia, added. |||||","completion":"The former chief of police in Iguala, Felipe Flores Velazquez, has been arrested in connection with the notorious disappearance and presumed murder of 43 students in the Mexican town in 2014.

The Dolphins' punted again on their next drive, and the Patriots opened up a 21-point lead with a 59-yard Maroney touchdown run while also setting the franchise record for net yards on a season, breaking the record of 5,965 set in 1978. After the Dolphins' fourth three-and-out of the game, a 38-yard Brandon Fields punt was muffed by Troy Brown and recovered by the Dolphins, who punted again three plays later. After moving the ball from their own 20-yard line to the Dolphins' 48-yard line, Brady completed a 48-yard touchdown pass to Gaffney on the Patriots' 71st touchdown of the season, breaking the NFL record of 70 set by the 1984 Dolphins. The Dolphins drove the Patriots' 4-yard line with 21&#160;seconds remaining in the half, but Tedy Bruschi batted down a Lemon pass on fourth down intended for Justin Peelle to preserve the Patriots' 28-0 lead heading into halftime. On the opening drive of the second half, Welker caught his 101st pass of the season, tying the Patriots individual franchise record Brown set in 2001. On the next play, Brady was intercepted by Jason Allen the end zone on a pass intended for Moss. After a 22-yard Chatman rush began the Dolphins' ensuing drive, the Dolphins punted for the seventh time three plays later. On third down from their own 28-yard line, Brady threw his second interception of the game, this time picked off by linebacker Derrick Pope on a pass also intended for Moss. The Dolphins moved the ball on their next drive from their own 46-yard line to the Patriots' 1-yard line, where Lemon scrambled out of bounds short of the end zone on 4th and goal. The Dolphins challenged the ruling, which was upheld after review. The play gave the Patriots the ball from their own 1-yard line, where a three-and-out set up a 64-yard Hanson punt from the end zone, his longest of the season. A 22-yard Lorenzo Booker rush on the Dolphins' next possession helped bring the Dolphins' to the Patriots 21-yard line, where Lemon connected with Greg Camarillo to cut the Patriots lead to 28-7. The Patriots committed their fourth turnover of the game when Brady was strip-sacked by Joey Porter to give the Dolphins the ball at their own 28-yard line. Four punts and a scoreless fourth quarter later, the Patriots picked up their 15th win of the season as they improved to 15-0 and became the first 15-0 team in NFL history. The Patriots' 15th win matched the win totals of the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, 1998 Minnesota Vikings, 1985 Chicago Bears, and 1984 San Francisco 49ers, while their 15-0 regular season start was a first in NFL history. The Patriots' 6-0 record against division opponents was a franchise first. The win also marked the Patriots' 18th straight regular season victory since their December 2006 loss to the Dolphins, tying the Patriots' 2003-2004 NFL record.

The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job?

Premise: Woman by building in short coat with other building in view. Hypothesis: The woman is naked. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the provided premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is accurate. The premise states that a woman is standing by a building, wearing a short coat, with another building in view. This premise offers limited information about the woman's attire and the surrounding environment. The key elements of the premise are: 1. Woman standing by a building - This statement informs us that there is a female individual next to some sort of architectural structure. 2. Wearing a short coat - The woman is wearing a coat that is presumably not covering her entire body. However, it is important to notice that the premise states she is wearing a short coat, which implies that there is some clothing on her. 3. Another building in view - There is a secondary building visible in the background, which provides context for the location, but not specifically the woman's attire. Now, let us examine the given hypothesis: The woman is naked. For this hypothesis to be valid, the woman in the given scenario would have to be nude or not wearing any clothing. However, the premise does indicate that the woman is wearing a short coat. While it is not clear what other garments she may or may not be wearing beneath the coat, the fact that she is clothed to some extent contradicts the hypothesis that she is naked. We can infer that the woman isn't completely naked, as she is wearing a short coat. To conclude that the woman is naked with the given information is both a leap in logic and an assumption based on insufficient details. The ambiguity of the given premise does not allow us to conclude that the woman is naked. A more detailed description of her attire or additional contextual information might help in determining the accuracy or inaccuracy of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose wife is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India? In an American suburb in Northern New Jersey, conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating Diwali in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a \\"Ditchable Dude\\". In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \\"What women want\\" from a man – evidently it is for them to \\"listen, listen, listen\\".

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"EDM, or Electronic Dance Music, is a broad term encompassing a wide range of electronic music genres characterized by their ability to engage and excite listeners for dance events, parties, and clubs. Primarily intended to be performed and enjoyed live, EDM has captured the imaginations of both music producers and listeners worldwide. Key elements of this music typically include repetitive, synthesized beats, bass-heavy rhythms, and catchy melodic hooks. The origins of modern EDM can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when disco, funk, and soul music began to influence a new generation of artists experimenting with synthesizers and electronic equipment. As these artists pushed the boundaries of what was possible with technology, new and distinct musical genres began to emerge. Over the past few decades, EDM has evolved into several sub-genres including house, techno, trance, dubstep, drum and bass, and many others. EDM often features prominent DJs and music producers who use digital tools and sound equipment to mix, blend, and create unique tracks. A DJ's role in the dance music scene might involve live performances, creating original compositions, or remixing existing works. EDM producers might also collaborate with vocalists, musicians, or other creative individuals to craft catchy and memorable tunes. The global appeal of EDM has grown exponentially in recent years. Several large-scale music festivals like Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival, and Electric Daisy Carnival cater exclusively to fans of EDM, drawing tens of thousands of attendees annually. Additionally, EDM has enjoyed commercial success, with many artists frequently topping music charts and earning prestigious awards.

Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song \\"Young Love,\\" which was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. He had the hit, \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter. Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, Lafayette Escadrille (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, Gunman's Walk (1958), a film that Hunter considers his favorite role. Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film Damn Yankees, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.'s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word.

Input: Context_1 : In mathematics, specifically in local class field theory, the Hasse–Arf theorem is a result concerning jumps of the upper numbering filtration of the Galois group of a finite Galois extension. A special case of it when the residue fields are finite was originally proved by Helmut Hasse, and the general result was proved by Cahit Arf. Context_2 : Cahit Arf (] ; 11 October 1910 – 26 December 1997) was a Turkish mathematician. He is known for the Arf invariant of a quadratic form in characteristic 2 (applied in knot theory and surgery theory) in topology, the Hasse–Arf theorem in ramification theory, Arf semigroups, and Arf rings. Context_3 : Yahya ibn Umar ibn Yahya ibn Husayn ibn Zayd ibn Ali Zayn al-Abidin ibn Al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Murtada was an Alid Imam. His mother was Umm al-Husayn Fatimah bint al-Husayn ibn Abdallah ibn Ismail ibn Abdullah ibn Ja\`far ibn Abī Tālib. In the days of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta'in, he marched out from Kufa and lead an abortive uprising from Kufa in 250 A.H. (864-65 C.E.), but was killed by the Abbasid forces led by Hussain ibn Isma’il, who had been sent to deal with him. Context_4 : Habīb ibn Madhāhir al-Asadi (Arabic: حبيب بن مظاهر الأسدي‎ ‎ ) was of the Banu Asad clan, and one of the companions of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. He was one of the people of Kufa who sent letters to Husayn ibn Ali (grandson of Muhammad) and invited him to Kufa. Though, when he realized that people of Kufa have broken their allegiance to Husayn, he left Kufa, joined Husayn, and was martyred at the age of 75 while fighting in Husayn's army, in Karbala. Context_5 : Bibi Pāk Dāman (Urdu: بی بی پاکدامن) is the mausoleum of Ruqayyah bint Ali located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Legend has it that it holds the graves of six ladies from Muhammad's household (Ahl Al-Bayt). Ruqayyah bint Ali ibn Abu Talib was the daughter of Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abu Talib with his wife Umm al banin bint Huzaam. Ruqayah bint Ali was the full sister of Al-Abbas ibn Ali and also the wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel (emissary of third Shi'a Imam Husayn ibn Ali to Kufah). Others are said to be Muslim ibn Aqil's sister and daughters. It is said that these ladies came here after the event of the battle of Karbala on the 10th day of the month of Muharram in 61 AH (October 10, AD 680). Bibi Pak Daman, which means the \\"chaste lady\\", is the collective name of the six ladies believed to interred at this mausoleum, though it is also (mistakenly) popularly used to refer to the personage of Ruqayyah bint Ali alone. They were among the women who brought Islam to South Asia, preaching and engaging in missionary activity in the environs of Lahore. It is said that Data Ganj Bakhsh, considered a great Sufi saint of the South Asia, was himself a devotee of the Bibi Pak Daman shrine and received holy knowledge from this auspicious shrine. Context_6 : Abbas (Abbass, Arabic: عباس‎ ‎ means \\"lion\\" in Arabic The name traces back to Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib (an uncle of Muhammad) and Abbas ibn Ali, a son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, who participated in the battle of Karbala alongside his half-brother Hussain ibn Ali. Abbas ibn Ali is revered by Shia Muslims, some of whom are named Abbas in remembrance and tribute to him. There is an Arabian tribe of the same name, the Banu Abbas. In Arabic language it literally means \\"grouchy face\\" or \\"frown\\" referring to a Mean-spirited or a Stern person mainly male. Context_7 : People with the surname Zaidi trace their origins to the Islamic Holy City of Mecca, located in present-day Saudi Arabia. Descendants of Zaid ibn Ali are known as Sayyid, an honorific title bestowed upon to the descendants of Muhammad. The Zaidi surname is derived from Zaid ibn Ali, the son of Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abidin, who was the great grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. Descendants of Zaid ibn Ali who chose to move away from the Arabian Peninsula and have the surname Zaidi are commonly located in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Context_8 : This is a simplified family tree of Husayn ibn Ali. For the ancestors of ibn Ali see the family tree of Muhammad and the family tree of Ali. People in \\"italics\\" are considered by the majority of Shia and Sunni Muslims to be \\"Ahl al-Bayt\\" (\\"People of the House\\"). Twelver Shia also see the 4th to 12th Imamah as Ahl al-Bayt. \\"(Ali is an imam in Mustaali but no number is assigned for this position, and Hasan ibn Ali is not an imam in Nizari Imamah.)\\" Context_9 : In the mathematical field of knot theory, the Arf invariant of a knot, named after Cahit Arf, is a knot invariant obtained from a quadratic form associated to a Seifert surface. If \\"F\\" is a Seifert surface of a knot, then the homology group H(\\"F\\", Z/2Z) has a quadratic form whose value is the number of full twists mod 2 in a neighborhood of an imbedded circle representing an element of the homology group. The Arf invariant of this quadratic form is the Arf invariant of the knot. Context_10 : He is known to have translated and modified the Zij al-Sindhind. The Zij al-Sindhind was the first astronomical table ever introduced in the Muslim World. As a mathematician Sind ibn ʿAlī was a colleague of al-Khwarizmi and worked closely with Yaqūb ibn Tāriq together they calculated the diameter of the Earth and other astronomical bodies. He also wrote a commentary on \\"Kitāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala\\" and helped prove the works of al-Khwarizmi.

Q:Given the below context: The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

He thus attains bodhi and becomes a buddha. In Theravada Buddhism, bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning as in the early texts, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The bodhisattva is not full of hallucination. In the context provided, it is stated that the bodhisattva achieves not only nirvana, but also full liberation from delusion in Mahayana Buddhism. This means that a bodhisattva attains a state of complete enlightenment and freedom from the influence of greed, hate, and delusion, making them the very opposite of being full of hallucination. In contrast, the arahant has attained only nirvana, which leaves them still subject to some level of delusion."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What area in the area that is used for hiking, hunting, and fishing was reopened for fishing in 1959?, using the article: According to the DCNR, Quehanna Wild Area is for the public \\"to see, use and enjoy for such activities as hiking, hunting, and fishing\\". The main hiking trail on the Quehanna plateau is the Quehanna Trail, a 75-mile (121 km) loop trail that passes through the wild area and Moshannon and Elk State Forests. The main trailhead for most hikers is at Parker Dam State Park to the west of the wild area. From there the trail, which is blazed in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the loop back at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its 9,700 feet (2,957 m) of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add 30 miles (48 km) to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail \\"passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer\\".Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams reports that before Curtiss-Wright took over the area in 1955, Quehanna was considered \\"some of the best hunting land in the state\\". No hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, but by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, cottontail rabbit, coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Swaddling is believed to create a tight, warm environment similar to the womb. Even snugly wrapping your little tyke in a blanket and holding them close to your chest should help quickly calm them down. Get them warm and snug and start rocking. You can lay the baby on their side after swaddling. It better mimics the feeling of the womb and calms them faster. Just be sure to maintain constant supervision if you place the baby on their side. A pacifier or your finger is perfect. Sucking actually steadies a baby's heart rate, relaxes their stomach, and calms flailing limbs. This might be the ticket to a quiet, contented infant. If your baby is crying while struggling to fall asleep, you can remind them that you’re there with gentle touch. Lightly pat the baby’s back or rub gentle circles between their shoulder blades. You could even hold their tiny hand in your own. Any of these option can help soothe a baby enough to stop crying. Walk at a slow steady speed. Babies love rhythmic motion, and the lack of light will slowly make them sleepy. If you can, go outdoors—the change to fresh air may help them calm down. Gentle, calming movements are all that matters. Babies love to be touched, so slow, consistent massaging might slow them down and quiet their lungs. Play some peek-a-boo. Lie them on their back and rotate their feet like they were riding a bike. Make silly faces and talk to the child. Just being a distracting, stimulating influence may be enough to get them to stop crying. Babies need to be entertained, so entertain them! If you're out of options, it is time to look for help.

There is no reason to fear anything—but you should verify your specific situation with a professional. If the crying is high-pitched, random, and the baby seems tense, they may have colic, a crying disorder. Luckily, colic tends to go away by the time your baby is 12-14 weeks old. Note when a baby cries to find patterns—right before a nap, after waking up, after eating certain foods, etc. Pay attention to your baby's signals to prevent future outbursts. Baby's crying usually peaks around 6 weeks, but it eases off afterward.","completion":"Swaddling is like wrapping your baby in a cozy blanket to make them feel safe, warm, and calm like they are in mommy's belly.

Frank offered to accompany the children , because he wanted to see Aslan himself . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Paraphrasing is the act of restating or rewording a statement or passage to express the same meaning using different words. In both sentences, the essential meaning is the same: Frank wishes to accompany the children to see Aslan personally. Although there are slight variations in the wording and sentence structure, the overall meaning remains unchanged. The first sentence uses \\"proposed\\" while the second sentence uses \\"offered,\\" and the word order is subtly altered between the sentences. However, these differences do not change the main idea being conveyed. Here's a more detailed look at the two sentences: 1. Frank proposed to accompany the children because he wanted to see Aslan himself. - \\"proposed\\" suggests that Frank put forward an idea or plan - \\"accompany the children\\" indicates that Frank wants to go with the children - \\"because he wanted to see Aslan himself\\" explains the reason behind Frank's proposal, which is his own desire to see Aslan 2. Frank offered to accompany the children, because he wanted to see Aslan himself. - \\"offered\\" suggests that Frank is volunteering or willingly suggesting going with the children - \\"accompany the children\\" again shows that Frank wants to be with the children for this activity - \\"because he wanted to see Aslan himself\\" remains consistent in expressing Frank's underlying motivation to see Aslan In summary, despite the minor differences in word choice and structure, both sentences convey the same meaning and can be considered paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - atom - molecules - protons - nucleus A: A:","completion":"The single circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus. Instead, it occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell. To provide more detail, bacterial cells lack the membrane-bound organelles typically found in eukaryotic cells, such as the nucleus. Bacterial DNA is not surrounded by a nuclear envelope, which is characteristic of the enclosed DNA chromosomes in eukaryotes. In a bacterial cell, the nucleoid is a region in the cytoplasm where the single, circular DNA chromosome can be found. The nucleoid is not a membrane-bound structure. Instead, it is a dense, irregularly shaped area within the cell where the DNA chromosome, as well as various proteins associated with its organization and maintenance, are found. The bacterial chromosome typically consists of a single, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule. This DNA is organized into a compact structure known as a supercoiled DNA, which allows the chromosome to fit within the small bacterial cell. Various proteins play a vital role in maintaining this supercoiled organization, including DNA gyrase and topoisomerase. Unlike eukaryotic cells, bacteria do not possess histone proteins that aid in the packaging of DNA. However, they do have histone-like proteins called nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) that help condense, fold, and organize the DNA within the nucleoid region. These NAPs aid in various processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, and recombination, that are essential for the bacteria to function and grow properly. In addition to the nucleoid, bacterial cells contain other essential components, such as ribosomes and plasmids. Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, whereas plasmids are small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules that exist independently of the bacterial chromosome and can carry genes that provide the bacteria with advantageous traits. In summary, the single circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead, it exists within a nucleoid region in the bacterial cell. The nucleoid is a dense area in the cytoplasm where the DNA chromosome and various associated proteins can be found, allowing the bacteria to carry out the necessary processes for growth and survival."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

We have a premise, which is like a clue, and a hypothesis, which is like a guess we're trying to prove. Our clue says that Jones-Lee and Krupnick might not be showing the full picture of age because they only think about the money people earn (income) and not the money people have saved up (wealth). Our guess is that both the money people earn (income) and the money people save (wealth) are important when talking about age. Now, we want to know if our guess is right when our clue is true. If our clue tells us that not considering wealth might not show the full picture of age, then it implies that wealth must be important too, just like our guess says.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a struggling actor who has lost his role as a vampire in a low-budget horror movie after his claustrophobia thwarts shooting. After returning home to discover his girlfriend cheating on him, he is left without a place to stay. At a method acting class he meets Sam (Gregg Henry) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's friend has left town temporarily and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the Hollywood Hills. During the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially ecstatic about one feature: a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle (Deborah Shelton), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Sam has even set up a telescope which Scully cannot resist using voyeuristically to watch her. One night he sees Gloria being abused by a boyfriend. When she goes shopping the next day, Scully decides to follow her. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \\"Indian,\\" a man he had noticed watching Gloria a few days prior.

Step-by-step breakdown: 1. Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant: The energy from sunlight is absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules in the plant, which is the driving force for photosynthesis. 2. The sunlight's energy is trapped: Chlorophyll molecules trap this energy, which initiates a series of chemical reactions within the plant cell. 3. The plant takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment: The plant absorbs water through its roots and carbon dioxide from the air through small pores on the leaves called stomata. 4. Glucose is formed: Using the energy from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, the plant undergoes a series of chemical reactions to produce glucose (a simple sugar) and oxygen. 5. The final step is the release of oxygen: As a byproduct of producing glucose, the plant releases oxygen gas (O2) into the atmosphere through the stomata, completing the process of photosynthesis.

VPC Grand jury verdict: A demonstrator wipes her eyes as she joins others to say a prayer in front of the police station in Ferguson on Nov. 24 after a St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson. (Photo: Jewel Samad, AFP/Getty Images) FERGUSON, Mo. -- A white police officer will not face charges for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager in a case that set off violent protests and racial unrest throughout the nation. CLOSE Protestors, angry over the grand jury decision not to indict Michael Brown, take to the streets in cities across the nation. A St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict officer Darren Wilson, 28, for firing six shots in an August confrontation that killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch said Monday night. Crowds of protesters filled streets near the Ferguson police station following the announcement. A police car and stores were set on fire, other stores were looted, gunfire was heard and bricks were hurled. Police said they had been fired on and responded with smoke bombs and pepper spray before using tear gas. Police later said they came under heavy automatic weapon fire, and some buildings were left to burn because of the danger. County police said an officer suffered a gunshot wound, but it was unclear if it was because of the protest violence. Protests sprang up in cities from New York to Los Angeles and remained mostly peaceful. At least half a dozen commercial airline flights into St. Louis were diverted out of concerns about the unrest. The Federal Aviation Administration at 11:15 p.m. ET said it had restricted flights into and out of Lambert International Airport in St. Louis to \\"provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.\\" The restriction lifts at 5:15 a.m. ET. The grand jury's decision had been long awaited and followed earlier Ferguson rioting that resembled war-zone news footage in this predominantly black suburb of St. Louis. PROTESTS: Demonstrators hit streets across nation FAMILY: Michael Brown's mom screams, sobs at decision In Washington, President Obama appeared before TV cameras. \\"We need to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make,'' he said in calling for peaceful protests. But Obama said the Ferguson case \\"speaks to broader challenges that we still face as a nation.'' Prosecutor McCulloch made the announcement in an unusual nighttime presentation in a courtroom. He spoke at length about media coverage of the case and what he called the unreliability of eyewitness accounts. He said the grand jury weighed evidence and testimony before concluding there was no probable cause to indict the officer. \\"The duty of the grand jury is to separate fact from fiction,'' McCulloch said. He said prosecuting attorneys presented five potential indictments to the grand jury, and all were rejected. \\"The jury was not inclined to indict on any charges,'' Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, said after being informed of the decision by authorities. In grand jury testimony released by prosecutors Monday night, Wilson, the officer, described the confrontation and said that Brown refused his instructions to stop walking in the street. He said Brown cursed him, then slammed the officer's car door shut as he was trying to exit his vehicle. He said Brown appeared to be trying \\"almost like to intimidate or overpower me.'' They scuffled and Brown hit the officer, Wilson testified. \\"When I grabbed him, the only way I can describe it is I felt like a five-year-old holding Hulk Hogan,'' Wilson said. He had no Taser weapon and felt his mace spray would not work, Wilson said: \\"So the only other option I thought I had was my gun.\\" He drew it, he said, and told Brown to \\"get back or I'm going to shoot you.\\" He said Brown grabbed the gun with his right hand and twisted it, pushing it down into Wilson's hip, before the officer fired. Brown's family attorneys received a call from McCulloch shortly before the announcement that there would be no charges against the officer. Crump took the call and and delivered the news to Brown's family in an area hotel. REACTION: Legal and advocacy groups sound off APOLOGY: Peter King sorry for 'indictment' tweet Lesley McSpadden, Brown's mother, cried and shouted when Crump told her there was no indictment and that the prosecutor was willilng to meet with the family. McSpadden began crying and shouting. Her body vibrated with pain as she jumped to her feet. \\"I do want to meet with him right now,\\" McSpadden screamed. \\"What do you mean no indictment?!\\" She then ran out of a hotel room followed by family members. Brown's family later released a statement saying, \\"We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions.'' They urged others who share their pain to \\"channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change.'' Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, called for calm after calling up National Guard troops to stand by in case of unrest. Speaking before the decision was announced, he urged that \\"regardless of the decision, people on all sides show tolerance, mutual respect and restraint.'' Crowds gathered around the Ferguson police headquarters in anticipation of the announcement at the courthouse in Clayton, Mo., another St. Louis suburb. The 12-person grand jury had been considering whether probable cause existed to bring charges against Wilson, 28, the white officer who fatally shot Brown, an 18-year-old black man, after their Aug. 9 confrontation. The shooting inflamed tensions in a largely minority community that is patrolled by an overwhelmingly white police force. Brown's lifeless and bleeding body lay for more than four hours in a Ferguson residential street after the shooting, prompting dismay and anger as a crowd gathered. Protests turned into rioting and looting the following night, and police responded with armored vehicles and tear gas, triggering a nationwide debate over police tactics. The grand jury, including nine whites and three African Americans, had been meeting in secret for months, hearing evidence and weighing whether Wilson's should face charges that could have ranged from involuntary manslaughter to murder. Brown's family joined thousands of protesters to demand Wilson's arrest in the weeks after the death of their son. As anger at official inaction grew following Brown's death, protesters clashed with police, who began patrolling the streets with military-grade weapons and armored vehicles. Wilson has been on paid leave and largely invisible since the shooting. While the grand jury met in secret to hear evidence in the case, two starkly different versions of the events leading to the shooting emerged in media accounts. Police have said a scuffle broke out after Wilson asked Brown and a friend to move out of the street. Wilson told investigators he shot Brown only after the teenager reached for the officer's gun. Some witnesses said Brown had run away from Wilson, then turned and raised his hands in the air in a gesture of surrender before he was shot in the head and chest. Paul Morris (center front) boards up his store in Ferguson on Nov. 24. (Photo: Nick Oza, USA TODAY) The unusual timing of the grand jury's announcement, after darkness had fallen, was a decision of prosecutors, Nixon said. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay acknowledged the case \\"has deeply divided us'' but said \\"turning violent or damaging property will not be tolerated.'' \\"The world will be watching us,'' Slay said. The death of Brown touched off weeks of protests, and the decision by the grand jury on whether to bring charges prompted extraordinary precautions by law enforcement and the community. The Ferguson school district canceled Tuesday classes. Police officers secure an area in front of the Buzz Westfall Justice Center in Clayton, Mo.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2001, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud. Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, warning about the coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob is a protÃ©gÃ© of managing director Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world. Jake is also financially assisting his mother (Susan Sarandon), who has begun a new career selling real estate. When the recession of 2008 hits, Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 50% of its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier. Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train because he cannot handle the stress and embarrassment of losing his company. A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts, then attends a lecture given by Gordon Gekko and introduces himself afterward. Gekko tells him that Keller Zabel's collapse started when rumors of the company having toxic debt started to spread. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton's career to seek revenge for Zabel's suicide. Jake, aided by Gekko, learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse. In revenge, Jake spreads rumors about the nationalization of an Equatorial Guinea oil field...

This makes our eyes look bigger and more sparkly! There are lots of colors to choose from, but most people like black or brown because it matches their eyelashes. 3. Apply Mascara: Have you ever seen a paintbrush? Mascara is like a little paintbrush for our eyelashes!

As the frosty chill of winter settled in the air, Jessica noticed that her friend Katrina was shivering, her hands visibly trembling, and her fingers turning an icy shade of blue. Jessica, well-prepared for the winter weather, had brought along a pair of gloves. As much as she would have liked to keep them for herself, she realized that her friend was in dire need of some warmth and comfort. Upon noticing Katrina's discomfort, Jessica's empathy and care for her friend prompted her to take decisive action. So, without a second thought, she removed her gloves, revealing her own hands. Though Jessica had been wearing the gloves to keep her hands warm, she understood that Katrina's need was far greater than hers at that moment. Handing the gloves over to Katrina, Jessica watched as her friend's face lit up with gratitude and relief. Slipping the gloves onto her frostbitten hands, Katrina began to feel the warmth seeping back into her fingers. The gloves were well-insulated, designed to retain heat and shield the hands from the cold winds and harsh elements of winter. As the two friends continued their journey, Katrina's hands began to regain their natural color and dexterity. The act of kindness displayed by Jessica not only provided her friend with the warmth she so desperately needed but also served to strengthen their friendship further. It reminded them both that sometimes, even the smallest acts can make a significant difference in the lives of the people around us. Though option I would suggest that Jessica initially took off the gloves because her hands were cold, it would not make much sense for her to give the gloves to Katrina under that circumstance. Instead, Jessica's altruistic act was motivated by her desire to provide comfort to her friend, making option II the more fitting choice to complete the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: By of the Six fake Democratic candidates put up by the Republican Party to buy time for Republican state senators subject to recalls accomplished that job Tuesday, but none of them did the unexpected and knocked off a real Democrat. Candidates backed by the Democratic Party won all six Senate primary elections, all but one of them by substantial amounts. They'll all go on to face the Republican incumbents on Aug. 9, in an attempt by Democrats to regain control of the state Senate and put the brakes on Gov. Scott Walker's agenda. That the primaries were held at all is a function of the twists and turns of political strategy played out in recent months as the state broke into warring camps over Walker's attempt to restrict collective bargaining for public employees. The Republican Party forced the primaries to give its six senators facing recall another four weeks before facing a Democratic challenger, in order to allow them to take their case to the voters and argue that their work on the budget was good for the state. The winners Tuesday: Former Brown County Executive Nancy Nusbaum of De Pere defeated Otto Junkermann of Allouez, a one-time Republican state representative and past supporter of Sen. Rob Cowles (R-Allouez). Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Whitefish Bay) easily defeated Gladys Huber, a Republican Party stalwart from Mequon. Pasch will face Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills). Shelly Moore, a teacher and official in the state teachers union from River Falls, defeated Isaac Weix of Menomonie, a hardware store owner and former failed candidate in Republican Party primaries for state Assembly. She'll face Sen. Sheila Harsdorf (R-River Falls) in the general election. Weix did the best of all the Republican-backed candidates. Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo) defeated Republican Rol Church of Wautoma for the right to face Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon). Jessica King, former deputy mayor of Oshkosh, defeated John Buckstaff of Oshkosh for the right to face Sen. Randy Hopper (R-Fond du Lac). Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) defeated James D. Smith, a hospital technician in La Crosse, for the right to face Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse). State Republican Party officials maintained in the weeks leading up to the primaries that their only purpose in mounting the protest Democrats was to buy time for their candidates. But there was some activity in the final week to turn out voters for those candidates. One of the most prominent efforts was in Harsdorf's 10th Senate District, where Jesse Garza, chairman of the St. Croix County Republican Party, sent out an email urging recipients to vote Tuesday, telling them a vote for Weix was the same as a vote for Harsdorf. Moore was probably the Democrat most vulnerable to this tactic, as she didn't have the name recognition the other Democrats did - all of them having run for or held a major office in their districts. Calls urging votes for the fake Democrats were reported in three other Senate districts last week - Olsen's, Hopper's and Kapanke's - with a piece of literature sent out in Hopper's. It said voting for protest Democrat Buckstaff over King was a way to express support for Walker. The primaries set up major faceoffs in the six districts, with national attention on the races, and massive amounts of money and national advertising flowing into the state. The recalls against the Republicans were launched last March over their backing of Walker's collective bargaining measure. Democrats call the move an attack on the middle class. Republicans say it was necessary to balance the state's budget, which they accomplished last month. Political heat will rise With the final election less than a month away, the heat of that debate is likely to pick up fast. Already the conservative Club for Growth and a liberal coalition called We Are Wisconsin, supported by contributions from national unions, are active in the state. The conservative Americans for Prosperity, which has been connected with the national tea party movement, is operating a phone bank in Kenosha County this week. In addition to the outside money, both Democratic challengers and Republican incumbents have substantial campaign war chests of their own - with the most money likely to be spent in Darling's Milwaukee-area district. Darling and Pasch have raised nearly 1.4 million between them, with Darling collecting the lion's share, some 958,000. There's also what politicians call a strong ground game in operation in many of the districts - plenty of people out knocking on doors. David Kreisman, Pasch's campaign manager, said campaign representatives have knocked on 20,000 doors in the Senate district since last Friday. We Are Wisconsin is also out in the district. In a statement after her victory, Pasch said, \\"I am proud that the people of the 8th state Senate District have stood up to the cynical ploys of my opponents. \\"I look forward to holding honest, insightful debates on the issues with Senator Darling in this summer's recall election.\\" Conventional wisdom is that Kapanke, who serves an increasingly blue district, and Hopper, whose marital problems have received a wide airing, are the Republicans most vulnerable to being ousted by their Democratic rivals, and that Darling and Cowles are the least likely to fall. Darling has said she takes the recall election very seriously, and a statement from her Tuesday night says she's proud of her record of balancing the budget without raising taxes. The recall elections of the six Republicans are just part of the state's unprecedented recall picture. Democrats facing recalls Three Democratic state senators also face recall elections, with the first of that voting to start next week. The recalls of the Democrats were launched in February, after 14 Democratic senators fled the state for three weeks to delay a vote on the collective bargaining measure. Their opponents fault them for leaving their jobs and shirking their duties. Elections in the recalls of the Democrats are July 19. Two of those races will be Republican primaries; the third, between Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay) and Republican challenger David VanderLeest of Green Bay, is a general election. The other two general elections will be Aug. 16. All of the recall winners will have to run again in November 2012, at least some of them in districts changed by redistricting. Meg Jones and Larry Sandler of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report. ||||| All six Wisconsin Democrats won their recall primaries today, easily fending off challenges from “protest” candidates put forward by Republicans to delay the general elections. All six official Democrats have been projected as winners by the Associated Press. Only one race was at all close, the one between schoolteacher Shelly Moore (D) and 2010 Republican Assembly candidate Issac Weix in the primary to take on Sen. Sheila Harsdorf. Every other Democrat is projected to win by double-digits. After recall elections were triggered against six Republican state senators over the state’s contentious collective bargaining law, Republicans launched “protest” candidates in each primary to give their incumbents more time to campaign. The general elections were pushed back from today to Aug. 9. “The voters of Wisconsin have rejected the Republicans’ dirty tricks, despite their best efforts to turn out voters in these primaries for fake candidates,” said Democratic Party spokeswoman Gillian Morris. In the race to take on Sen. Robert Cowles, former Brown County executive Nancy Nusbaum defeated retired GOP assemblyman Otto Junkerman. In the race to take on Sen. Alberta Darling, state Rep. Sandy Pasch (D) defeated Gladys Huber. In the race to take on Sen. Dan Kapanke, state Rep. Jennifer Schilling defeated young Republican activist James Smith. In the race to take on Sen. Randy Hopper, Deputy Oshkosh Mayor Jessica King (D) defeated retiree John Buckstaff. In the race to take on Sen. Luther Olsen, state Rep. Fred Clark (D) defeated Rollin Church. Several Republican candidates and local parties were at least hoping for an upset. Wisconsin has open primaries, so it was possible for Republicans to vote for the “protest” candidates in these races. But the state GOP maintained from the outset of the recalls that the only purpose of the “protest” challenges was to delay — not prevent — a race. “Now that self-proclaimed fiscal conservatives have set 500,000 of taxpayer money on fire in fake primaries that served no purpose beyond their ‘do-anything’ quest to maintain power, voters will have a chance to put the brakes on Scott Walker and his extreme agenda in legitimate elections on August 9th,” said Kelly Steele, a spokesman for the pro-union PAC We Are Wisconsin, in a statement. Three Democratic state senators also face recalls this summer. Next Tuesday is the general election against state Sen. Dave Hansen (D) and Republican primaries to take on Democratic state Sens. Robert Wirch and Dave Hansen. If Democrats net three wins, they will take back the state Senate. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In recent recall elections, six Republican-backed faux Democratic candidates were defeated by officially endorsed Democratic contenders. The \\"protest\\" candidates were initially put forth as a strategic measure by the Republican party to buy time for the incumbent Republican state senators facing recall to engage with their constituents and argue their case. The winners were former Brown County Executive Nancy Nusbaum, Rep. Sandy Pasch, teacher and union official Shelly Moore, Rep. Fred Clark, former deputy mayor Jessica King, and Rep. Jennifer Shilling. These winners will face Republican incumbents on August 9 as Democrats aim to regain control of the state Senate and challenge Gov. Scott Walker's agenda. The state is currently divided due to Walker's attempts to limit collective bargaining for public employees, a move causing massive amounts of money and national attention to flow into Wisconsin's political scene. In addition to the six targeted Republicans, three Democratic state senators are facing recall elections, with voting starting next week. The winners of these recall elections will have to run again in November 2022, possibly in redistricted areas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Didn't learn much Review: I bought this book because I thought that building a single application throughout the book would be a good way to learn Java. Unfortunately, this did not happen. The author generally presents a code listing and then explains what it does. That's nice, but I would have liked to have some end-of-chapter exercises so that I could have applied what was covered in the chapter. There were also some omissions in the code starting in Chapter 8, which kept the class from being able to compile correctly.While this book may appeal to those that can pick up the nuances of a programming language by just reading code, those of us who learn by doing would be better off looking elsewhere.

We have: -6123 * h = -4489 * h - 4902 We can think about it like: h multiplied by -6123 must be equal to h multiplied by -4489 minus 4902. To find out the value of h, we first need to get all the parts with h on the same side. So, let's move the -4489 * h to the left. We'll do that by adding 4489 * h (the opposite) to both sides: -6123 * h + 4489 * h = -4902 Now, let's see how many h's we have on the left: (-6123 + 4489) * h = -4902 Which is: -1634 * h = -4902 Next, we need to find the value of h. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -1634: h = -4902 / -1634 When you divide two negative numbers, you get a positive number: h = 3 So there you go! The value of h is 3!

On the positive side, the reviewer gives credit to the bean dip and the queso fundido, highlighting that these items were enjoyable, indicating a positive sentiment in this regard. They express appreciation for these specific dishes and even award two 'stars' for them, which typically conveys approval and satisfaction. However, the majority of the comments lean towards the negative side of the sentiment spectrum. The reviewer conveys dissatisfaction with the price point, suggesting they believe the food is overpriced for the quality and authenticity offered. They also criticize the chilaquiles, a specific dish, labeling it as terrible. Furthermore, the staff are described as not entirely present or attentive, indicating an unsatisfactory service experience. Additionally, the reviewer declares they have never been a fan of the Lindo chains and states that they are consistently disappointed by them. These comments collectively represent a negative sentiment. Also, the use of words like \\"ridiculously high\\", \\"terrible\\", \\"fail\\", \\"disappoint\\" denotes strong negative sentiment towards their experience at this establishment. So, while there are aspects they enjoyed, the negative comments outweigh the positive ones, painting a mixed but overall more negative picture of their sentiment towards the restaurant. The major emphasis of the review lies in the criticism, therefore one might conclude that the overall sentiment of the review tends towards negativity. Yet, the mention of some positive elements does not allow us to classify the review as entirely negative, hence the mixed sentiment classification. It would be significant for the management of this restaurant to consider both the praised and the criticized elements to improve the overall dining experience and potentially shift the sentiment of such reviews in a more positive direction in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Say this using Spanish","completion":"El altar del corazón se llama así, no solo como un símbolo, sino también porque al colocar un pensamiento en el corazón, uno puede sentir una presión aparentemente ligera en la parte superior del corazón. El término \\"altar del corazón\\" representa una idea muy profunda y espiritual en relación con la forma en que las personas experimentan y conectan con sus emociones internas. Se emplea como una metáfora para describir la importancia del corazón como un símbolo de amor, comprensión y devoción en nuestras vidas. En este sentido, se puede decir que se llama \\"altar del corazón\\" no sólo porque funciona como una representación simbólica en el ámbito emocional y espiritual, sino también por la experiencia física y sensorial que puede llegar a sentir una persona al tener pensamientos que influyen de manera notable en su estado emocional y espiritual. Al enfocar la mente en emociones o pensamientos específicos y poderosos, estos pueden manifestarse físicamente a través de ciertas sensaciones en el cuerpo, incluida esa ligera presión en la parte superior del corazón. Cabe destacar que este tipo de experiencias pueden variar dependiendo de cada individuo y de cómo cada uno se conecta con su propio ser y emociones. No obstante, la idea del \\"altar del corazón\\" sigue siendo un concepto importante en el ámbito del crecimiento personal y la búsqueda de bienestar emocional. A través de la meditación, la introspección y la conexión con nuestras emociones más profundas, podemos descubrir y fortalecer el vínculo con nuestro propio altar del corazón y mejorar nuestra calidad de vida.

DVD has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit, the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like The Border. There were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co-written by The Wild Bunch's Walon Green, Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast (Harvey Keitel, Warren Oates, Valerie Perrine), Tony Richardson directing (although he was pretty much a spent force by then)  but now it doesn't even turn up on TV. The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption, with Nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism, until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. Unfortunately, he never really gets his hands dirty, barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and, sadly, the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original, nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers. While that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low-key Nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film, it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint, then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him, one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level. The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease (and one impressive car stunt) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. Unfortunately Ry Cooder's beautiful title song, Across the Borderline, says it all much more economically. But if you want to know the film's real crime, it's completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part. When even he can't make an impression, you know something's really wrong.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who is jailed? is inside the article: Kelly is a prostitute who shows up in the small town of Grantville, just one more burg in a long string of quick stops on the run after being chased out of the big city by her former pimp. She engages in a quick tryst with local police captain Griff, who then tells her to stay out of his town and refers her to a cat-house just across the state line. Instead, she decides to give up her illicit lifestyle, becoming a nurse at a hospital for handicapped children. Griff doesn't trust reformed prostitutes, however, and continues trying to run her out of town. Kelly falls in love with J.L. Grant, the wealthy scion of the town's founding family, an urbane sophisticate, and Griff's best friend. After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry. It is only after Kelly is able to finally convince Griff that she truly loves Grant and has given up prostitution for good that he agrees to be their best man. Shortly before the wedding, Kelly arrives at Grant's mansion, only to find him on the verge of molesting a small girl. As he grinningly tries to persuade her to marry him, arguing that she too is a deviant, the only one who can understand him, and that he loves her, Kelly kills him by striking him in the head with a phone receiver. Jailed, and under heavy interrogation from Griff, she must convince him and the town that she is telling the truth about Grant's death. As Kelly tries to exonerate herself, one disappointment follows another, and enemies old and new parade through the jailhouse to defame her.

Instead, their primary goal is to help people, and they consider this to be a neat or valuable endeavor. On the other hand, the second sentence explicitly states that the speaker promotes something to gain recognition. This directly contradicts the intention expressed in the first sentence. Hence, it is clear that the second sentence is not entailed by the first one. An entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. In this case, the two sentences convey different intentions and objectives, which makes it difficult to establish any entailment between them.

Thomas Lawton was born on 6 October 1919 to Elizabeth Riley and Thomas Lawton senior in Farnworth, Lancashire. His father was a railway signalman of Irish extraction, and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill. His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born, and Elizabeth moved back into her parents' home in Bolton. Elizabeth's father, James Hugh \\"Jim\\" Riley, became Lawton's surrogate father. Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves against Manchester City Reserves in September 1935, and though he struggled in this game he went on to become a regular Reserve team player by the age of 16. After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his \\"keen and fearless\\" performance by the Express & News newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3-1 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance which caused him to miss two fixtures, before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935-36 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games. Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936, and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League. He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh. He scored 369 runs in 15 completed innings for an average of 24.06. He turned professional at Burnley at the age of 17 on wages of PS7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a PS500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league's maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds, before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head. When did Tommy play for Burnley?","completion":"Tommy Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves in September 1935.

Here are possible answers to this question: - dry mouth - whispering - being heard - eye contact - not listening I believe the correct choice is \\"not listening\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Talking to someone is indeed pointless if they're not listening. Here's why: Communication is a two-way process that involves the exchange of messages between two or more parties and requires both speaking and listening to be effective. When someone is not listening, they are not engaged in the conversation, and mutual understanding becomes difficult or impossible to achieve. Here's a brief analysis of the other options provided: - Dry mouth: While someone with a dry mouth may have difficulty speaking clearly, it does not inherently make communication pointless. The person can still listen and comprehend the other party's message. - Whispering: Although whispering might make it harder to hear the conversation, it doesn't make the exchange pointless. Whispering could be interpreted as a sign of being secretive or discreet, but it doesn't necessarily imply that the person is not engaged in the conversation. - Being heard: This option might create an ambiguous statement. If a person is being heard, it implies that they are talking and someone is listening, making the conversation meaningful. Conversely, if a person cannot be heard, it may hinder effective communication, but it doesn't imply that the person is not listening. - Eye contact: While maintaining eye contact is an essential aspect of non-verbal communication, it does not solely dictate the effectiveness of a conversation. A lack of eye contact may suggest disinterest or distractions, but it doesn't always mean that the individual is not listening to the conversation. In conclusion, out of the given options, \\"not listening\\" is the correct choice because it directly affects the communication process and renders the conversation futile.

Answer the following question: Addison is very in touch with their emotions and feelings. Given the context: How would you describe Addison? Possible answers: confident emotionally, an arrogant person, a self aware person Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context which tells us that \\"Addison is very in touch with their emotions and feelings,\\" I would describe Addison as a self-aware person. Step 1: Identify the key information from the context The context emphasizes that Addison is in touch with emotions and feelings. This suggests an awareness and understanding of their own emotional state. Step 2: Compare each possible answer to the context A self-aware person is someone who has a clear understanding of their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. This trait aligns with the key information that Addison understands their emotions and feelings well. 'Confident emotionally' could fit the description too, but it isn't the best answer; because it is focused more on the emotional state rather than the awareness itself. Confidence is not explicitly mentioned in the context. 'An arrogant person' doesn't align with the context. Arrogance is a form of self-importance and overestimation of one's abilities. It doesn't describe someone who is in touch with their emotions and feelings. Step 3: Choose the best fitting answer Based on the context and the comparison of each possible answer, a self-aware person is the most appropriate description of Addison."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down. suppose Load dishes directly into dishwasher after use happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The process you've described is a natural process, specifically it is weathering which pertains to the breakdown of rocks due to various environmental factors such as water, temperature changes, and more. On the other side, loading dishes directly into the dishwasher after use is a distinctly separate process that pertains to household chores and hygiene management. In considering these two processes, it may initially be difficult to identify a clear link or influence between them, but for argument's sake, let's delve a little deeper for analysis. The loading of dishes into a dishwasher doesn't seem to have a direct or indirect impact on the weathering process you described. Here's how it impacts, or rather doesn't impact each step: 1. Water seeps into rocks - This part of weathering relies on natural forms of water like rain or groundwater, and not water used within a dishwasher. The water usage in the household doesn't impact the amount of water available to seep into rocks. 2. The water freezes and thaws - This process describes the natural mechanism of temperature variation, which again is not influenced by the action of a dishwasher. A dishwasher might heat and cool internally, but this has no bearing on external temperatures affecting rocks. 3. Cracks form in the rocks - The physical action of the dishwasher doesn't impact rocks in the environment. 4. Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The heat produced by a dishwasher is local to the dishwasher itself and won't increase the overall temperature in a way that could speed up the formation of cracks in rocks. 5. The rocks slowly break down - This eventual breakdown is a result of the previous steps, none of which are impacted by the dishwasher operation. The energy or substances used by the dishwasher won't be interacting with rocks in such a way as to hasten their breakdown. In conclusion, loading dishes directly into the dishwasher after use does not seem to have any direct or indirect impact on these steps that lead to weathering. Therefore, the supposed perturbation here would fall under 'not impacting any steps of the process.' It's crucial to note that while individual actions can have minor environmental impacts, they usually don't influence larger-scale natural processes like weathering, except perhaps in the case of significant environmental disruptions. But in the specific scenario described in your question, loading dishes directly into the dishwasher after use would not accelerate or increase weathering."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Mia De Graaf. Crammed full of dusty syringes, bottled antidotes, and rattling equipment - with a half-smoked pipe on the table - the owner of this doctor's surgery could have just popped out. But in fact it has lain derelict for more than a decade - and gathered a thick layer of dust over the years. Abandoned in mysterious circumstances, the mansion in Virton, Belgium, still has semi-full glasses of wine on the tables, and meticulously ordered equipment in antique glass cabinets smothered in cobwebs. Bygone era: The equipment in this old doctor's surgery in Virton, Belgium, was left in perfect order when it was abandoned in 1980 - despite slight decay. Ghost-like: The doctor's unfinished cigar, glasses and newspaper were left on the table as if he were half-way through his morning reading. French photographer Matti Decaux, 27, who found the home, said: 'This one is a strange for me, as it seems to be part home, part office and part surgery. 'It really felt odd wandering around, as it was as if the owner had just left for a paper and would return at any moment - the only way to tell otherwise was the layer of dust covering the contents of the property. 'The surgery area was very interesting as there was old equipment left behind, and it was all neatly laid out. Historic: The medicines cluttered around the house look ancient compared to our plastic packets today. Syringes and scalpels lie sprawled over glass-topped desks. Not quite the NHS: Patients would recline in a king size bed with plush blue satin sheets and a gold wooden frame facing the open windows. Mysteriously, open bottles and half-filled glasses remain on the tables, with coats slung on the back of the beautiful, velvet chairs. 'But, to be honest, with it being a. multi-use building there was much to see, all of which seemed as though. it was very well cared for when the owner was still there.' Seemingly abandoned at some point in the 1980s, the house in the south of Belgium has been dubbed 'Dr Pepito's mansion' and is made up of three stories - part residential and part surgery. Mr Decaux, 27, says: 'I receive a very mixed reaction from people who see these photographs. 'Some love to see them and hear the tales of what once may have gone on in there. Although, some will just never understand why I find these places interesting. 'I really enjoy capturing places that once were loved but now have been left for Mother Nature to reclaim.' The house has become local legend, with many stories circulated about what could have happened to the family that left without notice or trace. French photographer Matti Decaux discovered a home 'reclaimed by Mother Nature' as he was investigating the myth of 'Dr Pepito's Mansion' Classic: A typical doctor's briefcase gathers dust on a chair in the corner of an office. Memories: Boxes of photographs all over the house span generations, including the family's landmarks events like weddings, births and birthdays. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article talks about an old doctor's house and surgery in Virton, Belgium that has been abandoned for many years.

The average parent will spend £51,000 on their child before their 18th birthday but one mother has decided to spend almost half of that elsewhere. Kerrie Williams,33, has spent over £20,000 on just seven lifelike dolls, while refusing to spend anything but the necessary on her two daughters. Kerrie a mother-of-two from Darlington, Country Durham has spent thousands on clothes, toys and accessories including a £1,000 pram for her collection of 'reborn' dolls. Kerrie Williams has spend £20,000 on her collection of re-born babies. The hyper-realistic toys are made from vinyl and designed to resemble human babies. And they don't come cheap with each doll costing between £150 and £400. Kerrie now owns seven of the dolls, who each have an enviable collection of accessories, and her expensive habit has left her with little spare cash for her two real daughters Karina, 13 and Jade, 12. Kerrie admits that she has to scrimp on what she buys for her daughters in order to spoil her fake babies and that Karina and Jade are becoming increasingly jealous of the attention their mother lavishes on her toys. Kerrie's two daughters Jade (left) and Karina (right) have had to go without new clothes in order to fund their mum's habit. 'My daughters are always asking me for new clothes. I tell them it's a waste of money because they will grow out of them' says Kerrie. The part-time carer's collection of doll's clothes and accessories includes designer labels such as Ralph Lauren and converse. 'Karina wanted a pair of Vans trainers and was furious when I told her I couldn't afford them. 'She gets jealous because I bought the reborns the same pair - but they can wear them forever.' Kerrie began collecting reborn dolls to cope with a miscarriage she suffered in January 2012. She says that her fake babies helped to comfort her when no one else would. 'I was 12 weeks pregnant when I miscarried and I hit rock bottom afterwards. I just desperately wanted another child. As well as the dolls Kerrie has spent thousands of pounds on accessories including clothes, shoes and prams. Kerrie's clothing collection includes designer labels such as Ralph Lauren, Converse and Doctor Martins. 'My daughters were too old for my hugs and attention. They preferred to go out with their friends instead. 'I love my daughters so much, but babies are completely dependent on their mums, and all I wanted was another little one to hold.' The doting mum saw a picture of a reborn on Facebook and instantly fell in love with the child's angelic plastic features and mistook it for an actual baby. 'He had perfect blonde hair and looked so peaceful. All I wanted was to scoop him up in my arms. I was so shocked when I discovered the baby, named Owen, was a reborn. 'He looked so realistic, so I called the manufacturer straight away to place an order.' The first fake addition to Kerrie's family arrived in May 2012, but her daughters and now ex-partner Paul, 35, were unimpressed. Kerrie says that their mother's new interest left the family a little confused. 'I hoped the baby could replace the child we had lost - but instead my family said Owen was weird.' Undeterred, she handpicked another six dolls over the course of the next year - splashing out on Serenity, Wynter, twins Corey and Cody, and vampire babies Lillith and Lilliana. The mum also sold her first reborn, Owen, after deciding he no longer looked realistic when compared to her other dolls. Last December she added a reborn named Till, who was designed to look like the child she lost. Kerrie began collecting the dolls after a miscarriage left her at rock bottom. Kerrie mistook her first doll Owen (pictured) for a real child when she saw a photo on Facebook. Kerrie now has seven of the re-born dolls. Following her purchase of Owen Kerrie picked out a further six dolls over that year including the twins (left), Corey (right) Cody. Kerrie has baby Till designed to look like the child she lost. Kerrie has also purchased two 'vampire babies' complete with fangs Lillian (left) and Lillith (right) 'I provided the designer with my features and Paul's too' says Kerrie who adds that rather than solving her marital issues Till drove her and her partner further apart. 'I hoped Till would bring us closer together, but instead Paul became very uncomfortable with the dolls and banned them from sleeping in our bedroom. 'We split up soon after Till arrived.' Single Kerrie often takes her babies out in one of their four pushchairs, visiting the local park, or ASDA superstore to try on baby clothes. Despite the babies being entirely fake Kerrie says that the public like to interact with them. 'I love getting the babies dressed up and taking them shopping around town with me. 'Most of the time people are lovely to them - they like to ask me how they're getting on.' Occasionally Kerrie is met with harsh criticism from people who find her obsession odd. 'Usually people believe they're real babies unless I tell them otherwise but sometimes I hear strangers laughing at me. 'They taunt the babies and say they look like dead children, but I think my babies are beautiful.' One set of Kerrie's dolls have even began to frighten her daughters as they take the form of a Halloween character. 'I have two vampire babies, named Lillith and Lilliana. The moment I saw them I knew they had to live with me. Kerrie often takes her dolls to the supermarket in their prams and says that many people mistake them for real babies. Kerrie had a doll designed to look just like her eldest daughter Karina (right) but Karina says she thinks it looks scary. Serenity has been designed to look as though she is laughing. 'My daughters find them scary but they're as special to me as real children.' With four moses baskets, four prams and more than 50 pairs of shoes, Kerrie's daughters have had to get used to sharing their home. 'I know the girls are jealous because I've spent twice as much on the babies.' But the reborn addict's plan to help her daughter Karina fall in love with her plastic brothers and sisters failed. Kerrie purchased a new baby, named Saffron, in July designed to look exactly like her eldest daughter, which she hoped would bring the family closer, however Karina was unimpressed. 'I designed a special doll to look just like Karina did as a baby and I hoped she'd bring us closer together as a family. 'But Karina doesn't like her and thinks she's ugly.' However this has not deterred Kerrie who is now in the process of designing her latest doll to look like her younger daughter Jade. Kerrie says that although she spends more on her fake babies they will never be more loved than her actual daughters, however this is not going to stop her spoiling them. 'Reborn babies can never replace how special my real children are, but I still love my dolls - no matter what anyone thinks. 'They're always worth spoiling - babies this perfect are worth every penny.' Although the dolls already take up all the spare room in her house, Kerrie has plans to expand her plastic brood and in December, doll Megan will join the clan. It was her interest in dolls that eventually led to the break down of her marriage with her husband leaving shortly after she bought home Ti. Although Kerrie says that her dolls will never make up for what she lost they have provided her with some comfort when no one else could. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are: 1. Kerrie Williams, a 33-year-old mother from Darlington, Country Durham, has spent over £20,000 on just seven lifelike reborn dolls while refusing to spend anything but the necessary on her two daughters. 2. Reborn dolls are hyper-realistic toys made from vinyl, designed to resemble human babies, and can cost between £150 and £400. 3. Kerrie's collection includes clothes, toys, and accessories from designer labels like Ralph Lauren, Converse, and Doctor Martins. 4. Her two daughters, Karina and Jade, have grown increasingly jealous of the attention their mother lavishes on her dolls as Kerrie scrimps on what she buys for them. 5. Kerrie began collecting reborn dolls to cope with a miscarriage she suffered in January 2012, believing that the dolls provided her with comfort no one else could. 6. The addition of the dolls to her family caused tension and eventually led to the breakdown of her marriage. 7.

Article: For years and years people have been saying that the rail ways are dead. \\"We can do without railways\\", people say as if motorcars and planes have made the railways unnecessary. We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, and that they're dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams. And a single train can carry goods which no plane or motorcar could ever do. Far from being dead, the railways are very much alive. Modern railway lines give you a smooth, untroubled journey.

Question: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Q: The dumbest thing that actually worked? I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

Information: - Siberia is an extensive geographical region, and by the broadest definition is also known as North Asia. Siberia has historically been a part of Russia since the 17th century. - Central Asia or Middle Asia is the core region of the Asian continent and stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north. It is also colloquially referred to as \\"the 'stans\\" (as the six countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the Persian suffix \\"-stan\\", meaning \\"land of\\") and is within the scope of the wider Eurasian continent. - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - An oblast is a type of administrative division of Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the now-defunct Soviet Union and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The term is analogous to \\"state\\" or \\"province\\". - The Bolsheviks, originally also Bolshevists or Bolsheviki (derived from \\"bol'shinstvo\\", \\"majority\\", literally meaning \\"one of the majority\\") were a faction of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) which split apart from the Menshevik faction at the Second Party Congress in 1903. The RSDLP was a revolutionary socialist political party formed in 1898 in Minsk(Belarus) to unite the various revolutionary organisations of the Russian Empire into one party. - The All-Russian Central Executive Committee ((VTsIK)), was the highest legislative, administrative, and revising body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR) from 1917 until 1937. Although the All-Russian Congress of Soviets had supreme authority, in periods between its sessions its powers were passed to VTsIK. - Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov (known by pseudonyms \\"Andrei\\", \\"Mikhalych\\", \\"Max\\", \\"Smirnov\\", \\"Permyakov\\"; 16 March 1919) was a Bolshevik party administrator and chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. - A dictator is a ruler who wields absolute power. A state ruled by a dictator is called a dictatorship. The word originated as the title of a magistrate in the Roman Republic appointed by the Senate to rule the republic in times of emergency (see Roman dictator and \\"justitium\\"). - Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel or Vrangel (\\"Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Vrangel\\" April 25, 1928) was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and later commanding general of the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Southern Russia in the later stages of the Russian Civil War. After his side lost the civil war in 1920, he left Russia and became one of the most prominent exiled White émigrés. - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen. - The Green armies, Green Army (Russian: \\" \\"), or Greens (Russian: \\"\\") were armed peasant groups which fought against all governments in the Russian Civil War of 191722. They fought to protect their communities from requisitions or reprisals carried out by third parties. At times associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (by far the largest grouping of the Russian Constituent Assembly elected in 1917), the Green Armies had at least tacit support throughout much of Russia. However, the Green Armies' primary base, the peasantry, were largely reluctant to wage an active campaign during the Russian Civil War. Its strength during the civil war has been measured at 40,000 men. - An uyezd was an administrative subdivision of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Russian Empire, and the early Russian SFSR, which was in use from the 13th century. For most of Russian history, uyezds were a secondary-level of administrative division. - Secret police (sometimes called political police) are intelligence services or police and law enforcement agencies which operate in secrecy. Therefore, they have little to no transparency, accountability or oversight. A secret police organization is often used beyond the law by totalitarian states to protect the political power of an individual dictator or an authoritarian (autocratic) political regime. - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin ( 21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets. The new government called elections for the Constituent Assembly and... - The Red Terror was a campaign of mass killings , torture , and systematic oppression conducted by the Bolsheviks after they seized power in Petrograd and Moscow in 1917 . Soviet historiography describes the Red Terror as having been officially announced in September 1918 by Yakov Sverdlov and ending about October 1918 . However , the term was frequently applied to political repression during the whole period of the Russian Civil War of 1918 -- 1922 . The Cheka ( the Bolshevik secret police ) conducted the mass repressions . Estimates for the total number of people killed in the Red Terror range from 50,000 to 140,000 to over one and a half million . - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Cheka ( \\"chrezvychaynaya komissiya\\", Emergency Committee) was the first of a succession of Soviet state security organizations. It was created on December 20, 1917, after a decree issued by Vladimir Lenin, and was subsequently led by Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Polish aristocrat turned communist. By late 1918, hundreds of Cheka committees had been created in various cities, at multiple levels including: oblast, guberniya (\\"Gubcheks\\"), raion, uyezd, and volost Chekas, with Raion and Volost Extraordinary Commissioners. After 1922, Cheka groups underwent a series of reorganizations, with the NKVD, into bodies whose members continued to be referred to as \\"Chekisty\\" (Chekists) into the late 1980s.

What went so wrong with Trump sons that they could kill this beautiful creature pic.twitter.com/L1gquLQrRz — mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) May 13, 2015 In the heat of the campaign – and during a particularly brutal week for their father — Donald Trump’s two sons suddenly disappeared. Donald Jr. and Eric, according to reports, left the country on a hunting trip. Beyond that, curiously little is known. Bloomberg Politics reported that the trip was a fundraiser for a foundation run by family members of Tyrone Woods, a Navy SEAL slain in the Benghazi, Libya, attack. Various political reporters heard that they fled to the Yukon, a favorite hunting location of Donald Jr. He then posted an Instagram photo of himself with his son, which showed them in Canada for a “Father son trip” — but in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The campaign didn’t respond to requests for more information. Their media silence could very well be just mean they’re on a needed vacation. But it could also be a way to dodge the uncomfortable subject of the Trump sons’ well-documented love of hunting — a subject that stalks them on social media like one of the very large predators they have killed for sport. [The death of Cecil the lion and the big business of big game trophy hunting] It all started in 2012, when photos of the sons with big-game trophies leaked to an animal rights group, and then exploded on social media. Gothamist reported that the photos showed the men posing with “a dead elephant, kudu, civet cat and waterbuck while on a big game safari in Zimbabwe.” In one shot, Gothamist said, “Donald Jr. proudly holds a dead elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other. In another, the brothers are seen standing beside a 12’8″ crocodile hanging from a noose off a tree.” It was a time when big-game hunting became a fresh cause for social media shaming (see GoDaddy CEO Bob Parsons, and his notorious elephant video). The photos have regularly resurfaced ever since. The GOP.

They outfitted journalists in camo and took them on pheasant hunts in Iowa, where the sport remains popular. That possibly humanized the Trumps, making them seem less Cartier, more Carhartt. [Hunting pheasants with the Trump sons] Still, a November Marist poll showed that Americans are nearly split when it comes to hunting animals for sport — 56 percent said they oppose it — and they are particularly against big-game hunting. Eighty-six percent of respondents said they disapprove of it, and six out of 10 said they believe it should be illegal. Donald Jr. spoke in exhaustive detail about his love of hunting for the enthusiast site Bowsite earlier in the year. He explained that he learned to hunt as a boy from his maternal grandfather during summers spent in Czechoslovakia. He said he has been an active hunter throughout his life, that his preferred form is bowhunting, and that he frequently employs it during the weekends to hunt whitetail deer in New York. “Almost every weekend I’m out doing something,” he said. He talked of hunting not just as a pastime, but as an important influence on his character. “I owe the outdoors way too much to try to do the usual apologize and hide thing,” Trump Jr. said. “It’s kept me out of a lot of other trouble I probably would’ve gotten into.” What might the Trumps be hunting in Canada? “Caribou, moose, muskox, bison, wolves, polar bears, grizzly bears, black bears and Dall’s sheep” are all available to hunt, with the proper licenses. But so far, they’re keeping quiet about it. Possibly, in our post-Cecil the Lion era, they sense it as too big of a political weakness. If it is, then Hillary Clinton has already picked up on the scent. When animal rights protesters interrupted a speech Thursday, she didn’t seem to miss a step. “Apparently, these people are here to protest Trump,” she said. “Because Trump and his kids have killed a lot of animals, so thank you for making that point.” Secret Service agents surrounded Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton after animal-rights protesters created a disturbance at a rally in Las Vegas on Aug. 4. Clinton later joked the protesters must be looking for Republican rival Donald Trump's children, who are currently on a hunting trip.

Principal Waynes Kettler said he's worked with many outstanding teachers in his 22 years as an educator, but Peterson is \\"just that one step above anybody I've ever worked with before.\\" Kettler and others at Monte Cristo Elementary School talk about the ways she has introduced the learning from other classrooms into her music program and her creativity in working around things such as the lack of money for new music.

As I stared at the wreckage, I could feel the heat rushing through my veins, the adrenaline surging through my body, and the tempest of my anguish swirling uncontrollably within me. My thoughts turned to the source of my pain – the relentless, inescapable misery that had left me shattered, just like the remnants of the glass in front of me. It started off subtly, an insidious force creeping into my life without my even noticing it. A word, a glance, a careless action or inaction – that's all it took for the roots of despair to start embedding themselves within my very being. Gradually, it infiltrated every aspect of my life, tainting everything with its darkness. My once vibrant relationships, the simple joys of everyday adventures, even the quiet sanctuary of my most introspective moments – everything had been contaminated by this pervasive sense of hopelessness, self-doubt, and unyielding sorrow. Seeking solace, I tried reaching out, confiding in those I trusted most. But their words failed to penetrate the impenetrable fortress I had built around myself. Their understanding, their sympathy – it was all like a predesigned script they were playing out, and I was left feeling even more isolated and misunderstood. I couldn't blame them, though.

There would be no comforting embrace to save me from my demons, no enlightening words to chase away the shadowy fog of desolation. I was adrift in a churning sea of torment, spiraling deeper and deeper into the abyss with no lifeline in sight. The breaking point came on a night much like any other, my heart heavy with the weight of unexpressed emotion. It was then when I found myself staring at the empty glass beside me, and the culmination of all my repressed anger and pain propelled me into violent action. The shards of glass now before me were a tangible reflection of my fragmented soul. In that moment, something within me shifted. The echoing sound of the shattering glass seemed to slice through the oppressive silence that had defined my existence for so long. Amid the chaos and ruin, a sliver of clarity dawned on me. Perhaps the destruction of the glass was not just a physical manifestation of my emotions but was also symbolic of something more significant – a catalyst for change, for healing. Could I dare to believe that beneath the broken shards of what once was, there lay the potential for growth and transformation? That maybe it wasn't too late to rebuild and reshape my world, my perceptions, and myself? Only time would tell.

The World health Organization (WHO) observes that the introduction of air conditioning and energy conservation measures have been accompanied by growing problems of indoor air quality. Some pollutants arise from insulation products, some from moving cars, and others from modern housing materials. As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important. Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde . Heat and humidity increase the release of formaldehyde and the gas seriously harms the eyes. Paint, lacquer, etc. can also release dangerous gas into indoor air. Construction materials can cause serious damage, especially when they contain asbestos . Asbestos is naturally present in rock formations worldwide. It belongs to a family of mineral substances made up of solid, non-combustible fiber. These properties make asbestos a highly sought-after construction material.

FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public.

A third porn star has reportedly tested positive for HIV, adding more concern that an outbreak is underway among adult entertainment performers. Two other performers- Cameron Bay and Rod Daily- have come forward and announced that they tested positive, but the third infectee has not revealed their name. Radar Online reports that 'a dozen female performers have been quarantined as a result of exposure' as a result of the third case. The latest case is renewing concerns over the health of porn stars as a result of the growing number who have confirmed sexually transmitted diseases. Scroll down for video. Diagnosed: Rod Daily, 32, announced via Twitter that he was recently diagnosed with HIV. After Cameron Bay came out as being. infected, a brief moratorium was issued that stopped all productions of. pornographic films, but that was lifted just days later. When. Rod Daily announced via Twitter that he had tested positive for HIV. less than two weeks after Bay made her announcement, he advocated for. further precautions to be taken. 'Drumroll. please!! I'm 32 years old and I'm HIV positive. Acute HIV, which means I. recently was infected. For that I am blessed,' Daily wrote on Twitter. on Tuesday. 'I'm blessed for the fact that I caught it so early that I can blast that s*** with meds. 'With the tests I have done the doctors have figured out that I was infected within the last month...My antibodies just showed up on a test this week which is scary because they didn't a week ago,' he said in two other tweets. A trade group representing producers of pornographic movies in Los Angeles called on any of Daily's sexual partners to be tested for the virus. However, the group, the Free Speech Coalition, stepped short of calling for a moratorium on adult film productions. Positive attitude: Daily, who has been in the adult film industry for eight years, said that hopefully this will encourage porn stars to wear condoms. Out in the open: Daily announced his positive diagnosis on Twitter Tuesday. The group said it could not yet confirm whether Daily truly had contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, but it warned his partners to be tested. The Free Speech Coalition were the ones to confirm on August 22 that the actress who goes by the name of Cameron Bay was also infected with HIV. Daily has been linked romantically to Bay on the adult film industry website XBiz.com. California Assemblyman Isadore Hall, who has been trying for months to get a bill passed in the state Assembly mandating the use of condoms in sex scenes, said Daily's reported infection shows the need for such a regulation. 'This is the second individual within a week and a half to contract HIV in the industry,' said Hall, a Democrat. 'There will probably be more.' The multibillion-dollar adult film industry is centered in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. Distraught: Cameron Bay's agent says his client, whose recent HIV diagnosis has brought the porn industry to a standstill, is 'distraught' over the news. Risk: Xander Corvus, left, who played Weiner in. the movie with Sydney Leathers, had unprotected sex with Cameron Bay,. right, a few weeks ago - who has just been told she has HIV. Debut: Sydney Leathers porn movie was released yesterday where she stars alongside Xander Corvus. The industry has vigorously opposed. efforts to require condom use on set, protesting against a 2012. voter-approved measure requiring condoms to be used in Los Angeles. County and successfully arguing against an earlier effort for such. regulation at the state level that would be specifically geared to film. productions. The Free Speech. Coalition said in an email to Reuters that Daily acted in gay and. transsexual sex movies in which condoms were used. After Bay tested positive, production was shut down for about a week. Medical signs: Daily said that the test suggests he contracted HIV in the past month. But as of early evening on Tuesday, no order to cease shooting sex scenes had been issued. In. a series of Twitter postings, Daily cited this brief moratorium as an. example of how the industry is unwilling to change- to the detriment of. it's actors. 'That does not change anything though. A week later people are back at it shooting without condoms. 'I have also learned that people can be so well medicated that they test negative. Scary, the test everyone relies on. 'Magic Johnson has HIV, and can infect other people but his test comes up negative. Is that so impossible for anyone else to do the same? NO. 'Just sayin be careful because that test ain't shit without a condom strapped up with it.' Daily appears to be taking a positive approach to the news, staying optimistic by saying: 'Had to pinch myself a few times no doubt. But the sun still shines on my face and its warm. Can't take my heart ever. I love life, blessed.' 'I felt bad for the guy who had to read me my first test result. His face turned to stone, I wanted to give him a hug and say it will be ok.' Bay's scare resonated outside of the porn industry, as it was revealed that she had recently had sex with the male performer who later appeared in a video starring Sydney Leathers, disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting partner.","completion":"A third adult entertainment performer has tested positive for HIV, increasing concerns over an outbreak among the industry.

As he helped the Queen to open the new British Embassy in Berlin in 2000, the royal was memorably overheard describing the building as 'ghastly'. Now the Duke of Edinburgh is set to make a return to the city - and the embassy - after Buckingham Palace announced that the prince will travel with the Queen to Germany this summer. The tour, which will be the Queen's first to the country since 2004, follows an invitation from President Joachim Gauck, a former East German dissident. On her travels: Buckingham Palace has announced that the Queen and Prince Philip will visit Germany. Visit: The Queen's last visit abroad was in June 2014 when she made a state visit to France. Remembrance: The visit was to mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy Landings on the 6th June 1944. Mr Gauck and his partner, Daniela Schadt, were the guests of the Queen and Duke at a lunch at Buckingham Palace in November 2012. Buckingham Palace said in a short statement: 'The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will make a state visit to the Federal Republic of Germany from 24 to 26 June. 'Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are visiting at the invitation of the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Joachim Gauck.' The tour will be the first international visit undertaken by the 88-year-old monarch since the state visit to France for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day Landings last year. Meeting: The Queen was invited by President Gauck (left) but is likely to meet with Chancellor Merkel as well. Regular visitor: The Queen, who last travelled to Germany in 2004, has made several visits to the country. Warm welcome: The Queen and Prince Philip wave to well-wishers in Potsdam during their 1992 visit. Partition: The Queen also visited during the Cold War in 1978, at the request of then President Walter Scheel. First trip: The Queen travelled to West Germany 10 years after the end of WW2. She is seen here in Stuttgart. During that trip, the Queen took part in a ceremony at Sword Beach, the scene of 683 British deaths, alongside David Cameron, Germany's Chancellor Merkel and President Obama. She also took the opportunity to reiterate her admiration for the men who fought during the Normandy campaign during a speech at the Élysée Palace, telling France's President Hollande:. ‘The true measure of all our actions is how long the good in them last. Each year has compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World War. 'Seen in that light, those heroic deeds will stand out as much in 700 years as they do after 70.' Her Majesty has remained in the UK since returning from that visit, although the Duke of Edinburgh has made several trips to the Athlone Barracks in the German village of Sennelager near Paderborn. Regular visitor: The Duke of Edinburgh regularly visits the Athlone Barracks and the Queen's Royal Hussars. Colonel-in-chief: He last visited the regiment in November and handed out Afghanistan campaign medals. Meeting: Angela Merkel is likely to meet the royal couple and last met the Queen in February 2014 in London. His most recent trip was in November, when he welcomed home members of the Queen's Royal Hussars, who were among the last soldiers to leave Afghanistan. Prince Philip is the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief and regularly visits the men, as well as handing out combat medals to veterans. While it is not known whether a visit to the Barracks will be included in the itinerary for June's tour, a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel is almost certain. The 60-year-old politician has met the Queen several times, most recently during a state visit to Britain that she made in February 2014. Welcomed by the monarch to Buckingham Palace, the German premier offered Her Majesty an awkward handshake in front of the cameras before being whisked away for a private afternoon tea. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In 2000, Prince Philip made headlines when he referred to the new British Embassy in Berlin as \\"ghastly\\" during its official opening with Queen Elizabeth II.

When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.

I heard that Kai went back to my house to find their wallet, but it wasn't there. And I was wondering How would Kai feel afterwards? Pick from: i. afraid his wallet was stolen; ii. kind of excited; iii. somewhat worried; Answer:","completion":"Kai would likely feel somewhat worried after searching your house and not finding their wallet. This is because wallet misplacement can lead to various concerns and potential complications. Firstly, a wallet typically contains a person's essential personal identification, such as driver's licenses, ID cards, or passports. Losing track of these items may make it much more difficult for a person to prove their identity when required to do so. Additionally, replacing these documents can be a tedious and time-consuming process. Consequently, Kai's inability to locate their wallet might intensify their concerns about undergoing these processes. Secondly, a wallet usually stores financial information, credit and debit cards, or cash. If Kai's wallet has gone missing, they may worry about being left without immediate access to funds. This could have a large impact on their short-term ability to make purchases, go out to eat, or pay their bills. Moreover, once they realize the wallet is missing, they will have to shoulder the responsibility of contacting banks and credit card companies to cancel their cards and protect their accounts from potential fraudulent transactions. Lastly, sentimental items may also be kept in wallets, such as photos, notes, or small tokens. Losing irreplaceable personal mementos is disconcerting and might add an emotional component to Kai's concerns. While Kai may experience varying degrees of stress depending on the contents of their wallet, it's reasonable to assume that their current emotional state would be characterized by some worry. Rather than immediate fear or excitement, they would probably remain vigilant and continue their search while hoping that the wallet resurfaces or hasn't been stolen.

Later, he issued a warning: if Spain's central government in Madrid doesn't give the region more control over its tax dollars, independence could be an option. \\"If we do not reach a financial agreement with the central government, the path to freedom for Catalonia is open,\\" he said. \\"If you compare the money we send to Madrid every year and the money we get back from OPTIONS: - Artur Mas, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Barcelona, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Catalonia, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Madrid, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Spain, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. - Spanish, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June.","completion":"Spain, there is a difference -- a near difference of 20 billion,\\" Mas told CNN in June. This discontent over the allocation of tax dollars has long been an issue between Catalonia and the central government. Pro-independence politicians argue that the region contributes more to the Spanish economy than it receives in return, and they believe that Catalans should have more control over their own resources. The heightened pressure from the economic crisis has only amplified these grievances. In response to the massive demonstrations, the central government in Madrid called for dialogue with Catalonia's regional government. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy expressed a willingness to discuss the region's fiscal grievances but maintained that constitutional changes would be necessary for any alterations to the current system. However, the pro-independence movement has grown increasingly skeptical of Madrid's willingness to engage in meaningful negotiations. As a consequence, Catalonia's regional government announced plans to hold a referendum on independence from Spain in the following months, further escalating tensions between the two sides. This move alarmed both the European Union and the Spanish central government, who warned against any unilateral actions that might endanger regional stability and European integration. In the lead-up to the referendum, the central government continued to emphasize the importance of unity and negotiation, employing legal challenges and political pressure to try to block the vote. On the other hand, pro-independence leaders in Catalonia remained undeterred, framing the referendum as a fundamental expression of democratic rights. Ultimately, the clash between the central government and Catalonia resulted in a controversial and contested vote, with both sides claiming victory in their respective narratives. While the immediate outcome remained uncertain, what was clear was that the tensions between Catalonia and Madrid would persist, further complicating the broader economic and political landscape in Spain and the European Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And the answer is?","completion":"Blue Castello cheese, also known as Castello Danish Blue or simply Castello Blue, is made in Denmark. Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe, known for its highly skilled dairy industry, rich history, and delicious cheeses. The history of Blue Castello dates back to the early 20th century when Danish cheesemaker Rasmus Tholstrup established his first dairy in the village of Fåborg. In 1969, Rasmus's grandson, Erik Tholstrup Michael, created the Blue Castello cheese, which quickly gained popularity for its unique taste and texture. Nowadays, Blue Castello is produced by Arla Foods, a prominent dairy cooperative in Denmark. Blue Castello cheese is a mild, creamy, and slightly tangy blue cheese made from cow's milk. The cheese is characterized by its soft and crumbly texture, distinctive blue-green veins due to the presence of Penicillium Roqueforti, and an edible mold rind. The flavor profile of Blue Castello is a perfect balance of creaminess and mild pungency, making it a favorite among blue cheese lovers and those who are new to the world of blue cheeses. In terms of pairing, Blue Castello is versatile and can be paired with various food items and beverages. It goes well with fresh fruits like apples, pears, and grapes, as well as dried fruits like figs and apricots. Bread and crackers also make excellent accompaniments for this cheese. To complement the flavors of Blue Castello, one can pair it with sweet dessert wines, full-bodied red wines, and even beers such as Porters and Stouts. In conclusion, Blue Castello cheese is a delectable and flavorful Danish blue cheese created in the 1960s and is a testament to the rich dairy traditions of Denmark.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. and the situation: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Answer the following question: Which group of larvae had more somatic mutations?

Process: - Bees first secure the perfect spot, such as hollow areas of trees - Bees will begin to chew max until it becomes softened - The chewed up wax will be stored inside of a honeycomb - Worker bees continue chewing and softening wax from within - The chewed up wax is steadily added, making the hive bigger and bigger - The bees will house nectar, honey and pollen within the honeycomb's cells - Question: suppose an ideal spot is not found happens, how will it affect more honey is produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"If an ideal spot is not found for a hive, it can lead to less honey being produced. The reason for this is that bees require a suitable, well-protected environment to store nectar and pollen, as well as to raise their young. In an unsuitable location, the bees may be more exposed to predators and harsh weather conditions, which can affect their ability to collect nectar and properly maintain the hive. Since the second effect mentioned is about worker bees continuing to chew and soften wax from within, the perturbation of not finding an ideal spot might have a negative impact on this process as well. Bees might have to spend more time and energy on maintaining the hive and defending it against threats rather than focusing on these essential tasks. As a result, there might be less chewed-up wax available for hive expansion, which could further limit honey storage capacity and lead to even less honey being produced. In summary, if bees do not find an ideal spot for their hive, it can lead to less honey being produced and negatively affect the process of worker bees chewing and softening wax for hive expansion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

Its flavor is described as earthy, sweet, and savory, with some people likening it to mushrooms. Due to its distinctive taste, huitlacoche is sought after and used as a filling in various traditional Mexican dishes like quesadillas, tacos, tamales, and other tortilla-based foods. It can also be incorporated into soups, adding an extra layer of flavor and texture. The popularity of huitlacoche is not limited to Mexico, as interest in using unique and exotic ingredients in the culinary world has grown in recent years. Chefs and foodies worldwide have started experimenting with this edible fungus, incorporating it into both traditional and fusion recipes.

Magi Locke and the group proceeded cautiously, curious about the urgent announcement and the reason behind the assembly. The northern part of the grounds was known for its beautifully crafted gardens and carefully pruned tree sculptures. It was a place cherished by the school members as a calming sanctuary. The maze that now lay before them only added to the students' excitement. The intricate web of plants was an architectural wonder, designed to guide those who entered it towards enlightenment and self-discovery. As they passed through the maze, they couldn't help but marvel at the dazzling variety of plant life that surrounded them. Many of these plants were actually rare magical flora, collected from all corners of the world. There were Whispering Willows whose leaves softly hummed melodies, and the ever-popular Glittering Gladiolas that emitted a soft, shimmering glow at twilight. This unique collection of plants was a testimony to the school's dedication to preserving magic in all its forms. Upon reaching the side entrance of the main building, Magi Locke paused for a moment to catch his breath. His face was etched with worry, as the announcement through the loudspeakers had been abrupt and out of the ordinary. The group exchanged uneasy glances before following Magi Locke into the building. The corridors echoed with the distant footsteps of faculty and students alike, all hurrying towards the main audience hall. The main audience hall itself was an architectural marvel, designed to accommodate the entire school population. The grand room boasted high, vaulted ceilings adorned with stunning murals depicting the history of magic. Beautifully carved wooden benches, reminiscent of great oak trees, stood in neat rows, waiting to be filled by the school's inhabitants. At the far end of the hall, a grand stage made of polished marble silently awaited the bearer of news. As the hall filled with the chatter of curious faculty and students, Magi Locke guided the group to their designated seats. The air was thick with anticipation, and whispers reverberated as everyone tried to guess the purpose of this unexpected assembly. Some wondered if it was related to a magical discovery, while others speculated that a prominent figure was planning to visit the school. Regardless of what the rest of the students thought, Magi Locke's frown grew deeper, revealing his fears that the news might not be positive. Finally, when everyone had taken their seats, the headmaster stepped onto the stage. His tall, imposing figure, coupled with his traditional, ornate robes, silenced the chatter in the room almost instantly. With a solemn expression, he began to speak, addressing the concerns that flickered like a quiet flame in the hearts of everyone in the audience hall. His strong, resonant voice filled the space, and the entire school held their collective breath, waiting to hear the news that had interrupted their daily lives so unexpectedly. And so began the pivotal moment when Magi Locke, the students, and faculty would be faced with an unforeseen challenge, one that would test their resilience and magic as never before.

Answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does Kane probably think of Mike Pompeo?

Background: Joe Tex was born Joseph Arrington, Jr. in Rogers, Texas, in Bell County to Joseph Arrington and Cherie Sue (Jackson) Arrington. He and his sister Mary Sue were initially raised by their grandmother, Mary Richardson. After their parents divorced, Cheri Arrington moved to Baytown. Tex played baritone saxophone in the high-school band and sang in a local Pentecostal church choir. Context: Tex recorded his first hit, \\"Hold On To What You've Got\\", in November 1964 at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He was unconvinced the song would be a hit and advised Killen not to release it. However, Killen felt otherwise and released the song in early 1965. By the time Tex got wind of its release, the song had already sold 200,000 copies. The song eventually peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Tex's first number-one hit on the R&B charts, staying on the charts for 11 weeks and selling more than a million copies by 1966. Tex placed six top-40 charted singles on the R&B charts in 1965 alone, including two more number-one hits, \\"I Want To (Do Everything For You)\\" and \\"A Sweet Woman Like You\\". He followed that with two successive albums, Hold On To What You've Got and The New Boss. He placed more R&B hits than any artist, including his rival James Brown. In 1966, five more singles entered the top 40 on the R&B charts, including \\"The Love You Save\\" and \\"S.Y.S.L.J.F.M.\\" or \\"The Letter Song\\", which was an answer song to Wilson Pickett's \\"634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)\\". His 1967 hits included \\"Show Me\\", which became an often-covered tune for British rock artists and later some country and pop artists, and his second million-selling hit, \\"Skinny Legs and All\\". The latter song, released off Tex's pseudo-live album, Live and Lively, stayed on the charts for 15 weeks and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in January 1968. After leaving Atlantic for Mercury, Tex had several more R&B hits including \\"Buying a Book\\" in 1970 and \\"Give the Baby Anything the Baby Wants\\" in 1971. The intro saxophone riffs in his 1969 song, \\"You're Right, Ray Charles\\" later influenced Funkadelic's \\"Standing on the Verge of Gettin' It On\\". Tex recorded his next big hit, \\"I Gotcha\\", in December 1971. The song was released in January 1972 and stayed on the charts for 20 weeks, staying at number two on the Hot 100 for two weeks and sold more than 2 million copies, becoming his biggest-selling hit to date. Tex was offered a gold disc of the song on March 22, 1972. The parent album reached number 17 on the pop albums chart. Following this and another album, Tex announced his retirement from show business in September 1972 to pursue life as a minister for Islam. Tex returned to his music career following the death of Elijah Muhammad in 1975, releasing the top-40 R&B hit, \\"Under Your Powerful Love\\". His last hit, \\"Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)\\", was released in 1977 and peaked at number 12 on the Hot 100 and number 2 in the UK. His last public appearances were as part of a revised 1980s version of the Soul Clan in 1981. After that, Tex withdrew from public life, settling at his ranch in Navasota, Texas, and watching football games by his favorite team, the Houston Oilers. Question: Did the song do well for him? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the song \\"Hold On To What You've Got\\" did very well for Joe Tex. It became his first number-one hit on the R&B charts, peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, stayed on the charts for 11 weeks, and sold more than a million copies by 1966."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to find the longest common subsequence in the lists A and B. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Here's how to approach the task: 1. Understand the given lists: List A: ['u', 3629, 'A', 2837, 'i', 'd', 'Z', 'y', 421, 'N', 'L', 6323, 'n', 567, 3387, ...] List B: ['U', 'c', 8073, 5143, 'i', 7461, 3821, 'g', '9019', 'p', 'V', '6489', 'v', '6153', ...] 2. Recognize that you're looking for the longest common subsequence in both lists, which means you need to find the largest set of elements that appear in the same order in both lists. 3. To do this, you can use a dynamic programming approach that compares elements in both lists and keeps track of the longest subsequence found so far in a matrix. Here are simple steps to find the answer: Step 1: Create an empty matrix with dimensions (length of List A + 1) x (length of List B + 1). Step 2: Iterate through each element in List A (rows) and List B (columns). Step 3: For each element, compare if the current elements in both lists are the same. Step 4: If the elements are the same, fill in the current cell in the matrix with the value of the previous diagonal cell incremented by 1. Step 5: If the elements are not the same, fill in the current cell in the matrix with the maximum value between the cell above and the cell to the left. Step 6: Continue iterating through the lists and filling the matrix until all elements are compared. Step 7: The final cell in the matrix (bottom-right) will hold the length of the longest common subsequence. Step 8: To find the actual subsequence, backtrack from the bottom-right cell of the filled matrix going either upwards, diagonally-up-left, or left depending on the cell values. Step 9: When backtracking diagonally-up-left, append the current element from List A or List B (since they are the same) to the common subsequence. Step 10: Continue this backtracking process until you reach the first row or column in the matrix. Step 11: The collected elements during backtracking will form the longest common subsequence. Make sure to reverse the order of the collected elements to obtain the correct subsequence. By following these steps, you will find the longest common subsequence in the given Lists A and B."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 189*i - 1968 = 266*i + 958 for i, we will first move all terms containing 'i' on one side and all constant terms on the other side of the equation. Step 1: Move 'i' terms to the left side of the equation. To do this, we need to subtract 266*i from both sides: (189 * i - 1968) - 266 * i = (266 * i + 958) - 266 * i Simplifying the equation, we get: 189 * i - 266 * i - 1968 = 958 Step 2: Combine 'i' terms on the left side: (189 - 266) * i - 1968 = 958 which simplifies to: -77 * i - 1968 = 958 Step 3: Move constant terms to the right side of the equation. To do this, we need to add 1968 to both sides: -77 * i - 1968 + 1968 = 958 + 1968 Simplifying the equation, we get: -77 * i = 2926 Step 4: Solve for 'i' by dividing both sides by -77: i = 2926 / -77 Simplifying further, we find the value of i: i = -38 So, the answer is i = -38."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is the narrator likely feeling about their ex ?","completion":"The narrator is likely feeling a mix of emotions about their ex, primarily centered around nostalgia, sadness, and perhaps a sense of longing. These emotions stem from the fact that their birthday is approaching, and turning another year older without their ex by their side seems to be weighing heavily on their mind. It is apparent that the narrator misses having their ex as a partner, as they cannot help but think about them. They might wonder what could have been, had the relationship not ended. The saying \\"breaking up is hard to do\\" further emphasizes the emotional struggle that often comes with the dissolution of a once-valued partnership. The narrator acknowledges the pain and difficulty associated with the process of breaking up, which could mean that they are still in the process of healing from the emotional turmoil and loss surrounding their relationship. The reminiscing about their ex could also be triggering feelings of regret, questioning if the breakup was truly the best decision or if there was something more they could have done to save the relationship. We can also infer a sense of sadness from the narrator, since they are struggling to come to terms with the fact that they will not be celebrating their birthday with their ex as they might have done in the past. Additionally, the thought of their ex might also evoke bittersweet memories, contrasting the happy moments of their relationship with the pain of the eventual breakup. They could be experiencing moments of happiness when remembering the good times but also feel the weight of knowing that those moments have come to an end. In conclusion, the narrator is likely feeling a complex mix of emotions about their ex, such as nostalgia, sadness, longing, and perhaps regret. Their upcoming birthday has served as a catalyst for these feelings, as they are confronted with the reality of turning another year older without their once cherished partner by their side. The journey towards healing and moving on from a breakup can be challenging, as the narrator grapples with the bittersweet mixture of happy memories alongside the pain of having to let go."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No thanks The contents list of some properties these days can read like a user manual for the Battlestar Galactica. Lutron lighting and Cat 6 cabling, fingerprint entry systems and hydraulic car lifts. Baths that fill themselves – sometimes from the ceiling. Hobs that heat up instinctively, depending on where you’ve put your pan. The iPad didn’t even exist six years ago. Now we can control our entire homes from one, even when we’re thousands of miles away. But some buyers have had enough. They’re going retro, back to the old days of proper light switches, gadgets you can control manually and doors that require a key. “The rebirth of the dimmer switch is a wonderful thing,” says Marlon Lloyd Malcom of Lurot Brand. He thinks 11 Coleherne Mews in Earl’s Court – on sale for £1.95m – is a great example of the perfect mews house that’s “focused on the quality of finish, not gadgetry. What is more important, it seems, is the space and light of a property.” Mark Pollack, director of Aston Chase, is also seeing a genteel rebellion against unnecessary high-techery. He gives 138 Hamilton Terrace – on sale for £10.95m – as an example of a high-luxury but not high-tech home. “Many buyers are visibly withdrawing from the stereotypical contemporary look found in glossy lifestyle magazines. They’re yearning for an authentic home of genuine character without the impractical gadgets which one has come to expect from prime London developers,” he comments. Home-owners who over-indulge their passion for gadgetry may find their future prospective buyers are more traditionally-minded. The owners of one £4m Surrey mansion spent two years designing their home with every cutting-edge gimmick conceivable from keyless entry pads to mood-changing rooms. Beside the bed was a touch screen that could carry out a multitude of tasks including running the bath, opening the front gates and closing the blinds. The house took five years to sell. “The guy was an engineer, so he loved it. Prospective buyers were just daunted,” says the agent who, for obvious reasons, wishes to remain anonymous. Some central London developers are also realising that luxury doesn’t have to mean high-tech. Great Minster House, Barratt London’s redevelopment of an old government building in Westminster, has a feel of establishment elegance to it. They call it “colonial contemporary” and “modern traditional”, but what they are referring to are features such as heavy, three-metre high doors, high ceilings with feature flourishes and parquet floors in the flats, which cost from £975,000 and penthouses from £4.5m. The lack of smart technology isn’t deterring the iPad generation though; the first buyer was a 20-year-old app designer. Lighting effects and clever home automation have their place, but they can soon become outdated “and when these systems go wrong, it is spectacularly so,” says Roarie Scarisbrick, partner at Property Vision. A recent client of his was vehemently anti-iPad lighting. Instead, he installed hand-crafted, bespoke bronze light switches. Those with the biggest budgets also tend to have the keenest eye for identifying where every penny is spent – and high-tech often spells high premium. “The ability to create different moods in a room at the flick of a switch is hugely appealing, but there are now far simpler, more cost-effective ways to do it. It’s the same with AV equipment, with brands such as Sonos making the likes of Linn and Lutron look unnecessarily expensive and unduly complicated,” says Mark Pollack. It’s a similar situation with interior design. Those buying for pure investment or as a central London pad they’ll use once a year may be happy with the set menu of billionaires’ furniture packages. But buyers who want to create a genuine home want something more personal and less prescriptive. Developers and design company Fenton Whelan like to do that with chandeliers. They’ve just crafted 450kg of dangling crystal that descends three storeys of a Mayfair mansion on sale for £24m. Aneliese Dean, interiors architect for Landmark Lofts, says personalising a property isn’t something that can be done overnight. “It takes years to create the depth and character of a beautifully-conceived family home. It’s crucial to add to interiors over time to resist the overly staged effect created by many interior designers that was de rigueur a few years ago,” she comments. Just as “sophisticated” buyers balk at the premium asked for a high-tech home, they’re also wary of the inflated prices that come with branded interior-designed properties, says Camilla Dell from Black Brick buying agency. Although her services certainly don’t come cheap, one designer that Dell considers to have returned to “old school” design – “timelessly elegant rather than bling bling,” she says – is Rose Uniacke, the Beckhams’ designer of choice for the £5m revamp of their £31.5m Holland Park mansion. It’s rather more sophisticated than going back to basics, but who knew the good old light switch could command such devotion – and high prices? Summary:","completion":"The luxury property market is seeing a nostalgic shift away from high-tech gadgetry toward more traditional designs and practical features. Homeowners and buyers are now seeking properties with genuine character, as opposed to the contemporary, high-tech designs of recent years. Some central London developers, such as Barratt London, have ditched smart technology in their properties, instead opting for elegant interiors, high ceilings and parquet floors.

Write an article based on this \\"The fraud case against former SNP MP Michelle Thomson has been dropped due to an absence of sufficient evidence.\\"","completion":"Title: Fraud Case Against Ex-SNP MP Michelle Thomson Dropped Due to Insufficient Evidence Introduction: A fraud case against former Scottish National Party (SNP) MP Michelle Thomson has been dropped due to a lack of substantial evidence. Thomson faced allegations regarding a property transaction in 2010, surrounding the sale and purchase of real estate properties. However, the recent decision has put an end to the investigation and legal proceedings. The following article delves into the facts and reasons behind the dismissal of the case against the former MP. The Allegations: 1. In 2014, the property case involving Michelle Thomson first surfaced. She was accused of being involved in potentially unethical and fraudulent transactions in her capacity as a director of a property company. 2. The allegations centered around a series of property transactions between 2010 and 2011, where Thomson's company allegedly made rapid purchases and sales of properties at artificially inflated prices, allowing them to profit at the expense of the original owners. Such activities were claimed to potentially involve mortgage fraud. 3. These events led to the suspension of Michelle Thomson's membership in the SNP as well as the resignation of her legal advisor, Christopher Hales, after he was deemed unfit to practice law. The Investigation: 4. The Scottish Crown began its investigation into the alleged fraud case in 2014, following the allegations and legal implications surrounding the transactions. Michelle Thomson, along with several co-accused parties, faced intense scrutiny as the focus of the investigation. 5. The process of gathering evidence involved interviews, examining transaction records, and building a case around the potentially illegal activities carried out by Thomson and her associates. The Decision to Drop the Case: 6. After years of thorough investigation, the Scottish Crown has arrived at the decision to drop the fraud case against Michelle Thomson, citing a lack of sufficient evidence to prosecute. 7. This decision illustrates the challenges faced by prosecutors when trying to accumulate tangible evidence and formulate strong legal arguments, particularly in cases where financial transactions and alleged unlawful activities have taken place years prior. 8. Given the absence of substantial evidence, it becomes impossible to hold Thomson accountable for the allegations she faced, thus leading to the dismissal of the case. Conclusion: The dismissal of the fraud case against former SNP MP Michelle Thomson marks the end of years-long legal proceedings and investigations. With the insufficiency of evidence rendering any potential prosecution invalid, Thomson will no longer face the allegations in court. While such cases emphasize the importance of thorough and efficient investigations, they also highlight the challenges prosecutors face in building a strong legal case against individuals accused of financial misconduct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(AOL Autos) -- With car companies going in into bankruptcy and shedding famous names left and right, it's important to remember that today's automotive titans started out as tiny startups, not unlike Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. General Motors was almost called International Motors Co. Names like Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota and Porsche call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today. But behind every brand name, there is a flesh-and-blood inventor, entrepreneur or industrialist. Most of the time, they gave their name to the companies. And that fame was often about all they ended up with. David Buick, who invented the overhead valve engine, founded the Buick Motor Car Co. in 1903. William C. Durant, the industrialist who would eventually found GM, took over the company in 1904, when it ran into financial trouble. Buick stayed on as a director, but left in 1908, never making much money from the enterprise. He reportedly died in 1929, unable to afford one of his cars. Durant kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car, even though he worried that people might pronounce it \\"Boo-ick,\\" according to one author. Strangely enough, the man who practically created General Motors single-handedly never really liked the idea of a 'Durant' car. In another example, Robert Hupp invented the Hupmobile,'a two-seat runabout, in 1908. But he sold his stock in his Hupp Motor Car Company in 1911. He turned around and founded the Hupp Corp. that same year. Investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the \\"Hupp\\" from his new company's name and they won. His own automotive glory quickly faded, although the Hupmobile survived until the 1940s. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. What company was almost call International Motors? 2. Who invented the overhead valve engine? 3. What company did he found? 4. Who took over the company? 5. When did this happen? 6.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the Reserve that was renamed the Cascade National Forest in 1907? The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Frémont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.

Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned that encrypted messaging apps could be used by criminals and terrorists. But security experts say strong encryption protects citizens' privacy. Many countries, including Australia, have laws in place that can force messaging services to hand over a suspect's communications to police with an appropriate warrant. However, messaging companies cannot hand over messages that have been end-to-end encrypted because they do not receive a legible copy. This encryption means ordinary citizens' messages cannot be intercepted by criminals or spies as they travel across the internet. But some people worry that terrorists and criminals can communicate secretly this way. \\"I think most people agree that there is a problem,\\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University. \\"The trouble is trying to force companies to decrypt via legislation is the very reason end-to-end encryption was introduced - particularly by US-based firms post-Snowden - to give their global customer base confidence that no government could get them to do what the Australians now propose.\\" Mr Turnbull said encryption meant online messages were \\"effectively dark to the reach of the law\\", which he said was \\"not acceptable\\". He said companies had to \\"assist the rule of law\\" and provide law enforcement with access to encrypted messages. \\"For this to work, the companies will have to change their technical architecture or somehow weaken the encryption,\\" said Prof Woodward. \\"Either is a bad idea.\\" Some politicians have called for apps to build a \\"back door\\" into their systems, to allow law enforcement access to unencrypted messages. But such a system could also be exploited by criminals, defeating the purpose of encryption. Mr Turnbull said he was not seeking a \\"back door\\" and wanted communications handed over in \\"the usual way that applies in the offline world\\". Prof Woodward said modern encryption methods had not been cracked. But Mr Turnbull said Australian law would prevail over the laws of mathematics. He told journalists: \\"The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\\"","completion":"The debate over end-to-end encryption of messaging apps, like WhatsApp, revolves around privacy and security. End-to-end encryption is a system wherein only the communicating users can read the messages. In theory, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including telecom providers, Internet providers, and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation. This feature enhances the privacy of users but presents a challenge for authorities when it comes to terror investigations and criminality. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commented on the issue, stating his concern that encrypted messaging apps could serve as tools for criminal and terrorist activities. Therefore, he believes it is intolerable for these encrypted communications to remain beyond the reach of the law. Despite this, numerous security experts argue that strong encryption is vital for protecting citizens' privacy. They believe any attempt to create \\"back doors,\\" or methods allowing law enforcement authorities to bypass encryption and access the contents of communications, would undermine the security of all users, as criminals could also potentially exploit these methods. Current laws in many countries, including Australia, can compel messaging services to provide a suspect's communications if an appropriate warrant is obtained. However, this has limitations as companies cannot provide messages that have been end-to-end encrypted, given they are unable to obtain a legible copy. Herein lies the conflict between the desire for security and the protection of privacy. Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University, noted the complexity of the situation. He pointed out that forcing companies to decrypt messages through legislation would essentially defeat the purpose of introducing end-to-end encryption, which arose primarily to instill confidence in a global customer base post-Snowden that no government could force a company to do what the Australians are proposing. Turnbull insists that even though he respects the laws of mathematics, the Australian law must be prominent. While he does not demand a 'back door' into these systems, he expects companies to cooperate with authorities and allow access to encrypted messages in order to uphold the rule of law. This task, however, would require changes in the technical architecture or a weakening of the encryption, both of which are deemed unsuitable solutions by Prof. Woodward due to their potential risk and the resultant compromise on privacy and data security. On the whole, the conversation around encryption highlights the struggle between ensuring national security and preserving individual privacy rights in our increasingly digital world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Feminism and Success of Saudi TV Show 'Sponsored Women' At first glance, the four stars of a new Saudi television drama, “Mubta’ethat” or “Sponsored Women,” look a little mis-matched. There’s Salma, a chic tomboy with short hair and red lipstick, Raghad, a glam-girl with confident strides and princess curls, Sara, a feisty hijabi with colorful clothing, and Alia, a cautious girl who wears a black niqab (covering of the hair and entire face, with only slits for the eyes). But they have one thing in common: They’ve each got a U.S. visa page in their green passport. It is their golden ticket to leave their homes in Saudi Arabia to pursue an education in Philadelphia. The show highlights how these Saudi women fluidly adapt to a Western world while maintaining their Eastern ideals. They enroll in English classes, move into their own apartments and learn how to drive a car. They all steer their own lives for the first time. The script plays with the obvious contrasts inherent in the plot–the girls are almost as different from each other as their culture is from the one they’ll encounter in the United States. It manages to also dig into stereotypes about America or women in veils. During the 30 episodes, the women are forced to identify with each other and confront their own biases. Their friendship can be compared to that of a certain all-female cult HBO show from the 90s. The now classic formula of bringing together very different girls with strong personalities and courageous adventures still works. This time, with a Saudi accent. The program debuted on June 17, the first day of Ramadan, and was broadcast in Saudi Arabia every night through the Holy month which ended in mid-July. The show enjoyed a steady viewership over the course of the month. Each night, the episode would be uploaded on YouTube after it airs, and the comment section would quickly populate. “These girls don’t represent any Saudi girl I know and I’m a sponsored student,” reads a comment. “This is an amazing series, can’t wait for the next episode,” reads another. The positive reviews seem to outweigh the negative ones. Since it is broadcast during the Holy Month, this revolutionary show is representing millennials in a way that Saudi TV hasn’t otherwise seen. The show has an impressive pedigree: Directed by Oscar-nominated Saudi superstar, Haifaa Al Mansour and written by her sister, Noura Al Mansour, it was produced by Rotana Khalejia, a company that is partially owned by Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal. The characters are from key parts of Saudi and represent different lifestyles and social temperaments. Surely, young girls in Saudi can identify with qualities found in every one of these women. Salma is from the liberal West Coast, Raghad is from the luxurious capital, Sara is from the moderate East Coast and Alia is originally from conservative Al Qassim. Each family reacts differently to the departure of their daughter to the faraway continent. And while each girl has at least one family member closely watching over them in Philadelphia, letting go is still nerve wrecking for the families. In one comical scene, Alia’s mother is seen stealthily stuffing stacks of (imported) ramen noodles and sacks of rice into her daughter’s luggage before departing from Saudi. “They have that food in America!” her frustrated husband protests. “No! It’s laced with drugs there!” the exasperated mother replies. They are nervous about sending their only child, a daughter, to the unknown. “It smells like freedom! Of course, it tastes like nicotine,” Salma, says on the phone, as she cautiously drags a puff from a cigarette upon arrival to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Despite being a few continents away, she maintains the Saudi fear of being seen smoking in public. Actress Noor Al Badr who plays Salma, is a doctor in real life. She got “the randomest call” from Al Mansour who asked her to join the cast. Five days later, Al Badr was on the plane to Bahrain, where they shot most of the show. “Of course, most people thought I was crazy. I was a doctor! According to most people in our society, acting is not something to be proud of. I think I’m the first Saudi girl to smoke on TV. I wanted to break the taboo,” Al Badr said. No Saudi feminist show would be complete without the subject of the hijab. The irony is not lost on the characters. Two of the characters don’t cover their hair and two do. In one scene, Salma says of Alia, “She can see everyone but nobody can see her.” Alia, played by actress Zara Albaloshi, repeats how her covering is the ultimate feminist statement. Perhaps most surprising of all, Alia falls in love with a non-Muslim American, Jason, who lives in her building. He becomes interested in Islam and converts. By the end of the series, Alia, the girl who only reveals her eyes to the world, gives her heart to Jason. The show’s U.S. location is also telling: Philadelphia is central to the American Dream. It is where the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. The women are in the U.S. on an academic scholarship, called the Saudi Scholarship. They are “sponsored,” hence the title of the show. Saudi Arabia has been funding Saudi students in the U.S. since 1960, but the late King Abdullah’s Scholarship Program, which launched a decade ago, was the largest push in encouraging female citizens to study abroad. In just five decades, Saudi girls went from not knowing how to read or write to a 97 percent literacy rate, according to UNICEF. Although the image of Saudi women has changed over the generations, the outdated impressions haven’t yet caught up with reality. The show makes a point of addressing these issues. “With 150,000 men and women studying abroad, why is Saudi considered to be a ‘developing country?’ In reality, it is quite developed,” Sara, played by actress Maram Abdulaziz, asks her classmates in one scene. Actress Noura Assar’s character, Raghad, has her camera at the ready to document the trials and triumphs of her Saudi female friends. An aspiring actress and director, Raghad’s quiet rebellion comes in the form of selecting that area of study. There is no such industry in Saudi Arabia today. Assar thinks the show is starting a different conversation. “I am proud to say that the image of Saudi women has come a long way from what it used to be; strong Saudi women always existed, however, the image was very much attached to a certain stereotype. The scholarships, I’d say, participated in this change due to the ‘face to face’ method of dealing with others, where people in other countries saw for themselves what these ladies can achieve and become,” she said. “Just because we can’t drive doesn’t mean we can’t fly and reach for the stars. Hope the show will continue next Ramadan!” Al Badr said. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"\\"Sponsored Women\\" is a Saudi TV show about four different girls from Saudi Arabia who get the chance to travel to the United States to study in Philadelphia.

The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next.People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets.But most.instead, worked as railroad laborers.They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare .

Meeting Expectations: The reviewer states that this specific set \\"did not disappoint like the rest of them.\\" This implies that the other Giggle and go sets were successful and enjoyable for the reviewer's child, and the current product under review generated a similar positive outcome. This further strengthens the trust in the product and the brand. 3. Cost: The reviewer mentions that they paid around 20 for the set and felt that it was a reasonable price. This not only indicates their satisfaction with the purchase but also gives a potential buyer an idea of the price range. A buyer who finds the cost within their budget can then feel confident that the product offers good value for money, as implied by the reviewer's opinion. 4. Implicit Recommendation: Although the reviewer doesn't explicitly recommend the product, the use of positive language and emphasis on satisfaction with the experience suggests an implicit recommendation. This creates a positive perception of the product and can play a role in influencing potential buyers to consider purchasing it. In conclusion, this review increases the chances of me buying the Giggle and go set due to the reviewer's positive past experiences with the brand, the product meeting their expectations, the reasonable price, and the implied recommendation. The overall satisfied tone of the review assures me that the product will likely offer a similarly positive experience for my own child."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Billy loved climbing, and he eventually suffered a brain injury due to what? Options: - getting higher - loss of oxygen - falling - blisters - ascending Explain why a human would choose \\"loss of oxygen\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"loss of oxygen\\" A human would choose \\"loss of oxygen\\" as the answer to this question for several reasons: 1. Plausibility: Among the given options, \\"loss of oxygen\\" is more plausible as a cause of brain injury. Climbing at high altitudes can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels, which can affect the brain and lead to injury. 2. Relation to climbing: \\"Loss of oxygen\\" is directly related to the activity of climbing, especially when climbing at high altitudes. As the altitude increases, the air becomes thinner and there is less oxygen available. This can cause harm to those who are not acclimatized or prepared for such conditions. 3. Elimination of other options: The other options provided are either less likely to cause a brain injury or are not directly related to climbing as a cause. - \\"Getting higher\\": While this option could be related to the activity of climbing, it is vague and doesn't specifically mention a reason for the brain injury. - \\"Falling\\": While falls can cause brain injuries, the question specifically asks about the \\"eventual\\" cause. In this context, it implies that the injury comes from a cumulative effect of climbing, rather than a single fall. - \\"Blisters\\": Blisters are a common occurrence during climbing, but they typically affect the feet and hands, not the brain. As a result, blisters are not a plausible cause for a brain injury. - \\"Ascending\\": This option is somewhat similar to \\"getting higher\\" and doesn't specify any particular reason for the brain injury. It's simply a description of the act of climbing, not a cause itself. Given these considerations, a human would choose \\"loss of oxygen\\" to answer the question as it is the most plausible and directly related option among the choices provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She's a 46-year-old mother of three wonderful kids. One day, 11 years ago, Lisa went to see the doctor because she wasn't feeling well. The doctor took some tests and they found out that Lisa had a sickness called acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and is not fun to have. To help Lisa get better, the doctors decided that she needed something called a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow is a squishy and important stuff found inside our bones. It helps our bodies make blood cells, like the ones Lisa's body wasn't making the right way. Now, they needed to find someone who had the same kind of bone marrow to give to Lisa, kind of like sharing a toy with a friend who needs it. In a faraway place, a kind man named Neil Munro saw an advert (like a poster) asking for help to find someone with the right bone marrow. Neil thought he could be that person, so he went ahead and got tested. Guess what? Neil was a perfect match for Lisa! So, Neil shared his bone marrow with Lisa, and after a successful transplant, Lisa started to feel much better. Now she could be healthy and happy with her kids again. Years passed, and one day, Lisa found Neil's contact information and they started talking to each other. They wanted to finally meet in person and thank each other for their kindness. So, Lisa and Neil, along with their families, got together for a lovely reunion. They have now become friends who keep in touch regularly, like pen pals exchanging letters.

A lo largo de la historia, Grecia ha tenido una gran importancia en el desarrollo de la cultura, la filosofía, la democracia y las artes. Sin embargo, en los últimos años, ha enfrentado numerosas dificultades económicas y políticas, lo que ha provocado una situación de desesperación y resignación en la población. Desde el inicio de la crisis económica mundial en 2008, Grecia ha experimentado una recesión profunda que ha llevado a un aumento significativo en los niveles de desempleo, la pobreza y la deuda pública. A pesar de los esfuerzos del gobierno griego y la ayuda financiera proporcionada por la Unión Europea y el Fondo Monetario Internacional, el país sigue enfrentando serias dificultades para recuperarse y crecer económicamente. Ante esta situación, muchos ciudadanos griegos se sienten desesperados y resignados. La desesperación proviene de la falta de oportunidades laborales, el estancamiento de la economía y la incertidumbre sobre el futuro. La resignación, por otro lado, es resultado de la percepción de que, a pesar de los esfuerzos realizados, la situación no parece mejorar y las soluciones a los problemas económicos y políticos parecen estar fuera de su alcance. Además, la situación en Grecia ha llevado a un aumento en la emigración, principalmente de jóvenes altamente educados en busca de mejores oportunidades en otros países europeos. Esto ha generado preocupación acerca de la llamada \\"fuga de cerebros\\" y el potencial impacto negativo a largo plazo en el desarrollo económico y social del país. A pesar de la desesperación y resignación, Grecia sigue siendo un país con una rica historia y cultura y cuenta con un gran potencial para superar sus desafíos.

Ask a question about List of numbered streets in Manhattan.","completion":"What is the significance of the list of numbered streets in Manhattan, and how did they become an essential aspect of the urban layout and navigation system within New York City? The list of numbered streets in Manhattan is an essential part of the urban layout and navigation system within New York City. Dating back to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, these systematically numbered streets played a significant role in organizing and shaping the growth of Manhattan by establishing a gridiron network of streets and avenues stretching from Houston Street in the south to 155th Street in the north. The origin of this systematic arrangement can be attributed to the Commissioner's Plan of 1811, which outlined a visionary and ambitious design to accommodate and foster Manhattan's rapid population growth and urban development. The key architects behind this design were John Randel Jr., a surveyor, and the Commissioners, Gouverneur Morris, Simeon De Witt, and John Rutherfurd, who were appointed by the New York State Legislature to develop the layout. The numbered streets run east-west across Manhattan, starting with 1st Street in the East Village and ascending northward to 220th Street in Inwood. These streets intersect the north-south avenues, which are also numbered but follow a separate numbering system that starts with 1st Avenue on the east side of Manhattan and runs up to 12th Avenue on the west side. This organized grid system was adopted to make it easier for residents and visitors to navigate the city and find locations by using simple street and avenue numbers. The numbered streets also facilitated urban development, allowing for the orderly construction of buildings, parks, and other infrastructure elements. Moreover, the numbered streets have played an essential role in preserving Manhattan's historical identity. Most of the original streets and avenues from the 1811 plan remain part of the city's street network. For instance, Broadway retains its unique diagonal path, which predates the grid, and Central Park lies between 59th and 110th Streets, conspicuously disrupting the numbered streets' continuity. In addition to serving practical navigation and urban planning purposes, the Manhattan numbered streets also contribute to the city's vibrant cultural scene. Many street names are synonymous with the neighborhoods they cross and the landmarks they encompass. For example, 42nd Street is home to iconic tourist spots like Times Square, the Theater District, and New York Public Library, while 34th Street features popular shopping destinations like Macy's Herald Square department store. In conclusion, the list of numbered streets in Manhattan is a vital aspect of the city's urban layout and navigation system. Originating from the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, these systematically organized streets and avenues have effectively accommodated New York City's exponential growth and development over the past two centuries, while also preserving its historical essence and contributing to its rich cultural tapestry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Emily Allen PUBLISHED: 10:37 EST, 11 July 2012 | UPDATED: 12:32 EST, 11 July 2012 An executive fighting a £300,000 battle to make insurers pay up for a fire that gutted his home has denied that his boyfriend started the blaze while having a 'hissy fit.' Jonathan Smyth returned home from work on the evening of Tuesday, January 22 2008, to find his house in Margaret Street, Brighton, ablaze with police and firefighters in attendance. The fire, which started in a basement bedroom, made the £350,000 house uninhabitable and caused huge damage to the contents - as well as killing three pet cats. However, Mr OPTIONS: - Brighton denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Emily Allen denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Howe denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Jonathan Smyth denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Margaret Street denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Tony Bear denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. - Tony Howe denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire.","completion":"- Jonathan Smyth denies any involvement, accidental or deliberate, in the starting of the fire. Emily Allen is the author of the news story, so it would be illogical for her to be directly involved in the incident. Brighton is a location, and Margaret Street is the street name where the house was located, so neither of those can be relevant to denying any involvement, as they are geographical references, not individuals. Tony Bear is not mentioned in the text and has no connection to the story provided, so it doesn't make sense as a completion. Though Tony Howe is not directly mentioned in the text, he is the likely boyfriend referenced in the beginning.

Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished. Hint: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. Answer:","completion":"Bank island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce. This is because Bank island experienced severe drought, which caused a diminished food supply. Birds with smaller beaks could only eat the smaller seeds, while birds with bigger beaks could eat seeds of all sizes. Due to the limited food supply, many small-beaked birds died during the drought, and as a result, the birds with bigger beaks were more likely to survive and reproduce. This led to an increase in the average beak size within the finch population on Bank island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Given the background: Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases. and the situation: Brian has two identical containers of the same gas sitting on his kitchen table. He has a device that allows him to increase the pressure of any container he wants. He brings the device up to container B but decides not to use it. He then goes over to container A and activates the device to increase the pressure. Answer the following question: Which container's gas has more volume? Answer:","completion":"Container B's gas has more volume. Since Brian increased the pressure in container A and according to Boyle's law, the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant, the volume of gas in container A would decrease. Therefore, container B would have a greater volume of gas as its pressure remains unchanged."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The layers of exposed rock on either side of the river will still match up. Look at the Grand Canyon in Figure 2.27. Its a good example of lateral continuity. You can clearly see the same rock layers on opposite sides of the canyon. The matching rock layers were deposited at the same time. They are the same age. Question: \\"When rocks are forced up above the water as Earth plates move what may eventually happen?\\" Response: \\"rivers will erode the rock away\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Possible answers: [A]. no. [B]. yes.","completion":"[B]. yes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. President-elect Barack Obama and his foreign policy advisers and speechwriters are wrestling with one of the most important speeches of his presidency, his inaugural address. One of their toughest conceptual challenges is how to describe and recast what the Bush administration has consistently termed the \\"war on terror.\\" The dean of military strategists, Carl von Clausewitz, explains the importance of this decision-making in his treatise \\"On War\\": \\"The first, the supreme, the most decisive act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish...the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into something that is alien to its nature.\\" Clausewitz's excellent advice about the absolute necessity of properly defining the war upon which a nation is about to embark was ignored by Bush administration officials who instead declared an open-ended and ambiguous \\"war on terror\\" after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. Bush took the nation to war against a tactic, rather than a war against a specific enemy, which was obviously al Qaeda and anyone allied to it. When the United States went to war against the Nazis and the Japanese during World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt and his congressional supporters did not declare war against U-boats and kamikaze pilots, but on the Nazi state and Imperial Japan. The war on terror, sometimes known as the \\"Global War on Terror\\" or by the clunky acronym GWOT, became the lens through which the Bush administration judged almost all of its foreign policy decisions. That proved to be dangerously counterproductive on several levels. The GWOT framework propelled the Bush administration into its disastrous entanglement in Iraq. It had nothing to do with 9/11 but was launched under the rubric of the war on terror and the erroneous claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The theory was that he might give such weapons to terrorists, including al Qaeda to whom he was supposedly allied, and that he therefore threatened American interests. None of this, of course, turned out to be true. The Bush administration's approach to the war on terror collided badly with another of its doctrines, spreading democracy in the Middle East as a panacea to reduce radicalism. It pushed for elections in the Palestinian territories in which, in early 2006, the more radical Hamas won a resounding victory, propelled to power on a wave of popular revulsion for the incompetence and corruption of the Fatah party that had dominated Palestinian politics since the 1960s. Imprisoned by its war on terror framework, the Bush administration supported Israel in a disastrous war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. Hezbollah is not only a terrorist group but is also part of the rickety Lebanese government and runs social welfare services across the country, yet for the Bush administration its involvement in terrorism was all that mattered. As is now widely understood in Israel, the war against Hezbollah was a moral and tactical defeat for the Israeli military and government. Events in the current Israeli incursion in Gaza will determine whether history repeats itself. Under the banner of the war on terror, the Bush administration also tied itself in conceptual knots conflating the threat from al Qaeda with Shiite groups like Hezbollah and the ayatollahs in Iran. In 2006, for instance, President Bush claimed that \\"the Sunni and Shiite extremist represent different faces of the same threat.\\" In reality, Sunni and Shiite extremists have been killing each other in large numbers for years in countries from Pakistan to Iraq. The groups have differing attitudes toward the United States, which Sunni extremists attacked in 1993 and again on 9/11, while Shiite militants have never done so. So, how to reconceptualize the GWOT? Contrary to a common view among Europeans, who have lived through the bombing campaigns of various nationalist and leftist terror groups for decades, al Qaeda is not just another criminal/terrorist group that can be dealt with by police action and law enforcement alone. After all, a terrorist organization like the Irish Republican Army would call in warnings before its attacks and its single largest massacre killed 29 people. By contrast, al Qaeda has declared war on the United States repeatedly -- as it did for the first time to a Western audience during Osama bin Laden's 1997 interview with CNN. Following that declaration of war, the terror group attacked American embassies, a U.S. warship, the Pentagon and the financial heart of the United States, killing thousands of civilians without warning; acts of war by any standard. Al Qaeda is obviously at war with the United States and so to respond by simply recasting the GWOT as the GPAT, the Global Police Action Against Terrorists, would be foolish and dangerous. What kind of war then should the United States fight against al Qaeda? For that we should learn some lessons from the conceptual errors of the Bush administration. Nine days after 9/11, Bush addressed Congress in a speech watched live by tens of millions of Americans in which he said that al Qaeda followed in the footsteps \\"of the murderous ideologies of the 20th century...They follow in the path of fascism, Nazism and totalitarianism,\\" implying that the fight against al Qaeda would be similar to World War II or the Cold War. For the Bush administration, painting the conflict in such existential terms had the benefit of casting the president as the heroic reincarnation of Winston Churchill and anyone who had the temerity to question him as the reincarnation of Hitler's arch-appeaser, Neville Chamberlain. But this portrayal of the war on terror was massively overwrought. The Nazis occupied and subjugated most of Europe and instigated a global conflict that killed tens of millions. And when the United States fought the Nazis, the country spent 40 percent of its gross domestic product to do so and fielded millions of soldiers. In his inaugural address, Obama should say that the United States is indeed at \\"war against al Qaeda and its allies,\\" but that as Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1933, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. If Americans are not terrorized by terrorists, then the U.S. has won against them. Al Qaeda and its allies are threats to the United States and Americans living and working overseas, but they are far from all-powerful. Barring an exceptional event like September 11, 2001, in any given year Americans are more likely to die of snake bites or lightning strikes than a terrorist attack. Despite the hyperventilating rhetoric of Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda's amateur investigations into weapons of mass destruction do not compare to the very real possibility of nuclear conflagration that we faced during the Cold War. There are relatively few adherents of Binladen-ism in the West today, while there were tens of millions of devotees of communism and fascism. Obama should also make it clear that instead of the Bush formulation of \\"Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,\\" the Obama administration doctrine will be, \\"Anyone who is against the terrorists is with us.\\" After all it is only al Qaeda and its several affiliates in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Algeria and allied groups such as the Taliban that kill U.S. soldiers and civilians and attack American interests around the globe. Everyone else in the world is a potential or actual ally in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates, because those organizations threaten almost every category of institution, government and ethnic grouping.

But don't worry, I'll tell you the most important parts in a way that's easy to understand: 1. Barack Obama, who is about to become the President of the United States, and his team are trying to decide how to talk about something called the \\"war on terror.\\" That was a name used by the previous president, George W. Bush, to describe the fight against people who want to harm others and create fear, mainly a group called al Qaeda. 2. The story says that Bush's decision to call it a \\"war on terror\\" might not have been the best idea. He was treating it like a war against a specific way of doing harmful things, instead of a specific group of bad people. It's kind of like he was saying we're fighting against every way people could scare us, instead of against the people who are actually trying to scare us. 3. This approach led Bush's team to make a lot of important decisions about how to deal with other countries. Some of those decisions didn't work out very well, like going to war with Iraq, a country in the Middle East. 4. Now, Obama and his team need to figure out a better way to talk about and deal with this big problem. They want to make sure people understand that al Qaeda is a really dangerous group that wants to hurt Americans, but they also want to show that it's not as all-powerful or scary as some people might think. 5. Instead of saying, \\"you're either with us or against us,\\" as Bush did, Obama wants to say, \\"if you're against these bad guys, you're with us.\\" That means there are a lot of potential allies around the world who can help in the fight against al Qaeda and similar groups.

Here is a news article: CLOSE President Trump made an announcement from the White House, keeping his campaign promise, that the United States would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. John Fritze reports. John Fritze, USA TODAY President Trump arrives to participate in first lady Melania Trump's \\"Be Best\\" initiative launch event in the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday. (Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA-EFE) WASHINGTON – As he announced Tuesday that he would no longer abide by the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump sent a not-so-veiled message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \\"Today's action sends a critical message: The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them,\\" Trump said. Even as he spoke, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on his way to the Korean Peninsula to lay the groundwork for talks about North Korea's nuclear program. \\"Plans are being made; relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen,\\" Trump said. The very same issues that caused Trump to pull out of the Iran agreement will also be hurdles in North Korea talks — and in some cases, those hurdles will be higher. Unlike Iran, North Korea already has nuclear weapons. \\"Ripping up the Iran deal will demonstrate to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that a deal with the United States can't be counted on. And it will give Kim Jong Un less incentive to make important concessions,\\" said Robert Einhorn of the Brookings Institution, a former State Department adviser on arms control during the Obama administration. Einhorn said Trump's position on the Iran deal could box him in on negotiations with North Korea. On sanctions relief, human rights and missile technology, Trump may be setting a standard on Iran that could be impossible to reach on a North Korea deal. Trump has four major problems with the Iran deal, which was negotiated by President Obama and five other world powers and is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. More: What is the Iran nuclear deal? Key questions and answers about the deal and its future •The JCPOA didn't address Iran's ballistic missile program. •It didn't stop Iran's misbehavior in the Middle East. • Provisions of the agreement expire after 10 to 15 years. •It rewarded Iran by unfreezing its assets frozen by years of U.S. sanctions. Trump is moving quickly toward a historic summit with Kim in the coming weeks, bypassing the years of lower-level talks that preceded the Iran nuclear deal. \\"The location is picked — the time and the date, everything is picked,\\" Trump said. An Obama-era law requires Trump to make a decision on Iran sanctions every 120 days. The previous time he faced that deadline, Trump waived the sanctions. Tuesday, he signed a presidential memorandum to pull out of the agreement, allowing him to impose the sanctions. \\"They're not formally linked, but clearly, they’re linked in many people's minds. They're two rogue regimes on different parts of the timeline toward developing a nuclear program,\\" said Bruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst on North Korea now at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Because North Korea is further along on that timeline — it's suspected of having a nuclear stockpile of as many as 60 warheads — Iran and other potential nuclear states will watch to see what Kim can get away with. \\"The Trump administration has set a very high bar for success and painted itself into a corner through its very strong opposition — to not just the JCPOA but other agreements with North Korea,\\" Klingner said. An agreement in 1994 with North Korea, negotiated by the Clinton administration and known as the Agreed Framework, slowed North Korea's nuclear program for eight years. The pact collapsed during the George W. Bush administration — in part because of North Korean provocations, but the United States didn't live up to its promise to help North Korea develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \\"One would think that the U.S. pulling out of the Iran deal would undermine North Korea's perception that it could trust the U.S. to maintain any kind of agreement with it,\\" Klingner said. \\"The North Koreans already think that the U.S. political system is fickle. We change our policy every four to eight years.\\" That cuts both ways. Just as Iran learned that a U.S. president might not maintain an agreement his predecessor made, both countries may calculate that the next U.S. president might give them a better deal.

(Associated Press) TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — President Hassan Rouhani warned Tuesday that Iran could restart enriching uranium \\"without any limitations\\" within weeks, after President Donald Trump pulled America out of the nuclear deal, though he said world powers still in the accord could potentially save the pact. Rouhani's speech, broadcast live on state television within minutes of Trump's announcement, marked a doubling-down for the cleric who has seen his signature foreign policy achievement threatened by Trump for years. Trump's announcement from the White House marked potentially the worst-case scenario for the relative moderate, as the country's economy continues to reel despite the deal and may further worsen. Stressing that the accord remained a \\"multilateral\\" one, and not just with the U.S., Rouhani said he'd be sending Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the countries still in the deal — China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. Iran hopes the European Union will pass laws to protect European firms from any potential U.S. sanctions. EU officials have suggested they'll do what they can to salvage the agreement. Still, Rouhani made a point of stressing that Iran, at any time, could resume its nuclear program. \\"So if necessary, we can begin our industrial enrichment without any limitations,\\" the Iranian leader said. \\"Until implementation of this decision, we will wait for some weeks and will talk with our friends and allies and other signatories of the nuclear deal, who signed it and who will remain loyal to it. Everything depends on our national interests.\\" During the live broadcast, Rouhani also made a point of reeling off examples of American meddling in Iran, including the 1953 coup that deposed its elected prime minister and the U.S. Navy shooting down of an Iranian commercial airliner in 1988. Iranian state television did not broadcast Trump's announcement live, but carried his remarks in a crawl at the bottom of the screen and later recounted some of them. Earlier Tuesday, Rouhani had stressed that Iran wants to keep \\"working with the world and (pursue) constructive engagement with the world.\\" That appeared to be a nod to Europe, which has struck a series of business deals with Iran since signing the landmark 2015 nuclear accord. Trump and the United States also came under fire from Iran's first vice president, Eshaq Jahangiri, a popular reformist politician who has been suggested as a possible presidential contender in Iran's 2021 election. \\"Today, the biggest power in the world is yelling that it does not accept\\" the deal, Jahangiri said, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency. Only \\"naive individuals would accept to enter talks with such a country,\\" he added. \\"We are ready and have a plan for managing ... under any circumstance.\\" Jahangiri's comments suggest a potential political turn against any rapprochement with the West in response to the Trump pullout, especially as he is a reformist — a politician who advocates for change to Iran's theocratic government. It also comes as Trump is set to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later this year, where negotiations will undoubtedly include talks about that country's atomic weapons program. Iran's 2015 nuclear deal imposed restrictions on the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in return for the lifting of most of the U.S. and international sanctions against Tehran. However, the deal came with time limits and did not address Iran's ballistic missile program or its regional policies in Syria and elsewhere. Trump has repeatedly pointed to those omissions in referring to the accord as the \\"worst deal ever.\\" However, proponents have said those time limits were meant to encourage more discussion with Iran in the future that could eventually address other concerns. Many in Tehran and elsewhere in the country are worried about what Trump's decision could mean for Iran. Already, the Iranian rial is trading on the black market at 66,000 to the dollar, despite a government-set rate of 42,000 rials. And many say they have not seen any benefits from the nuclear deal. Iran's poor economy and unemployment sparked nationwide protests in December and January that saw at least 25 people killed and, reportedly, nearly 5,000 arrested. Still some hard-line Iranian politicians welcomed the U.S. pullout. \\"The U.S. pullout from the deal is the best achievement for Iran since it shows the real face of the U.S.,\\" said hard-line lawmaker Ahmad Alirzabeigi. \\"We should not rely on the U.S., nor on Europe.\\" \\"We will face hard sanctions following the U.S. pullout, but they will not remain in place since the global community needs Iran,\\" added another hard-line lawmaker, Jabbar Kouchakinejad. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report. ___ AP coverage on the Iran nuclear deal: https://apnews.com/tag/Irannuclear . ||||| President Trump has been criticized for lacking even a shred of cohesion in his decision making, but there has been one unifying theme over his first 15 months in office: torching the legacy of Barack Obama. The latest of his predecessor's accomplishments set for incineration is the Iran deal, which Trump announced plans to abandon today. The withdrawal comes after months of campaigning from experts, administration officials and the international community to preserve the deal, which Trump has been decrying as \\"one of the worst\\" ever since the 2016 campaign. The president wasn't swayed, remaining convinced he can renegotiate a better arrangement despite Iran's refusal to do so. Related What's Lurking Inside Trump's War Cabinet? With Mike Pompeo and John Bolton whispering in Trump’s ear, we are one step closer to war While announcing the United States' removal from the \\"decaying and rotten\\" agreement Tuesday afternoon, Trump said it's \\"fine\\" that Iran is refusing to negotiate a new deal, and that he will be ready to talk when the nation does decide to discuss new terms. In the meantime, Trump says he will work to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and that if the regime resumes its development of a weapons program, \\"it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.\\" He continued: Today’s action sends a critical message ... the U.S. no longer sends empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them.\\" Negotiated in July 2015, the deal, officially dubbed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, stipulated that Iran rid itself of nuclear fuel if the United States waived sanctions that had been crippling the nation's economy. As part of the deal, a UN nuclear agency would monitor Iran’s fidelity to the agreement and, thus far, the agency has determined that Iran has complied. After 10 years, restrictions on research and development would lighten, and after 15 years, Iran would be able to produce nuclear fuel, but not in service of a weapons program. Along with the lack of a provision preventing Iran from testing ballistic missiles, this \\"sunset clause\\" has been pointed to by Trump as one of the principle reasons the deal is a \\"disaster.\\" Most supporters of the deal have acknowledged its flaws, but have advocated working to amend the terms rather that starting from scratch. Trump's insistence on blowing the deal up may prove problematic, though, as Iran has stated that it is not willing to start negotiating an entirely new deal. This leaves the United States with no agreement, and leaves the rest of the world – the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China all signed onto the deal, as well – fearing the worst. \\"We would open the Pandora’s box,\\" French President Emmanuel Macron recently told German paper Der Spiegel of the impact of the U.S. pulling out of the deal. \\"There could be war.\\" Here are three immediate takeaways from Trump's decision today. 1. Iran is now free to build a nuclear bomb Since the deal took effect in October 2015, the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has kept close tabs on the degree to which Iran has upheld its promise to suspend its nuclear weapons program. The nation's former uranium enrichment plants are monitored constantly, dust samples are collected that are then analyzed for traces of nuclear activity and tips are investigated as to sites of suspicious activity within Iran. This element of oversight was a lynchpin of the agreement, as it has ensured there is virtually no way for Iran to even begin developing a nuclear weapon. Secretary of Defense James Mattis has called the verification process \\"robust.\\" The IAEA offers an unprecedented degree of transparency into the Iran's nuclear capabilities, an invaluable safeguard considering Iran's history as an untrustworthy adversary. With this safeguard removed, Iran would be free to renew its nuclear weapons program, and the United States would have no way of monitoring whether they are developing weapons. As some have pointed out, this could pave the way for an invasion. The Iran deal provides substantially more provision for verification of denuclearization & ongoing monitoring of such than will exist in this new post-Iran-deal reality. Watch arguments for war in the coming months take the shape of \\"we can't be sure Iran isn't building a bomb.\\" — Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) May 8, 2018 Part of what has emboldened Trump to renege is the departures of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster – who both encouraged the president to uphold the deal – with Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, respectively, who have both been critical of it. Bolton was involved in an eerily similar situation 15 years ago before the United States invaded Iraq. 15 years ago, Bolton + Netanyahu justified their demand for a confrontation with Iraq by claiming the weapons inspectors there were being duped. Now they're peddling the same story about the inspections in Iran. Why can't America learn from its mistakes?https://t.co/JraoV4kb4c pic.twitter.com/gNHHzywuB5 — Peter Beinart (@PeterBeinart) May 8, 2018 Iran’s capability to build a bomb would also incentivize other Middle Eastern nations to pursue nuclear weapons programs. \\"What has been gained from the nuclear deal? Imagine all the mutually contaminating civil wars and internecine conflicts that rage across the Middle East today. Then turn the dial and add the possibility of a regional nuclear arms race triggered by Iran dashing for a bomb,\\" wrote British foreign secretary Boris Johnson in a recent op-ed for the New York Times. \\"That is the scenario which the agreement has helped to prevent.\\" 2. Trump's decision will likely alienate allies Though brokered by the Obama administration, the Iran deal is very much an international accord, and the implications of Trump's refusal to waive sanctions on Iran come the May 12th deadline will be wide-ranging. In recent weeks, representatives from the United Kingdom, France and Germany have all visited the U.S. in an effort to convince Trump to preserve the deal, acknowledging its flaws but pleading with the president to consider working to fix or amend the agreement rather than dissolving it entirely. Boris Johnson even attempted to appeal to Trump by saying that a Nobel Peace Prize could be a possibility if the president were able to fix the Iran deal and negotiate something similar with North Korea. France, Germany, and the UK regret the U.S. decision to leave the JCPOA. The nuclear non-proliferation regime is at stake. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 8, 2018 Though Trump has removed the United States from the deal, allies in Europe have committed to upholding it, and the reinstatement of sanctions may result in tension between the U.S. and those it relies on most. It could also cause a rift with China and Russia, who have also encouraged the United States to remain in the deal, warning of the geopolitical insecurity that would ensue should the deal be scrapped. As was the case when Trump removed the United States from the Paris Accords last summer, scrapping the Iran deal would be a significant blow to its standing as an international leader. 3. The abandonment may hinder an impending deal with North Korea Reimposing sanctions on Iran would be Trump’s most consequential foreign policy maneuver yet, but a meeting with Kim Jong-un looms large. For Trump to pull out of a deal that by all accounts, Iran is complying with, it could make North Korea wary of entering into a similar deal with the United States. \\"North Korea could not claim the U.S. abrogates agreements without cause and would be more likely to negotiate and end to its nuclear program,\\" wrote the National Coalition to Prevent an Iranian Nuclear Weapon, a bipartisan collection of over 100 national security veterans, a in a letter published last month. \\"Efforts to limit nuclear proliferation would be strengthened.\\" Trump has used every superlative in the book in criticizing the Iran deal. If he wants to broker an agreement that would result in the denuclearization of North Korea, he’s going to have to devise something even more advantageous for the U.S. than the Iran deal that North Korea will also agree to. This seems far fetched, to say the least. \\"The man who wrote The Art of the Deal has staked out a position that the Iran deal was the worst one in history,\\" Robert S. Litwak, author of Preventing North Korea's Nuclear Breakout recently explain to the New York Times. \\"And now he has to show that he can do much better, with a far harder case.\\" Trump ran on his dealmaking prowess, but there have been few examples of it through his first 15 months in office. Hopefully, for the sake of humanity, he's just been saving up all his negotiating acumen for his upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. He's going to need it. Along with his Tuesday afternoon announcement that the United States would remove itself from the Iran deal, Trump told the nation that newly minted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on his way to North Korea to work on the terms for the president's upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. \\"Plans are being made, relationships are building, and hopefully a deal will happen,\\" Trump said. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"President Trump has announced that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was negotiated by Obama administration and five other world powers.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Red State Movie plot: On the way to school, Travis (Michael Angarano) notices members of the Five Points Church (a thinly veiled version of the Kansas hate-mongering Wellsboro Baptist Church), led by Abin Cooper (Michael Parks), a middle-aged David Koresh-esq leader, protesting the funeral of a local gay teenager who was found murdered; the third hate crime murder in a month. During Travis's first class, his teacher talks about how Cooper and his church had their town ridiculed for his racial actions and beliefs. Later, Jared (Kyle Gallner), a friend of Travis, reveals he received an invitation from a woman he met on a sex site for group sex with himself, Travis and Billy Ray (Nicholas Braun). They borrow Travis's parents' car and travel out into the country to meet with the woman.Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the vehicle of Sheriff Wynan (Stephen Root), while he was engaged in a homosexual affair in his car. Afraid, the boys drive off. Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete (Matt L. Jones) to go and look for the vehicle (but doesn't tell him about what he was doing out on the back road).Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the trailer of the woman who sent out the invitation, Sarah Cooper (Melissa Leo). She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Here, Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon/monologue before his warped followers about sin reeks in the world and that all evil must be eradicated before the end of the world comes which is their one-way ticket into Heaven. Cooper then identifies another captive, a homosexual young man they lured in through an internet chat room. They bind him to a cross using saran wrap and violently execute him with a revolver and drop him into a small crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together; thus revealing that the Five Points Church is responsible for all the hate...

Parte 5: Ser pacientes y comprometidos en el proceso El crecimiento espiritual es un viaje a largo plazo que puede incluir tanto desafíos como logros. Por lo tanto, es vital ser pacientes y comprometidos en nuestra relación con nuestro maestro espiritual.

Here is a goal: brick Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of obtaining a brick, there are two main ways to consider: 1. Purchase a brick: Step 1: Determine the type and size of the brick required based on your needs. Bricks can be made from various materials such as clay or concrete and come in different sizes. Step 2: Research local hardware stores or building supply stores that sell bricks. This can include large chain stores or local specialty stores. Step 3: Compare prices between different suppliers to find the most cost-effective option for your needs. Step 4: Visit the chosen store or place an online order for the brick, ensuring that the selected type and size match your requirements. Step 5: Pick up the brick from the store or wait for it to be delivered if ordered online. 2. Make a brick yourself: Step 1: Gather materials required to make a brick, such as clay or concrete mix. Additionally, gather other necessary supplies like a mold, water, and a mixing tool. Step 2: If using clay, knead and shape the clay into the desired brick size and shape. If using concrete, mix the concrete using water and a mixing tool following the manufacturer's instructions, and then pour the mixture into the brick mold. Step 3: Allow the clay or concrete to dry or cure. This could take a few hours to several days, depending on the type of material and environmental conditions. Step 4: Once the brick has dried or cured, carefully remove it from the mold, clean up any rough edges or excess material, and let it continue to dry if needed. In conclusion, choosing between these two options depends on factors such as time, cost, and personal preferences. If you need a brick quickly and have access to a store that sells them, purchasing might be the more efficient option. However, if you want to create a custom brick or have the time and materials to make one yourself, creating a brick could be a more satisfying and cost-effective solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Victoria wants to learn how to run apps on android so she asks Mary for an advice, because","completion":"Mary is known for her extensive knowledge of Android operating systems and applications. Mary has been an Android enthusiast for years, having learned the ins and outs of various Android versions, mobile devices, and how different apps work and interact with each other. Victoria knows that consulting with her friend would provide her with the best information to understand and operate Android apps successfully. Mary is happy to help Victoria and begins by explaining the basics of Android applications. She tells Victoria that there are two primary ways to install and run apps on an Android device: through Google Play Store and by sideloading apps from external sources. First, Mary explains the process of installing apps through the Google Play Store. She advises Victoria to follow these steps: 1. Locate and open the Google Play Store app on the Android device. The Play Store comes preinstalled in most Android devices and is the official marketplace for downloading and updating apps. 2. Sign in using a Google account. For those who don't have one, they can create a new account by registering with their email address. 3. Using the search bar at the top, search for the desired app or browse the various categories available in the store's home page. 4. After finding the app, tap on it to open its individual page with detailed information such as developer, description, and user reviews. 5. Click on the 'Install' button, and the app would start downloading and installing automatically. 6. Upon completion, the app can be launched from the device's app drawer or home screen. Next, Mary discusses sideloading apps from external sources. She explains that Android allows users to install apps from other sources outside the Google Play Store, but there could be potential risks involved, such as malware and security issues. However, if Victoria wishes to sideload apps, Mary suggests the following steps: 1. Enable 'Unknown sources' or 'Install unknown apps' in the device's settings. This option is under 'Security' or 'Apps & notifications' depending on the Android version and device. 2. Find a trusted source to download the desired app's APK file, which is the Android package file used for app installation. 3. Download the APK file to the Android device, making sure to verify the source's legitimacy to avoid potential risks. 4. Using a file manager app or the device's native file explorer, locate the downloaded APK file and tap on it. 5. Allow any permissions requested by the app installer, and the installation process should begin. 6. Once the installation is complete, the app could be launched similarly as apps installed from the Play Store. Mary also teaches Victoria about app updates and managing apps on her Android device. She informs her that: 1. Regularly updating apps is crucial, as updates often include security patches, bug fixes, and new features. 2. App permissions can be managed from the device's settings, enabling or denying access to different device functions. 3. Unused apps should be uninstalled to free space and maintain a clutter-free device. Victoria is grateful to Mary for her comprehensive advice and guidance on running apps on her Android device. With Mary's help, Victoria can now confidently navigate her way through the Android ecosystem and start enjoying the various apps available to enhance her smartphone experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: The Transylvanian city of Brasov is usually just a day trip from Bucharest. People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off. Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.) For the first half day, we wandered around whilst the skies were beautifully blue… …learned a lot of local history, admired the Hollywood style sign in the hills… …slipped into a couple of churches (not to mention dodged giggling kids racing around on miniature cars)… …some hidden, and some hidden in plain sight… …and admired the sign from our cosy hotel, as it lit up at twilight Our only full day dawned fairly murky for the most part, it was a Sunday so a lot of things were closed, so after hitting 20,000 steps and getting lost a few times in the less pretty corners of the city… Question: Who is the author? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"The author is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Love on the high seas: Where to get romantic on your next cruise Cruising is by nature a group experience, full of mixing, mingling and meeting new friends. But that doesn't mean it's totally devoid of romance. There's plenty of opportunities to affirm the bond between the two of you, strolling under the stars, staring into each other's eyes during a romantic dinner and otherwise experiencing the cruise ship scene from a perspective of amore. Here are some places on cruise ships where you can up the romance quotient. The smokestack: Smooching at night under the ship's smokestack is a time-honored tradition, but be careful not to get too frisky — there are security cameras watching. The karaoke bar/piano bar: What's more romantic than a serenade? Whether Metallica's Nothing Else Matters or Al Green's Let's Stay Together, show your love in song at the karaoke bar, such as those on Royal Caribbean and Crystal Cruises ships. If you can't sing, head to the piano bar and make a request of the piano player (Billy Joel tunes are particularly popular). The spa: Turn to mush with a side-by-side couple's massage. Two therapists do the rubbing and kneading. If you book your treatment in a spa villa, as available on some Princess Cruises and Disney Cruise Line ships, you may have opportunity to linger afterwards with a bubble bath for two. The promenade: During the day, passengers walk the outdoor deck area for exercise, play shuffleboard and otherwise enjoy the ocean breezes. At night, you can take a stroll arm in arm and look at the stars, often without anyone else in sight. Specialty bars: Snag a corner table and make a toast your love at the champagne bar, martini bar or wine bar. On Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Epic, Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway you can bundle up in a parka and rub your cold noses together in the Svedka Ice Bar, where the temperature is always 17 degrees. Dance clubs: Clubs and lounges give couples the chance to dance to live bands and DJs. Show your ballroom skills backed by a big band on Cunard, dance the night away to scratch-n-spin masters trained by DJ Irie on Carnival Cruise Lines or do salsa at Boleros on Royal Caribbean ships. If there's an outdoor party – as on warm-weather itineraries of Seabourn, SeaDream Yacht Club and Windstar Cruises ships – take advantage of the opportunity to swing together under the stars. Specialty restaurants: Small luxury ships such as those of Silversea and Seabourn will accommodate a request for a table for two in the main dining room. But on mainstream ships, the best way to assure your own table is to book a specialty restaurant for a romantic date night. You get the bonus of upgraded cuisine and a more intimate atmosphere (a fee will be involved). Your cabin: While tight interior accommodations can be endearing in a shabby chic kind of way, couples seeking a romantic getaway may want to splurge on a larger stateroom with views. Upgrade to a balcony or veranda cabin for a \\"private\\" (others may be able to see you) lounging spot. Book a cabin with a tub if you're a bath lover (splurge on a suite and you may get a Jacuzzi). Your balcony: If you book a balcony cabin, take full advantage of your very own ocean views by staying in your bathrobe and ordering room service breakfast or dinner, served outdoors. Lines including Regent and Oceania will even deliver your meal course by course. Private cabanas/spaces: On some ships there is a hidden hot tub or patch of deck that few passengers discover, so it pays to read the deck plans carefully when looking for places to be at least semi alone. You can assure a degree of privacy by heading to the adults-only sundeck (a fee may be involved). Lines including Princess, Holland America Line and Celebrity Cruises also have open-air cabanas available to rent at the pool or elsewhere – the perfect place to listen to the ocean as you romantically hide away. Summary:","completion":"Cruises offer various opportunities for couples to enjoy romantic moments together. Some of the most romantic spots on cruise ships include the smokestack for night smooching, the karaoke or piano bar for serenades, the spa for couple's massages, the promenade for stargazing strolls, specialty bars for toasting to love, dance clubs for dancing together, specialty restaurants for intimate dinners, cabins with balcony or veranda for private lounging, and private cabanas or spaces for secluded relaxation.

Google unveils new ‘Nexus 6′ smartphone, tablet and media player Google on Wednesday introduced a new lineup of gadgets showing off a new smartphone, tablet and streaming media player. The ambitious release takes on many of Google's top competitors ahead of the holiday season. The Nexus 6, made by Motorola, has a 6-inch screen that gives it a bigger profile than the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus that Apple introduced earlier this summer. The phone has a 13-inch megapixel camera and a battery life feature that will keep the phone running for six hours on just 15 minutes of charging time. The phone also has dual front-facing speakers that Google boasts will be good for watching video and playing games -- two of the fastest-growing uses for large-screen smartphones. AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular will carry the phone. It will be available for pre-order on Oct. 17 and hit store shelves on Nov. 3, the company said. The phone will cost 649 for a 32GB version and 699 for a 64 GB version. In the tablet space, Google also introduced the Nexus 9 by HTC. The tablet, which has an 8.9-inch screen, lands somewhere between the size of a full-sized iPad and an iPad mini. Google is marketing it not only as a recreational device, but also as a stand-in for users's laptops, offering a separate keyboard accessory -- for \\"real work,\\" the company said in a blog post. That may be appealing to businesses, or just business people, many of whom are looking to tablets as portable work devices. That puts it squarely in the same category as Microsoft's Surface, which is heavily billed as a laptop replacement. The Nexus tablet will cost 399 for a 16GB version and 479 for a 32 GB version when it comes on on Oct. 29. LTE connectivity ups the price to 599. Google also introduced the Nexus Player, a streaming media console similar to a Roku or Apple TV. It's the first Google device to use its Android TV platform that the company introduced in June. In addition to carrying streaming video channels such as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Google's own YouTube, the player also has a strong focus on games -- an quality also emphasized by Amazon for its Fire TV. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) The Nexus Player will cost 99 and comes with a voice-activated remote; its optional game controller costs 40. Finally, Google also took the wraps off the name for its latest operating system, previously only known as \\"L\\" -- which it's calling Lollipop. Google always names its operating systems after sweet treats and in alphabetical order. Lollipop, also known as Android 5.0, follows Android KitKat, which was released last year. The new operating system is designed to work on a number of devices including phones and tablets, as well as next-generation gadgets such as smart TVs and smart cars.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a \\"[a].\\" movie review (Possible answers: [a]. negative. [b]. positive.).","completion":"[a]. Negative Movie Review: Title: \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Letdown\\" From the very beginning, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Letdown\\" promised to provide a captivating and evocative cinematic experience but unfortunately fell well short of both expectations and its own hype. As a critic, I find myself hard-pressed to detail the numerous ways in which its narrative flounders, its characters falter, and its themes confuse rather than enlighten. The film's plot attempts to weave together an intricate tapestry of personal drama, social commentary, and thought-provoking questions, but the result is instead an indecipherable mess of lackluster scenes, tangents, and half-baked motivations. The pacing is noticeably inconsistent, sluggishly meandering in some points while frantically rushing key emotional moments in others, effectively diminishing their emotional resonance. Regarding the performances, it's unfortunate to report that the actors' talents are underutilized, as the subpar script does little to inspire. Many of the dialogue-heavy scenes resemble a choreographed reading rather than an impassioned display of realistic human relationships, despite the well-known names headlining the production. The chemistry between the leads is utterly unconvincing, and the array of secondary characters feels more like an afterthought than an essential part of the story. Visually, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Letdown\\" proves to be no saving grace. The uninspired cinematography, replete with cliche shots and predictable framing, does little to maintain the viewer's interest. Moreover, the special effects, which could have provided some level of stylistic excitement, are all too obviously low-budget and not up-to-par with contemporary film standards. The film's score likewise falls flat, consisting of a generic mix of sound design elements that detract from already weak sequences rather than imbuing them with any sense of atmosphere or urgency. One might even argue that the music runs counter to the film's purported themes, undermining the seriousness of the subject matter by its apparent incongruity with the visuals and narrative at play. Ultimately, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Letdown\\" is a film that is better left unheard and unseen, as it offers a lackluster experience to those who would seek an engaging, substantial time at the movies. Spectators who have encountered its promising trailers and marketing campaign will undoubtedly lament the wasted potential and money spent on what could have been a powerful study of the human condition. Instead, we are left with a poorly-executed production that leaves a bitter aftertaste, serving as a stark reminder of the need for quality storytelling, craftsmanship, and passion in filmmaking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - vessel - box - transistor - submarine - lamp The rationale to choose \\"transistor\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"A transistor radio is the correct choice for someone to use to reach base, and here's the rationale for that choice: A. Vessel - A vessel usually refers to a container or a hollow structure for holding something, or a ship, boat, or other craft. It doesn't serve as a communication device like a radio. B. Box - A box here is unrelated to communication devices and serves primarily as a container to store or transport items. C. Transistor - A transistor radio is a type of radio that primarily relies on transistors as its primary electronic component for receiving and amplifying signals. Transistor radios are lightweight, portable, and can operate on low power, making them ideal for communication over moderate distances. Often, these radios are used in team activities or events where quick communication with a base or headquarters is essential. D. Submarine - A submarine is a watercraft capable of operating independently underwater. It is not a type of radio used for communication with a base. E. Lamp - A lamp is a device for producing artificial light, typically by using electricity. It is not a form of radio equipment or a communication device. By eliminating the unrelated choices, it becomes clear that a transistor radio is the appropriate choice for someone to use to reach base effectively."},{"prompt":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: The Flintstones is light-hearted, and very entertaining, and sometimes that is all films are meant to do, entertain!

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: At a Sunset Boulevard mansion, the body of Joe Gillis floats in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death. Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it in Joe's presence, unaware that he is the author. Later, while fleeing from repossession men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning he is a writer, she asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in a comeback. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor. Moved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who tells him Norma is subject to depression and has made suicide attempts. Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him. He tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green to ask about staying at his place. At Artie's party, he again meets Betty, who he learns is Artie's girl. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When Joe phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Question: what president made decision to buy louisiana? Would \\"At the time, the purchase faced domestic opposition because it was thought to be unconstitutional .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"While the provided answer choice briefly touches on some aspects of the Louisiana Purchase, it does not directly answer the question about which President made the decision to buy Louisiana. A more appropriate and detailed response would be: The President who made the decision to buy Louisiana was Thomas Jefferson. He was the third President of the United States, serving from 1801 to 1809. The Louisiana Purchase took place in 1803 when President Thomas Jefferson's administration secured a deal with France to acquire the territory of Louisiana, which was vast and stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, and from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. This land acquisition doubled the size of the United States at the time and was one of Thomas Jefferson's most significant achievements during his presidency. The total cost of the purchase was approximately 15 million. Although the answer choice you mentioned does not directly answer the question, it is crucial to address the constitutional concerns that arose during that time. The decision to buy Louisiana faced domestic opposition as some believed that the purchase went against the United States Constitution. They argued that nowhere in the Constitution was the federal government granted explicit power to acquire new territory. Nevertheless, President Jefferson decided to interpret the Constitution in a more flexible way, invoking the government's authority to negotiate treaties and make land deals. Despite the initial controversy surrounding the purchase, the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory proved to be a turning point in American history. It facilitated westward expansion, provided fertile land for agriculture and settlement, and led to significant economic growth. The Louisiana Purchase has been since regarded as one of the most consequential and far-reaching actions in the early history of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Which of the following was one of the ideals of Hellenistic art: sensuality, idealism, or stoicism? Context: Hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos). The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.","completion":"Step 1: Identify the question: The question is asking which of the following ideals was exemplified in Hellenistic art: sensuality, idealism, or stoicism.

It also mentions that the female nude became more popular, and art became more erotic.

The statement \\"Stanley Cup is 2-3-2\\" implies that the team with home-ice advantage would host the first two games, then the opponent would host the next three games, and finally, the team with home-ice advantage would host the last two games. Comparing the context to the statement, we can observe that the given information does not match the statement. The actual format of the Stanley Cup playoffs is 2-2-1-1-1, not 2-3-2. Conclusion: The statement \\"Is Stanley Cup 2-3-2?\\" is incorrect. The correct format for Stanley Cup playoffs is 2-2-1-1-1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - optical device - garden patch - blender - pantry - vegetable stew The rationale to choose \\"vegetable stew\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The potato becomes softer in a \\"vegetable stew\\". The rationale behind choosing \\"vegetable stew\\" as the answer is that a potato softens when cooked, particularly in a moist environment such as a stew. The heat from cooking in a stew breaks down the potato's cell walls, allowing the starch granules to absorb the liquid, swell and gelatinize, resulting in the potato becoming soft and tender. Here's a brief explanation of why the other choices are not suitable: - Optical device: This is a completely unrelated category, which refers to any device that uses light, such as lenses, prisms, or mirrors, to manipulate the path or properties of light. It will not affect the texture of a potato. - Garden patch: This refers to a designated area of soil where plants, including potatoes, are grown. The potato may grow larger when it is still a part of a living potato plant, but it will not become softer in a garden patch. - Blender: A blender is a kitchen appliance used for blending, mixing, or puréeing food ingredients. Although blending a potato can change its texture by puréeing it, the potato does not actually become softer within a blender. Rather, it gets broken down into smaller pieces. - Pantry: A pantry is a room or closet where food and beverages are stored. It is not a place where a potato would become softer. In fact, leaving a potato in a pantry for an extended period may cause it to sprout or become dehydrated and shrink."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How is \\"Am I immediately nominated when I submit my blog?\\" said in Russian?","completion":"In Russian, the question \\"Am I immediately nominated when I submit my blog?\\" can be translated as \\"Буду ли я немедленно номинирован, когда отправлю свой блог?\\" Here is a detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Am I\\" - \\"Буду ли я\\" (pronounced: budu li ya): In this context, \\"буду\\" is the first person singular form of the verb \\"to be\\" in future tense, which indicates that the subject (I) will be in a certain state. \\"ли\\" is a particle used in asking questions, similar to the English question mark. \\"я\\" means \\"I\\" and is the subject of the sentence. 2. \\"immediately\\" - \\"немедленно\\" (pronounced: nyemiedlyenno): This adverb is used to indicate that the action or event occurs right away, without any delay. It can be translated more precisely as \\"without delay\\" or \\"instantly.\\" 3. \\"nominated\\" - \\"номинирован\\" (pronounced: nominirovan): This word is derived from the verb \\"номинировать\\" (nominirovat'), which means \\"to nominate\\" or \\"to propose someone for a job, position, reward, etc.\\" In this case, \\"номинирован\\" is the passive past participle form in masculine gender, which is translated into English as \\"nominated.\\" 4. \\"when\\" - \\"когда\\" (pronounced: kogda): This conjunction connects two parts of a sentence and indicates the time of an action or event. In this case, it is used to link the main clause (\\"Буду ли я немедленно номинирован\\") with the subordinate clause (\\"когда отправлю свой блог\\"). 5. \\"I submit\\" - \\"отправлю\\" (pronounced: otpravlyu): This word is the main verb of the subordinate clause and is derived from the verb \\"отправлять\\" (otpravlyat'), which means \\"to send\\" or \\"to submit.\\" \\"Отправлю\\" is the first person singular form in future tense, which means \\"I will send\\" or \\"I will submit.\\" 6. \\"my\\" - \\"свой\\" (pronounced: svoi): This is a possessive pronoun that indicates ownership or possession. In this case, it refers to the speaker's blog, so it can be translated as \\"my.\\" 7. \\"blog\\" - \\"блог\\" (pronounced: blog): This word refers to a personal website or online journal where an individual can express their thoughts, ideas, etc. In Russian, the word \\"блог\\" is borrowed from English and is used in the same meaning. So the entire sentence \\"Буду ли я немедленно номинирован, когда отправлю свой блог?\\" can be understood as \\"Am I going to be nominated immediately when I submit my blog?\\" in English."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the man who was considered a \\"dangerous modernist\\" elected president of in March 1863?, using the article: In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"In March 1863, the man who was considered a \\"dangerous modernist\\" was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists.

You must perform the following operations to generate the required output list: (i) Find the longest common substring in the strings A and B, (ii) Convert this substring to all lowercase and sort it alphabetically, (iii) Replace the substring at its respective positions in the two lists with the updated substring. Q: tNWlrXNtt, MLlrXGiM A:","completion":"Part #1: Find the longest common substring in the strings A and B. Usage: In the given strings \\"tNWlrXNtt\\" and \\"MLlrXGiM,\\" the longest common substring is \\"lrX.\\" This meets the criteria because \\"lrX\\" is the longest sequence of characters that appear consecutively in both strings. Part #2: Convert this substring to all lowercase and sort it alphabetically. Usage: Given the common substring \\"lrX,\\" converting it to lowercase results in \\"lrx,\\" and sorting it alphabetically gives \\"lrx\\" itself (as it is already sorted). This meets the criteria because all characters are lowercase and sorted alphabetically. Part #3: Replace the substring at its respective positions in the two lists with the updated substring. Usage: The two original strings \\"tNWlrXNtt\\" and \\"MLlrXGiM\\" now become \\"tNWlrxNtt\\" and \\"MLlrxGiM,\\" respectively. The required output list is [\\"tNWlrxNtt\\", \\"MLlrxGiM\\"]. This meets the criteria because the updated lowercase, alphabetically sorted substring \\"lrx\\" replaces the original substring \\"lrX\\" in the given strings, and both strings are listed as the final output."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I. Jo\\". On returning from the Pacific theater, a veteran told Stafford that the Japanese would play her records on loudspeakers in an attempt to make the U.S. troops homesick enough to surrender. She replied personally to all the letters she received from servicemen.

Question: suppose the directions are being read wrong happens, how will it affect If more water filters into the rocks. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If more water filters into the rocks than initially described in the process, it will have a \\"more\\" effect on the second effect mentioned, which is \\"The water freezes and thaws\\". Justification: 1. More water seeping into the rocks means there's a greater volume of water available to freeze and thaw. The freezing and thawing process results in an expansion and contraction effect which applies pressure on the rock. 2. If there is more water present, the water when freezes will expand more, creating larger or more numerous cracks in the rocks during the freezing and thawing process. 3. This potentially accelerates the rate at which the rocks can crack and break down because of the increased pressure exerted by the larger volume of freezing and thawing water. 4. Additionally, the possibility of the cracks being filled with more water also increases, further enhancing the process of rock breakdown. So, the supposed perturbation of more water filtering into the rocks would likely increase the effect of the water freezing and thawing process, leading to more cracks and quicker breakdown of the rocks."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

What is the answer?","completion":"The only letter in the game of Scrabble that scores five points is the letter K. Scrabble is a well-known board game that has enjoyed worldwide popularity since its first appearance in 1938, designed by Alfred Mosher Butts. The game revolves around forming words by placing lettered tiles on the board, with more points awarded for using less common letters. In Scrabble, each letter has a different point value. The scoring system is designed to balance the frequency of a letter in the English language and the difficulty in using it to form words. The letter K is assigned a relatively high score of five points because it is a less common letter and can be more challenging to use in word formation compared to other high-frequency letters. The point values for all the letters in Scrabble are as follows: - 1 point: A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, and U - 2 points: D and G - 3 points: B, C, M, and P - 4 points: F, H, V, W, and Y - 5 points: K - 8 points: J and X - 10 points: Q and Z While playing Scrabble, players are also awarded points based on the placement of their tiles on bonus squares that multiply the value of the letter or the entire word.

Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work. According to The Times: \\"Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from Bowie\\". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \\"parting gift\\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \\"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day. On 15 January, Blackstar debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart.

The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday.

This article: In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

It is bordered on the north by Lake Huron, which is drained by the St. Clair River, the county's western border and part of the Canada-United States border. To the south is Lake Saint Clair and Chatham-Kent, another county in Ontario. Lambton County's northeastern border follows the Ausable River and Parkhill Creek north until it reaches Lake Huron at the beach community of Grand Bend. The county seat is in the Town of Plympton-Wyoming. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - The Huronian glaciation (or Makganyene glaciation) was a glaciation that extended from 2.4 billion years ago (Ga) to 2.1 Ga, during the Siderian and Rhyacian periods of the Paleoproterozoic era. The Huronian glaciation followed after the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), a time when increased atmospheric oxygen decreased atmospheric methane. The oxygen combined with the methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which does not retain heat as well as methane does. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Nunavut (from Inuktitut: ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949. - Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within the United States. The other four Great Lakes are shared by the U.S. and Canada. It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third-largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia). To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake. Lake Michigan is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include, Chicago, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gary, Indiana, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The word \\"Michigan\\" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word \\"mishigami\\" meaning \\"great water\\". In the earliest European maps of the region, the name of Lake Illinois has been found in addition to that of \\"Michigan\\". - Lake MichiganHuron (also HuronMichigan) is the combined waters of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, which are joined through the wide, 20-fathom (120 ft; 37 m) deep, open-water Straits of Mackinac. Huron and Michigan are technically a single lake because the flow of water through the straits keeps their water levels in near-equilibrium. (Although the flow is generally eastward, the water moves in either direction depending on local conditions.) Combined, Lake MichiganHuron is the largest fresh water lake by area in the world. If Lake Huron and Lake Michigan are considered two separate lakes, Lake Superior is larger than either. - The St. Clair River is a river in central North America which drains Lake Huron into Lake St. Clair, forming part of the international boundary between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Michigan. The river is a significant component in the Great Lakes Waterway, with shipping channels permitting cargo vessels to travel between the upper and lower Great Lakes. - Kettle Point 44 is an Indian reserve 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) northeast of Sarnia , Ontario , Canada , on the southern shore of Lake Huron . The reserve serves as the land base for the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nations . There are two nations on this reserve , Chippewas of Kettle Point , and Chippewas of Stony Point . Its area is 895.7 ha . They are two of 42 Anishinaabeg First Nations in Ontario , and belongs to the Union of Ontario Indians . - Lake Huron is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. Hydrologically, it comprises the easterly portion of Lake MichiganHuron, having the same surface elevation as its westerly counterpart, to which it is connected by the , Straits of Mackinac. It is shared on the east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the west by the state of Michigan in the United States. The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the Huron people inhabiting the region. The Huronian glaciation was named due to evidence collected from Lake Huron region. The northern parts of the lake include the North Channel and Georgian Bay. The main inlet is the St. Marys River and the main outlet is the St. Clair. - The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada. At a land area of approximately and a 2011 population of 41,462, it is the second largest and most populous of the three territories in Northern Canada. Its estimated population as of 2016 is 44,291. Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission. - Le Griffon (\\"The Griffin\\") was a 17th-century barque built by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in his quest to find the Northwest Passage to China and Japan. - The Indian Act (\\"An Act respecting Indians\\"), is a Canadian Act of Parliament that concerns registered Indians, their bands, and the system of Indian reserves. First passed in 1876 and still in force with amendments, it is the primary document which governs how the Canadian state interacts with the 614 First Nation bands in Canada and their members. Throughout its long history the Act has been an ongoing source of controversy and has been interpreted in many ways by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians. The legislation has been amended many times, including \\"over twenty major changes\\" made by 2002. - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. - The Straits of Mackinac is a narrow waterway in the U.S. state of Michigan, between Michigan's Lower and Upper Peninsulas. The Straits of Mackinac connect two of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The straits are wide and deep. Hydrologically, the two connected lakes can be considered one, which is called Lake MichiganHuron. Historically, the region around the Straits was known by the native Odawa people as Michilimackinac. - In Canada, an Indian reserve is specified by the Indian Act as a \\"tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.\\" - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganHuron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis. - Southwestern Ontario is a secondary region of Southern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario, centered on the city of London. It occupies most of a peninsula that is bound on three sides by water: Lake Huron, including Georgian Bay, to the north and northwest; the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River, to the west; and Lake Erie to the south. To the east, on land, Southwestern Ontario is bounded by Central Ontario and the Golden Horseshoe. The region had a population of 2,504,878 in 2011. - Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, and had a 2011 population of 72,366. It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County. Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River, which forms the Canada-United States border, directly across from Port Huron, Michigan. The city's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle, who named the site \\"The Rapids\\" when he had horses and men pull his barque \\"Le Griffon\\" up the almost four-knot current of the St. Clair River on 23 August 1679. - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec) were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area. - Georgian Bay (French: \\"Baie Georgienne\\") is a large bay of Lake Huron, located entirely within Ontario, Canada. The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island. To its northwest is the North Channel. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Suspect in Russian Spy Case Felt Unappreciated by Handlers For years, Richard Murphy lived a seemingly cushy life: a stay-at-home dad living in a suburban house allegedly paid for by the Russian government, and apparently producing remarkably little espionage. Yet court documents paint Mr. Murphy as a whiny, disgruntled spy-agency employee even while he served as a ringleader, passing cash and computer equipment to his alleged co-conspirators. Suspects Richard and Cynthia Murphy, in an undated photo, picnic at the apartment building where they formerly lived in Hoboken, N.J. Mr. Murphy was set to leave the country Sunday, possibly for good, said people familiar with the investigation. Authorities feared losing Mr. Murphy, triggering the arrest of the alleged \\"deep cover\\" spy ring they had been shadowing for at least a decade. All but one of the 11 members of the alleged ring remain in federal custody. One suspect apparently jumped bail Wednesday. Christopher Metsos, who the Federal Bureau of Investigation said shuttled between Moscow and the U.S. to coordinate the spy network, had been arrested Tuesday in Cyprus while preparing to board a flight to Budapest, Hungary. He posted bail as the U.S. sought extradition on charges of conspiracy to conduct espionage and money laundering \\"After he failed to show up at the police station by 8:00 p.m., we sought him at his hotel to see if he was okay, and there we determined that he had fled,\\" said a senior Cyprus police official speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr. Murphy's lawyer declined to comment. Ms. Murphy's attorney did not respond to messages. Mr. Metsos' lawyer could not be identified. Mr. Murphy was one of 10 people arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to act as unregistered agents of a foreign government; nine have bail hearings scheduled for Thursday and the tenth on Monday. Read more about the spy suspects and allegations against them in the complaints. Businesswoman Anna Chapman, arrested earlier this week on suspicion of being a spy for Russia, speaks about her fledgling enterprise at a conference for entrepreneurs in New York in April. Mr. Metsos was one of those who fielded Mr. Murphy's complaints. In 2002, for example, the FBI says it recorded a testy exchange between the two suspects. Mr. Murphy let loose with a litany of frustrations, to which Mr. Metsos acidly replied, \\"Well, I'm so happy I'm not your handler.\\" Just three months ago, Mr. Murphy, known to the FBI as \\"defendant #2'' and to his alleged spy handlers as \\"A,'' griped to another suspect that their bosses back home didn't appreciate the difficulties they faced. \\"They don't understand what we go through over here,'' Mr. Murphy said during a covert meeting in Brooklyn, according to FBI court papers. And in the summer of 2009, according to the FBI, Mr. Murphy and his wife, Cynthia Murphy, got into a dispute with their bosses at an intelligence headquarters known as \\"Center,\\" over whether they should buy their New Jersey home. Their handlers allegedly insisted the spy agency own the home. Court documents portray Mr. Murphy as the biggest fish in the group of alleged spies living in the U.S. under false identities. He met regularly with Mr. Metsos, the group's contact from Center, taking bundles of cash and splitting it up with other members of the group, according to the FBI. Earlier this year, Mr. Murphy flew to Moscow for a week with a laptop Center had told him to buy: an Asus EE PC 1005HA-P. He returned to the U.S. with the same model laptop, giving it to one of his alleged co-conspirators to communicate with Center, according to the FBI. Mr. Murphy and his wife, Cynthia Murphy, appear to have been the operation's most productive members, according to documents released by authorities. Ms. Murphy, who worked at Morea Financial Services, a firm in lower Manhattan that offered tax advice, allegedly met several times with an unnamed New York financier who was identified by authorities as a political donor and friend of a sitting cabinet official. Financier Alan Patricof said in a statement Wednesday that he met with Ms. Murphy a few times and spoke with her frequently on the phone since retaining Morea Financial Services 2½ years ago to handle his personal accounting and tax services. \\"We never—not once—discussed any matter other than my finances and certainly she never inquired about, nor did we ever discuss, any matters relating to politics, the government, or world affairs,\\" Mr. Patricof said. \\"Since I understand she was employed by Morea approximately ten years before I became a client, I highly doubt that I could have been an intended target by her.\\" Ms. Murphy's financial job put her in regular contact with wealthy people. Former employees at her company, and at Morea & Schwartz, a law firm in the same building that was run by the husband of Ms. Murphy's boss, described her as a sweet, unassuming woman who spoke with an accent; one former co-worker thought she was from Belgium. \\"There was nothing out of the ordinary about her,\\" said Aliza Herzberg, 40 years old, who worked at Morea & Schwartz. Another employee, who did not want to be named, said Ms. Murphy was shy when she began working there but gradually opened up.—except when it came to her husband. \\"Anything having to do with her husband was completely off limits,\\" this person said. Ms. Murphy had urged her husband to \\"improve his information-collection efforts,\\" according to court documents. Yet both she and their alleged Moscow bosses advised Mr. Murphy against taking a job that would require an extensive background check, according to the FBI. That reluctance to penetrate the U.S. government epitomizes one of the biggest mysteries of the alleged spy ring: It did not appear to garner many U.S. government secrets. Indeed, from information released so far, none of the alleged spies worked for the government, though some moved in elite circles. Accused spy Anna Chapman lived for several years in London, where she attended elite charity balls and worked at places such as Barclays PLC. Another suspect, Donald Howard Healthfield, graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and ran a consulting firm targeting governments and businesses. One of the Murphys' neighbors, who asked not to be named, also noticed \\"unusual\\" traits. \\"He clearly was Russian with a name of Murphy—I thought it was weird,\\" said the neighbor, who lived near their home in Montclair, N.J., which records show the Murphys purchased in August 2008 for 481,000. When news broke of their arrest, this person said, \\"I just wasn't that surprised.\\" Write to Evan Perez at evan.perez@wsj.com and Alkman Granitsas at alkman.granitsas@dowjones.com Summary:","completion":"Richard Murphy, a suspect in a Russian spy case, was reportedly unhappy with his spy handlers.

The statement talks about the eventual dominance of the Babylonian Empire in the south of Mesopotamia, rather than the specific dynasty of Ur that signaled the last great Sumerian renaissance. To answer your question, the Third Dynasty of Ur, also known as the Neo-Sumerian Empire or Ur III, was the last great Sumerian renaissance. The Third Dynasty of Ur emerged in the late 21st century BC (circa 2112-2004 BC) and marked a period of significant political, cultural, and economic revival in the region. During the reign of the Third Dynasty of Ur, the Sumerian civilization expanded its territory and influence significantly. The kings of this period, such as Ur-Nammu, Shulgi, and others, were highly effective rulers. They enacted administrative, legal, and economic reforms that resulted in the growth and stability of the empire. Sumerian art and architecture also witnessed a revival, with the construction of several magnificent temples and palaces, and the creation of intricate works of art. However, the Third Dynasty of Ur experienced a decline around the 21st century BC, due to external pressures from neighboring civilizations and internal conflicts.

Festivals often feature live performances by various artists, bands, and musicians, attracting large crowds who want to enjoy the music and be entertained. Music can evoke emotions, create a sense of togetherness, and provide an atmosphere of celebration and fun, which are essential aspects of festivals. While other options like playing games, talking, and eating ice cream can also be part of the festival experience, the core attraction usually revolves around music, making it the most fitting answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Determine the sentiment: If you're a fan of the late Gram Parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you! Part comedy, part road movie, but mostly a bad fictionalization of one of rock history's oddest tales. SPOILERS-- Basically the story concerns a well-known roadie named Phil Kaufman (played by Johnny Knoxville) who \\"supposedly\\" made a pact with cult rock/country/folk music hero Gram Parsons that stated when one of them died first (it didn't matter which one it was) that the other living one was to take the deceased out to the desert, Joshua Tree National Park in California to be exact, and set the body ablaze...so as to free the spirit and become one with the earth, and so on! Sure to keep his word the barely sober Kaufman, with the assistance of a self-hating, pot-headed buddy, jacks the body of the late Parsons -whom had fatally overdosed from a drug and booze bender a day prior- from the airport. And shortly after that what ensues is a cringe-worthy combination of fiction and truth where the late Parsons girlfriend, Kaufman's girlfriend, Parsons stone-faced father, and a gaggle of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock (so to speak) in trying to catch Kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch Parsons body! The film's incompetent direction, bad acting, and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the Titanic. And not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place. The accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies, as far as I've heard them, include: number 1., Parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child, so what the hell was that all about with the girlfriend's and the chasing and whatnot?, number 2., Kaufman's drugged-out buddy was a known willing participant (unlike what the movie attempts to portray) in the disposing of Parson's body, and finally number 3., Gram Parsons real-life father died when he was just a boy, and so it was Parson's step-father (who could have honestly cared less about Gram Parsons when he was still alive) in real-life that took care of the body after it was torched! Altogether though, what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real Phil Kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story. And yet still, the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really boggles my mind, frankly! Also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned it's lead character, played by the ultra-grating Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman), is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie, and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical, brain-dead, or seem utterly clueless as to what they're actually doing there in the first place! Overall, if you like Johnny Knoxville and or really dig the so-bad-they're-not-even-good buddy flicks then I suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie! But, if you're like me and are a fan of the late Gram Parsons, enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if they're based on an actual real-life story, and or you just like good films, be-them road movies, or fictional slice-of-life stuff, you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise. I obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place, but since it was made I would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did, unfortunately! Maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of Gram Parsons life...not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it. But, until that time comes all we as an audience, and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an all-around terrible memorial (of sorts) to the musical legacy that Gram Parsons was known to have left behind. It should also be noted that they did actually use Parsons music, and a few others as well in the flick, but not surprisingly though, you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the film's inaccuracies, bad acting, incompetent direction, and offbeat tone. They describe the movie as a waste of film and a terrible memorial to Gram Parsons' musical legacy, ultimately giving it a rating of zero stars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since she asked \\"How did she do that?\\", she is interested in understanding the circumstances that led to Sally breaking her arm. Option (A) is not correct because the conversation does not mention anything about Sally losing money. Option (B) is correct because the woman asks how Sally broke her arm, essentially inquiring about the action that caused the injury.

Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film. But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \\"gun rights\\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish. Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it. But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK. This is the key message of this part of the animation, which is again being ignored by its critics. Buell shooting in Flint. You write: \\"Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before\\". This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against. It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset.
