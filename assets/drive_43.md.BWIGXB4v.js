Q:Information: - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination. - The Balearic Islands are an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. - Roussillon (or ; ) is one of the historical counties of the former Principality of Catalonia, corresponding roughly to the present-day southern French \\"département\\" of Pyrénées-Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees). It may also refer to \\"Northern Catalonia\\" or \\"French Catalonia\\", the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it. - Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula. Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the \\"vicarius\\" for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name, Hispania, was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. - The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD. - Languedoc-Roussillon is a former administrative region of France. Since 1 January 2016, it is part of the new region Occitanie. It comprises five departments, and borders the other French regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Rhône-Alpes, Auvergne, Midi-Pyrénées on the one side, and Spain, Andorra and the Mediterranean Sea on the other side. It is the southernmost region of mainland France. - Hispania Ulterior (English: \\"Further Spain\\", or occasionally \\"Thither Spain\\") was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly located in Baetica and in the Guadalquivir valley of modern Spain and extending to all of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca province) and Gallaecia (modern Northern Portugal and Galicia). Its capital was Corduba. - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. - Languedoc ( Occitan: \\"Lengadòc\\" ) is a former province of France. Its territory is now contained in the modern-day region of Occitanie in the south of France. Its capital city was Toulouse. It had an area of approximately 27,376 square kilometers (10,570 square miles). - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\". - Gallia Narbonensis (Latin for \\"Gaul of Narbonne\\", from its chief settlement) was a Roman province located in what is now Languedoc and Provence, in southern France. It was also known as Provincia Nostra (\\"our Province\\"), from its having been the first Roman province north of the Alps, and as Gallia Transalpina (\\"Transalpine Gaul\\"), distinguishing it from Cisalpine Gaul in northern Italy. It became a Roman province in the late 2nd century BC. Its boundaries were roughly defined by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and the Cévennes and Alps to the north and west. The western region of Gallia Narbonensis was known as Septimania. - Arius (250 or 256336) was a Christian presbyter and ascetic of Berber origin, and priest in Baucalis in Alexandria, Egypt. His teachings about the nature of the Godhead in Christianity, which emphasized the Father's divinity over the Son, and his opposition to what would become the dominant Christology, Homoousian Christology, made him a primary topic of the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened by Emperor Constantine the Great in 325. - Tarraco is the ancient name of the current city of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). It was the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula, founded during the Second Punic War by Scipio Calvus, and became capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, and of Hispania Tarraconensis during the Roman Empire. - Septimania ( ) was the western region of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed under the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply Gallia or Narbonensis. It corresponded roughly with the modern French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba in the eighth century before its conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (\\"Marca Gothica\\"). - God the Father is a title given to God in various religions, most prominently in Christianity. In mainstream trinitarian Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first person of the Trinity, followed by the second person God the Son (Jesus Christ) and the third person God the Holy Spirit. Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in \\"God the Father (Almighty)\\", primarily as his capacity as \\"Father and creator of the universe\\". Yet, in Christianity the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ goes metaphysically further than the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostle's Creed where the expression of belief in the \\"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\\" is immediately, but separately followed by in \\"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood. - Arianism, in Christianity, is a Christological concept that asserts that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who was created by God the Father at a point in time, is distinct from the Father and is, therefore subordinate to God and not the same as. Arian teachings were first attributed to Arius (c. AD 250336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt. The teachings of Arius and his supporters were opposed to the prevailing theological views held by proto-orthodox Christians, regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ. The Arian concept of Christ is that the Son of God did not always exist but was created by God the Father. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half. - Hispania Citerior (English: \\"Hither Spain\\", or \\"Nearer Spain\\") was a Roman Province in Hispania during the Roman Republic. It was on the eastern coast of Spain down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia and Valencia. Further south there was the Roman Province of Hispania Ulterior (\\"Further Spain\\"), which further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River Ebro. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the Celtiberians who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of Hispania Tarraconensis, which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, Hispania Lusitania. - Gallaecia or Callaecia, also known as Hispania Gallaecia, was the name of a Roman province in the north-west of Hispania, approximately present-day Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Leon and the later Suebic Kingdom of Gallaecia. The Roman cities included the port Cale (Porto), the governing centers Bracara Augusta (Braga), Lucus Augusti (Lugo) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and their administrative areas Conventus bracarensis, Conventus lucensis and Conventus asturicensis. - Reccared ( or Recared ; Latin : Reccaredus ; Spanish : Recaredo ) I ( c. 559 -- 31 May 601 ) ( reigned 586 -- 601 ) was Visigothic King of Hispania , Septimania and Galicia . His reign marked a climactic shift in history , with the king 's renunciation of Arianism in favour of Chalcedonian Christianity in 587 . Reccared was the younger son of King Leovigild by his first wife Theodosia . Like his father , Reccared had his capital at Toledo . The Visigothic kings and nobles were traditionally Arian Christians , while the Hispano - Roman population were Roman Catholics . The Catholic bishop Leander of Seville was instrumental in converting the elder son and heir of Leovigild , Hermenegild , to Catholicism . Leander supported his rebellion and was exiled for his role . When King Leovigild died , within a few weeks of April 21 , 586 , bishop Leander was swift to return to Toledo . The new king had been associated with his father in ruling the kingdom and was acclaimed king by the Visigothic nobles without opposition . In January 587 , Reccared renounced Arianism for Catholicism , the single great event of his reign and the turning point for Visigothic Hispania . Most Arian nobles and ecclesiastics followed his example , certainly those around him at Toledo , but there were Arian uprisings , notably in Septimania , his northernmost province , beyond the Pyrenees , where the leader of opposition was the Arian bishop Athaloc , who had the reputation among his Catholic enemies of being virtually a second Arius . Among the secular leaders of the Septimanian insurrection , the counts Granista and Wildigern appealed to Guntram of Burgundy , who saw his opportunity and sent his dux Desiderius . Reccared 's army defeated the Arian insurgents and their Catholic allies with great slaughter , Desiderius himself being slain . The next conspiracy broke out in the west , Lusitania , headed by Sunna , the Arian bishop of Mérida , and count Seggo . Claudius , Reccared 's dux Lusitaniae , put down the rising , Sunna being banished... - Theodoric II (Gothic: Þiudareiks II), \\"Teodorico\\" in Spanish and Portuguese, (426 early 466) was the eighth King of Visigoths from 453 to 466. - Lusitania or Hispania Lusitana was an ancient Iberian Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people). Its capital was \\"Emerita Augusta\\" (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire. Romans first came to the territory around the mid 2nd century BC. A war with Lusitanian tribes followed, from 155 to 139 BC. In 27 BC, the province was created.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

They were frequently criticized by nobles who feared the possibility of an environment in which class and its accompanying titles and privileges were disregarded. Such an environment was especially intimidating to monarchs who derived much of their power from the disparity between classes of people. If classes were to join together under the influence of Enlightenment thinking, they might recognize the all-encompassing oppression and abuses of their monarchs and, because of their size, might be able to carry out successful revolts.

As members of our close and compassionate community, we are thrilled to extend a gentle reminder regarding our ongoing Adopt a Kid Program. This initiative aims to bring the gift of love, support, and stability into the lives of children in need, ultimately transforming their prospects for leading healthy, fulfilling lives. While many children are fortunate to enjoy the warmth of a loving family, countless others are still waiting for a chance to experience the care and security that comes from having a forever home. This is your opportunity to transform a child's life by providing them with an environment where they can thrive.

Our top priority is to ensure that these children find stable, loving families who can provide the emotional support, care, and nurturing they need. We take every measure to ensure transparency and a smooth transition for both the child and the adoptive family, guiding you through every step. The Benefits of Adoption: 1. Unconditional love and companionship: Adoption enables children to enjoy a loving family and a stable environment, which can positively impact their development and overall well-being. 2. Emotional growth: Adoption gives both the adoptive family and the child an opportunity for emotional growth as they share life experiences, navigate challenges, and work together to create a home filled with love and understanding. 3. A brighter future: Every child deserves a chance at a brighter future. Adoption can provide the support, resources, and opportunities children need to succeed in life and contribute positively to society. 4. Building a family: Adoption often enriches the lives of not only the adopting parents but also their entire family, from grandparents to siblings. Adopting a child can expand and strengthen your familial bonds with an extraordinary and fulfilling experience. How You Can Help: 1. Spread the word: Raise awareness about the Adopt a Kid program and the importance of providing supportive families to children in need. Share the initiative on social media, with your friends, and in your community. 2. Volunteer: Our organization always needs dedicated volunteers to help facilitate adoptions, provide administrative support, and lend a hand in fundraising events. 3.

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

Out of the options given, C: Make sure Robin didn't fall behind best describes Jordan's motivation and intentions. Jordan's actions demonstrate his empathy and concern for Robin's academic progress. By choosing to tutor her, he is directly addressing the problem at hand, which is Robin's struggle to keep up with the material in class. His desire to help Robin improve her understanding of the subject matter shows his kindness and willingness to invest time and effort to assist her. This leads us to disregard option A: Hurt Robin, as it does not align with the actions and intentions of Jordan in the context given. Jordan's purpose is to help and support Robin, not to bring her harm. Thus, this option is not a valid explanation for Jordan's actions.

They had spent a while making the hopscotch markings. They had used sidewalk chalk and ready to play. The girls began jumping to each numbered box. It was great fun playing hopscotch for them. Hypothesis: This has nothing to do with hopscotch.","completion":"The hypothesis stated is incorrect based on the context provided. The context provided is completely about hopscotch, a popular outdoor game typically played by children. This can be deduced on the basis of various clues littered throughout the context. 1. The first word of the context is 'Hopscotch,' which directly introduces the topic of the text that will follow. 2. It is stated that \\"All the girls were ready to start\\". The verb 'start' is an action word that suggests an activity is about to begin, and the preceding mention of hopscotch helps us understand that the action involved is related to this game. 3. Subsequently, it is mentioned that \\"They had spent a while making the hopscotch markings\\". This sentence not only clearly specifies the activity they were preparing or ready to start, i.e., hopscotch, but it also reveals that it involves making certain distinct markings, which are a key part of the hopscotch game setup. 4. The phrase \\"They had used sidewalk chalk\\" further strengthens the argument that this indeed involves hopscotch. Sidewalk chalk is often used to draw the hopscotch diagram on a flat, concrete surface. 5. Lastly, “The girls began jumping to each numbered box”. This line describes the typical actions performed by players of hopscotch, where they jump through the numbered squares on one or two legs as per the rules of the game. In addition to these points, the context also reveals that \\"It was great fun playing hopscotch for them,\\" which definitely establishes that they were engaged in the activity of hopscotch and were enjoying it. In conclusion, the context is entirely about the game of hopscotch - from the preparation (creating the hopscotch markings using sidewalk chalk) to the playing (jumping to each numbered box), and even capturing the feeling of the game (it being fun). Therefore, the hypothesis stating that \\"this has nothing to do with hopscotch\\" is incorrect and contradicted by each sentence in the context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: When someone says, \\"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do? Question: The phrase 'to face the music\\" was first used by _ .

A dog is shown swimming after a ball in the ocean. he","completion":"retrieves the ball successfully and starts to swim back to the shore. In this situation, the most logical next event would involve the dog returning to its owner on the shore or beach, who is most likely observing the event either to ensure the dog's safety or simply enjoying watching the dog play. Once the dog has reached the shore, there are several possibilities as to how the scenario may unfold. They are as follows: 1. Happy reunion: The most probable outcome would be that the dog eagerly approaches its owner, tail wagging, and drops the ball at their feet to show off its successful retrieval. The owner may then praise the dog, pet it to show affection, and perhaps throw the ball again to keep the game going. This exchange could continue for some time, providing both the dog and its owner with joy and physical exercise before they decide to move on or return home. 2. Interaction with other beachgoers or canines: Upon returning to the shore, the dog might also encounter other people or animals who are interested in the ball or the dog's playful nature. This could lead to various forms of social interaction such as the dog engaging in play with another dog, or a friendly passerby asking the owner about their dog or petting it. These interactions could be brief or more prolonged, depending on the individuals involved and the shared enthusiasm for play or conversation. 3. Resting period: After exerting energy in chasing the ball and swimming back to shore, the dog may feel a bit tired. In this case, the dog may lay down on the beach, panting to catch its breath and cool down. The owner might take this opportunity to provide the dog with some fresh water to drink or even offer a treat as a reward for the successful retrieval of the ball. 4. Distractions or challenges: On the way back to its owner, the dog could also come across various distractions such as an interesting scent, seagulls, or other environmental factors that could make returning the ball a more challenging endeavor. If the dog becomes too distracted, the owner may have to intervene by calling the dog's name, using a whistle, or even physically going to retrieve the dog, depending on the situation. 5. Water safety and potential obstacles: In some cases, the dog's swimming path back to shore could be obstructed by ocean currents, large waves, or the presence of aquatic wildlife that could pose a risk or create fear. If this occurs, the dog might struggle to swim back to shore, or even change direction to avoid potential danger. The owner would need to be vigilant in monitoring these factors to ensure the dog's safety and well-being during the activity. If the owner observes any potential dangers, they may have to step in quickly to assist or call the dog back to the shore to prevent any accidents or harm. While there are multiple possibilities for how the scenario may unfold, the most likely and logical next event is the dog returning to its owner on the shore, happily showcasing its successful retrieval of the ball and ready to engage in further play or rest as needed."},{"prompt":"Q: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Title: Mediterraneo Movie plot: In 1941, one year after Italy joined Germany against the Allies in World War II, a small group of misfit Italian soldiers is sent to a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea for four months of lookout duty. The soldiers include a lieutenant who likes art, a macho sergeant, a farmer accompanied by his beloved donkey Silvana, and other quirky people. They are not very good soldiers, but a cross section of average, independent men. The soldiers anticipate attack from outside and on the island and take all sorts of inept precautions. They find a small town with no people. That night, they see bombing on the horizon and realize that the ship that would pick them up has been destroyed. Then mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men, but having seen that the Italians are absolutely harmless they have decided to return to their lives. It isn't long before everyone's sunny nature appears. The Italian soldiers, unacquainted to a war they clearly don't sense as theirs, are absorbed into the life, heat and landscape of the idyllic island. The local orthodox priest asks the lieutenant, a Sunday painter, to restore the murals in his church. Two soldiers, who are brothers, befriend a lovely young woman, a shepherdess. Sergeant Lo Russo, the only member of the crew with a fierly spirit for war, takes up folk dancing, and the shyest of the soldiers, Farina, falls profoundly in love with the island's single, very overworked prostitute, named Vassilissa.

Once you are off the board, you will need to start creating momentum to start rotating backwards. Push your arms further back behind your head. This will arch your back, opening up your chest and pointing it towards the ceiling. This movement will start to rotate the body. If you focus carefully on what is in front of you, you should notice you are spinning because your view will be changing. As you ascend upwards to face the ceiling, bring your knees towards your chest. Keep your toes pointed and your back straight. If you keep proper form, you are more likely to execute the reverse dive. A common misconception about the tuck position is that your arms should be hugging your knees. In fact, your arms should be pulled in at the sides of your body. Place your hands over the mid-part of your shins. Allow the momentum of the turn to move you backwards. When your feet are above and you pointing toward the ceiling, let go of your shins. Begin to extend your legs upwards to point vertically. After you let go of your shins, circle your arms out over your head to hug your ears. Bring your hands together and clasp them. Keep your arms straight and tight with your head planted firmly between them. “Circling out” your arms keeps them in balance and prevents the movement of your arms from disturbing your body position. Your arms should be in line with your body when you enter the water. Keep your head still but focus your eyes on the direction you are moving. When you see the surface of the water clearly, prepare to dive in. Close your eyes and keep your muscles tight and arms and legs fully extended as you enter.

Frustrated at being restricted to fantasy and voyeurism, they decide to film a pornographic movie, in order to gain access to women, money and social standing. Fred (Tony Denman) steals credit card records from one of his father's patients, and posing as adults, they purchase a web hosting service for After School Specialâa site \\"by virgins, for virgins\\". Masquerading as Hawaiians vacationing in Cleveland, they cast local strippers.

He is eventually replaced with Coop (Vince Vieluf), an older student. Meanwhile, Deacon (Erik von Detten) finds the courage to talk to the popular Naomi (Amy Smart) during a party. In a subsequent party, Jake, whom Naomi recently dumped, tries to humiliate Deacon in front of her, but this act only draws the sympathetic Naomi closer to Deacon.

Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.

Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. Teach children how to solve conflicts . Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \\"In what ways didn't you work well together?

Write a text based on this summary: moscow backs off threat as ultimatum expires Text:","completion":"As the ultimatum imposed by Moscow expired, Russian officials have adopted a more conciliatory stance, pulling back from their earlier threat. The change in approach is being hailed internationally as a positive move that could reduce tensions between the parties involved in the dispute. It was previously reported that Moscow had issued an ultimatum, demanding certain conditions to be met within a given timeframe. The details of the ultimatum were largely undisclosed, but it was met with apprehension by other nations who feared that a failure to comply with the demands set forth could lead to conflict. As the deadline approached, however, Moscow unexpectedly backed off from the threat. Russian officials have not publicly stated their reasons for adopting this gentler stance, but several factors have been speculated to have contributed to the decision. Among them was the possibility that issuing the ultimatum was an attempt to test the resolve of the international community, or that it was a calculated move designed to strengthen Russia's bargaining position in negotiations. Regardless of the motivation behind the decision, global leaders have expressed relief over the apparent de-escalation of tensions. Many believe that the withdrawal of the threat allows for more diplomatic measures to be pursued, opening the door for negotiations to settle the differences that led to the ultimatum in the first place. Diplomats from both sides have since arranged meetings to discuss the issues at hand, signifying that the channels of communication have been reopened. As the situation stabilizes, it is hoped that a peaceful resolution can be reached, thereby averting any further threats or escalations. In conclusion, the expiration of Moscow's ultimatum and their decision not to pursue aggressive actions have been welcomed by the international community. Analysts consider this a sign of the potential for peaceful diplomacy and reduced tensions, with many hoping that diplomatic efforts will prove fruitful in resolving the situation amicably."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Nine Americans, including four U.S. troops, were among those killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan's capital this weekend, a western diplomat told CNN Sunday. Saturday's blast -- which also claimed the lives of two British civilians, a Kosovo national and a Canadian soldier -- occurred when a car packed with explosives struck an armored bus in a NATO convoy, the diplomat said. Confusion over casualties arose because some people on board the bus were not listed on its passenger manifest, the diplomat said. Afghan officials said four Afghans, including two students, were also killed. A senior NATO official described the bus as a custom-built, heavily armored Rhino. Canadian Master Cpl. Byron Greff was among the dead, according to the Canadian Expeditionary Force Command. Authorities have not released identities of the other victims. A diplomatic source said the two British citizens who were killed were civilian contractors working for ISAF. Afghan President Hamid Karzai offered his sympathies at a national security meeting Sunday. \\"Afghan people are grieved by the NATO loss of lives and share the pain and sorrow with the families and friends of the troops killed,\\" he said. A Taliban spokesman confirmed Saturday's attack in a text message, saying it killed \\"16 foreign soldiers, one civilian\\" and injured many others. Taliban casualty counts are often inflated; there was no other reliable indication 16 foreigners were killed. It was unclear how many people were wounded, said Sediq Sediqqi, an Interior Ministry spokesman.

U.S. and coalition casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq About 27 people were killed in clashes between troops and suspected insurgents in Nangarhar province, east of Kabul, ISAF said in a statement. Attackers fired rocket-propelled grenades and small arms at coalition troops who were assisting Afghan forces at the site of a land dispute, the statement said. No ISAF forces were injured or killed, the statement said. The fighting erupted after the Taliban convinced members of a tribe that they should attack a convoy carrying government officials to reclaim their land, said Haji Lewani, a tribal elder in the province. About 20 Taliban insurgents and seven tribesmen were among the dead, he said. Also Saturday, a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training, killing three and wounding several others, ISAF said. The shooter was killed in the incident in southern Afghanistan. The coalition did not provide any other details about the shooting, and did not disclose the nationalities of those killed.

How to grow iceberg lettuce Plant the iceberg lettuce six to eight weeks before the last expected spring frost. Fill the bottom of each cell of the tray with some standard potting soil before you sprinkle a few seeds into each cell. Cover the seeds with with a light layer of potting soil.","completion":"Water the soil gently but thoroughly, ensuring that each cell of the tray receives an adequate amount of moisture. Make sure not to overly saturate the soil, as this can lead to issues with seed germination and root development. Place the tray in a warm, sunny location that receives direct sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours per day. A good location could be a windowsill that faces east or south, ensuring that the lettuce seeds receive a sufficient amount of heat and light for germination. Keep the soil consistently moist by misting or gently watering it as needed. The soil should never be allowed to dry out completely nor become waterlogged, as either of these extremes can negatively affect the growth of your iceberg lettuce. Within 7 to 14 days, the seeds should germinate and start to sprout. At this stage, it is essential to maintain consistent moisture levels and the appropriate temperature for their continued growth. Once the seedlings are about 2 inches tall, thin them out by carefully removing the weaker, less developed ones. This will allow the remaining iceberg lettuce to have sufficient space and resources for optimal growth. Transfer the thinned seedlings to larger pots or containers if they are still too close together, to promote unrestricted root development. As your iceberg lettuce seedlings continue to grow, monitor the environmental conditions closely. High temperatures above 75°F (24°C) may cause bolting, an undesirable outcome where the plant starts to flower and produce seeds, which negatively affects the taste and quality of the iceberg lettuce. To prevent bolting, keep the seedlings' environment cool (ideally between 60°F to 70°F or 16°C to 21°C) and ensure that they receive adequate water to keep the soil moist. Approximately 2 weeks before transplanting the iceberg lettuce seedlings into the outdoor garden or larger containers, begin the hardening-off process. Gradually acclimate the seedlings to the outdoor environment by exposing them to natural light, temperature changes, and wind for a few hours at a time, increasing their outdoor time daily. This process will help the plants adapt to the outdoor conditions and will reduce transplant shock, leading to healthier, more robust iceberg lettuce plants. Choose a well-prepared garden bed or large container with well-draining, fertile soil to plant your iceberg lettuce. The location should receive 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. When transplanting, make sure the seedlings are spaced approximately 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) apart to provide enough room for their heads to develop fully. Water the transplanted seedlings regularly, maintaining consistent soil moisture throughout their growth. Inspect the iceberg lettuce plants regularly for any signs of pests or diseases. To control pests such as aphids and slugs, opt for organic methods such as hand-picking, introducing beneficial insects, or using organic insecticidal soap. Keep an eye out for fungal infections and treat any affected plants promptly to prevent the spread of disease. Throughout the growing season, feed the iceberg lettuce plants with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Encourage healthy growth by providing proper nutrition and maintaining a consistent watering schedule. After approximately 70 to 85 days from the initial planting of the seeds, your iceberg lettuce should be ready for harvest. Check for maturity by gently squeezing the lettuce head; it should feel firm and compact. To harvest the lettuce, use a sharp knife to cut the head off at its base, leaving the roots intact in the soil to encourage continuous growing for the second harvest. By following these detailed steps for growing iceberg lettuce, you can enjoy fresh, crisp, and healthy iceberg lettuce from your garden."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Possible answers: i. yes ii. it is not possible to tell iii. no","completion":"iii. No The premise and the hypothesis do not entail one another. The concept of 'entailment' in logic requires that the truth of the first statement (the premise) inevitably leads to the truth of the second statement (the hypothesis). This is not the case between the premise \\"Opera-Garnier and the Grands Boulevards\\" and the hypothesis \\"The Grands Boulevards and Opera-Garnier.\\" Before delving into why the premise does not entail the hypothesis, let's first understand a bit about these two iconic locations in Paris, France. Opera-Garnier, also known as Palais Garnier, is a 1,979-seat opera house built from 1861 to 1875 for the Paris Opera. On the other hand, the Grands Boulevards are a chain of wide boulevards that traverse part of the French capital. They were constructed in the 17th century on the orders of Louis XIV to replace the old city walls. Now back to the entailment. The two statements are essentially structurally and semantically identical, but they are inverted. This inversion, however, does not alter the meaning of these sentences. You're still talking about the same two landmarks in Paris. Yet, that doesn't mean one statement automatically implies the truth of the other, as the order of the two landmarks in the sentence doesn't matter. In the premise, the Opera-Garnier is mentioned before the Grands Boulevards, while in the hypothesis, the Grands Boulevards is mentioned before the Opera-Garnier. It doesn't change anything about the factuality or the relatedness of these two places. Thus, these statements are symmetrical rather than consequential or inferential. The premise does not directly lead to the hypothesis or vice versa; the truth of one does not necessitate the truth of the other. Consequently, the answer is \\"No\\" the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the specific technique whose association with commercial mass production partly led the Japanese art establishment to frown upon it? , can you please find it? The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country. In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences. Prominent artists included Goyō Hashiguchi, called the \\"Utamaro of the Taishō period\\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui Itō, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes. Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.Artists of the sōsaku-hanga (\\"creative prints\\") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997). These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional...

Answer the following question: when did rome switch from latin to italian?","completion":"To answer the question, I will gather historical information about the transition from Latin to Italian in Rome. Step 1: Research the historical origins of Latin and Italian. Latin originated in the Italian Peninsula and became the official language of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. Over time, as the Roman Empire expanded, Latin evolved and influenced various vernacular languages throughout its territories. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Latin continued to be used by scholars and the Church. Italian is a Romance language that was derived from Vulgar Latin, the everyday spoken language of ancient Rome. It developed throughout the Middle Ages as various regional dialects emerged in the Italian Peninsula. Step 2: Identify key events influencing the change from Latin to Italian. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD marked the decline of Latin as the official language of the empire. The emergence of regional dialects, influenced by local cultures, and the subsequent formation of various city-states in the Italian Peninsula contributed to the development of the Italian language. Step 3: Determine in which period Italian was recognized as a distinct language. Dante Alighieri, who lived in the 13th and 14th centuries, is often considered the father of the Italian language. His most famous work, \\"The Divine Comedy,\\" was written in the Tuscan dialect of Italian. Dante's work was instrumental in elevating the vernacular language to a literary status and solidifying the basis for modern Italian. Considering this information, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact date for when Rome switched from Latin to Italian. The transition from Latin to Italian was a gradual process that occurred over centuries, and it varied across different regions of the Italian Peninsula. However, we can say that this transition began taking place more significantly after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and became prominent by the time of Dante Alighieri in the late Middle Ages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Following Jenkins' testimony and petitions from other West Indies merchants, the opposition in Parliament voted on 28 March 1738 to send \\"an Address\\" to the King, asking his Majesty to seek redress from Spain. More than one year later, all diplomatic means having been exhausted, on 10 July 1739 King George II authorised the Admiralty Board to seek maritime reprisals against Spain. On 20 July, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon and a fleet of warships departed Britain, bound for the West Indies, to attack Spanish ships and \\"possessions\\". War was not declared against Spain until Saturday, 23 October 1739 , one day after the attack on La Guaira, the principal port of the Province of Venezuela, which was controlled by the Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas. After arriving at the island of Antigua in early October 1739, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sent three ships under the command of Captain Thomas Waterhouse to intercept Spanish merchant ships that made the route between La Guaira and Porto Bello. Waterhouse spotted several small vessels in the port of La Guaira and decided to attack, implementing a rudimentary plan. The governor of the Province of Venezuela, Brigadier Don Gabriel de Zuloaga had prepared the port defences, and Spanish troops were well-commanded by Captain Don Francisco Saucedo. On 22 October, Waterhouse entered the port of La Guaira flying the Spanish flag. Expecting attack, the port gunners were not deceived by his ruse; they waited until the British squadron was within range and then simultaneously opened fire. After three hours of heavy shelling, Waterhouse ordered a withdrawal. The battered British squadron sailed to Jamaica to undertake emergency repairs.

Passage 2:Before recording her debut album, Spears had originally envisioned it in the style of \\"Sheryl Crow music, but younger [and] more adult contemporary\\". However, the singer agreed with her label's appointment of producers, who had the objective to reach a teen public at the time. She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded the spring of 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. \\"Sometimes\\" was written by Jörgen Elofsson, and produced by Per Magnusson and David Kreuger. Spears recorded the vocals for the song in May 1998, at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It was also mixed at Cheiron Studios by Martin. Esbjörn Öhrwall played the acoustic guitar, while bass guitar was done by Thomas Lindberg. Keyboards and programming was done by Kreuger, and additional keyboards by Magnusson. Background vocals were provided by Anders von Hoffsten. Spears also co-wrote and recorded a track called \\"I'm So Curious\\", produced by Eric Foster White, that was released as a B-side to \\"Sometimes\\". The track was recorded in 1997 at 4MW East Studios in New Jersey. \\"Sometimes\\" was released as the second single from ...Baby One More Time on April 30, 1999. Passage 3:In August 1991, hard-line Communists launched a coup against Gorbachev; while the coup quickly fell apart, it broke the remaining power of Gorbachev and the central Soviet government. Later that month, Gorbachev resigned as general secretary of the Communist party, and Russian president Boris Yeltsin ordered the seizure of Soviet property. Gorbachev clung to power as the President of the Soviet Union until December 1991, when the Soviet Union dissolved. Fifteen states emerged from the Soviet Union, and of those states, Russia was the largest and most populous. Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992, declaring a new era of \\"friendship and partnership\\". In January 1993, Bush and Yeltsin agreed to START II, which provided for further nuclear arms reductions on top of the original START treaty. The collapse of the Soviet Union prompted reflections on the future of the world following the end of the Cold War; one political scientist, Francis Fukuyama, speculated that humanity had reached the \\"end of history\\" in that liberal, capitalist democracy had permanently triumphed over Communism and fascism. Meanwhile, the collapse of the Soviet Union and other Communist governments led to post-Soviet conflicts in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Africa that would continue long after Bush left office.

Q:Q: An elastic collision is one that conserves internal energy of what type? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: 8.4 Elastic Collisions in One Dimension Let us consider various types of two-object collisions. These collisions are the easiest to analyze, and they illustrate many of the physical principles involved in collisions. The conservation of momentum principle is very useful here, and it can be used whenever the net external force on a system is zero. We start with the elastic collision of two objects moving along the same line—a one-dimensional problem. An elastic collision is one that also conserves internal kinetic energy. Internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the system. Figure 8.6 illustrates an elastic collision in which internal kinetic energy and momentum are conserved. Truly elastic collisions can only be achieved with subatomic particles, such as electrons striking nuclei. Macroscopic collisions can be very nearly, but not quite, elastic—some kinetic energy is always converted into other forms of energy such as heat transfer due to friction and sound. One macroscopic collision that is nearly elastic is that of two steel blocks on ice. Another nearly elastic collision is that between two carts with spring bumpers on an air track. Icy surfaces and air tracks are nearly frictionless, more readily allowing nearly elastic collisions on them. Elastic Collision An elastic collision is one that conserves internal kinetic energy.

Question: The answer to the question: Andy Kelp seeks his brother-in-law to aid in a job for who? is inside the article: After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

Who wrote the songs for the classic film 'Oklahoma'?","completion":"The songs for the classic film 'Oklahoma!' were written by the esteemed composer Richard Rodgers and celebrated lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II, who together formed one of the most notable musical partnerships in American history. 'Oklahoma!' marked the start of their collaboration, and the duo went on to create numerous successful musicals renowned for their memorable songs and engaging storytelling. 'Oklahoma!' was originally a stage musical that premiered on Broadway in 1943, and the 1955 film adaptation was helmed by director Fred Zinnemann. The story is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931 play 'Green Grow the Lilacs,' and the musical successfully adapts the play by using this source material as the foundation for its storytelling. Set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 1900s, the plot revolves around two pairs of romantic interests: cowboy Curly McLain and farm girl Laurey Williams, as well as cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious love interest, Ado Annie Carnes. The show is celebrated for its innovative integration of music and lyrics with character development and narrative progression. Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs deftly navigate a range of musical styles, from soaring ballads to lively dance numbers. The memorable soundtrack features beloved classics such as 'Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin',' 'The Surrey with the Fringe on Top,' 'People Will Say We're in Love,' 'Kansas City,' and the rousing title song, 'Oklahoma.' The stage musical was a milestone in the genre, as it helped to transform the American musical theater landscape by introducing a more cohesive, integrated approach to storytelling, thereby moving beyond the loosely connected songs and scenes typical of earlier musicals. The film adaptation remained faithful to the vision and impact of the original stage production, capturing the essence of both its music and narrative. In conclusion, the iconic songs for the classic film 'Oklahoma!' were written by the legendary duo of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Their collaborative work became a pivotal force in American musical theater, and 'Oklahoma!' remains a testament to their remarkable talents as composer and lyricist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: In chemistry and physics , Dalton's law (also called Dalton's law of partial pressures) states that the total pressure exerted by the mixture of non-reactive gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of individual gases. Question: What were the problems with Dalton's original laws? Answer:","completion":"Dalton's law of partial pressures has been a fundamental concept in chemistry and physics since its introduction. However, despite its great importance, there were some limitations and problems associated with Dalton's original laws, which evolved over time in response to scientific advancements and a better understanding of gas behavior. Some of the issues were: 1. Limited to ideal gases: One of the primary issues with Dalton's law is that it is based solely on ideal gas behavior, which assumes that the molecules of a gas have negligible volume and no intermolecular forces. This idealization is not valid in real gas systems, especially at high pressures and low temperatures, where the volume of gas molecules and intermolecular forces become significant. Consequently, the law fails to accurately describe the behavior of real gas mixtures under these conditions. 2. Inapplicable to reactive gases: Although Dalton's law holds true for non-reactive gases, it is not accurate for mixtures containing reactive gases. When gases react chemically, their individual partial pressures may change due to the formation of new compounds or the consumption of reactants, invalidating the assumption that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of individual gases. 3. Incomplete account for non-ideal behavior: The original formulation of Dalton's law does not comprehensively address deviations from ideal gas behavior. Van der Waals, a Dutch physicist, later improved our understanding of this limitation in gas behavior by introducing the Van der Waals equation. This equation applies corrections for gas molecule volume and intermolecular forces and provides a more accurate description of real gas systems. 4. Ignorance of molecular collisions: Dalton's law assumes that gas molecules move in straight lines between collisions with the container walls and do not interact with each other. However, this is an oversimplification for real gases, as molecules do collide with one another, which influences gas behavior and properties. The kinetic-molecular theory of gases, developed later, offers a more comprehensive understanding of gas behavior by considering molecular collisions in its descriptions. 5. Influence of gas dissolution: Dalton's law does not account for the possibility of gas dissolution in liquids, such as when different gases dissolve in blood. This phenomenon can affect the gas behavior and properties, leading to potential deviations from the predictions of Dalton's law. Despite these limitations and problems associated with Dalton's original laws, they have made significant contributions to the scientific understanding of gas behavior. Many advancements (such as the Van der Waals equation and the kinetic-molecular theory) have built upon this foundation, helping refine and extend our knowledge of gases and their properties. In conclusion, Dalton's law of partial pressures is an essential concept that has aided the development of chemistry and physics, while recognizing its limitations has led to further research and improved understanding of gas behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - viral - toxic - bacterial - pathogenic A: Answer:","completion":"Parasitic fungi that cause diseases in plants are considered pathogenic. Pathogenic fungi are a type of microorganism that can infect and harm their host, in this case, plants. These fungi can often negatively impact plant growth, development, and crop productivity, leading to significant agricultural losses. Although viruses, bacteria, and toxins can also cause diseases in plants, these terms do not best describe the nature of parasitic fungi. - Viral: A term used to describe diseases caused by viruses, which are small infectious agents that can only replicate inside living cells of organisms. While some plant diseases are indeed caused by viruses, this does not categorize parasitic fungi as they are distinct and separate types of pathogens. - Toxic: Toxins refer to substances produced by certain microorganisms, plants, or animals that can cause harm to other organisms. Some parasitic fungi can produce toxic compounds called mycotoxins that can contaminate crops and be harmful to humans and animals if consumed. However, not all parasitic fungi produce toxins, so this term does not encompass all disease-causing fungi. - Bacterial: This term pertains to diseases caused by bacteria, which are single-celled microorganisms with a simple cellular structure. Bacterial plant pathogens are another group of organisms that can cause plant diseases, but they are different from parasitic fungi. In conclusion, the most appropriate term to describe parasitic fungi that cause diseases in plants is \\"pathogenic.\\" These pathogenic fungi can have a significant impact on agricultural productivity, plant health, and the overall ecosystem. As a result, researchers and farmers are continually working on methods to control and prevent plant fungal diseases, such as the development of resistant crop varieties and the use of fungicides."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: When was the songwriter of the song by The Beach boys refering to the Maraishi born?

Only one song is listed as performed by Bamboleo. I did not open the CD. So I do not know if the Bamboleo listed there is really the aforementioned Cuban band.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What group of people were the most abundant in Brazil in 1872? , can you please find it? White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"Ann may spends her vacation in Italy.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist, a specialist in languages, may consider the sentence \\"Ann may spends her vacation in Italy.\\" as linguistically less acceptable due to several reasons. It contains a mix of grammatical errors and presents an unconventional auxiliary verb usage that violates the standard English language rules. Here's a detailed analysis of why this sentence might be deemed unacceptable by a linguist: 1. Tense and Subject-Verb Agreement Error: In English, grammatical rules dictate that the verb form should agree with the subject in number and person. Here, the subject \\"Ann\\" is singular and in the third person. The verb \\"spends\\" agrees with the subject in number and person as its -s ending indicates singular, third-person form. However, the auxiliary verb \\"may\\" is also included in the sentence, which leads to an inconsistency in tense usage. Correcting the sentence to utilize only the modal auxiliary verb \\"may\\" will yield either of these two examples: a. \\"Ann may spend her vacation in Italy.\\" - Here, we use the base form \\"spend\\" as required after modal auxiliaries (e.g. may, might, can, could, etc.) and the information conveys a possibility or uncertainty. b. \\"Ann spends her vacation in Italy.\\" - Without \\"may,\\" this sentence implies a habitual action or general truth. 2. Redundant and Unconventional Auxiliary Verb Usage: The combination of modal auxiliary verb \\"may\\" and the present simple verb \\"spends\\" in the given sentence is unconventional. When using a modal auxiliary verb, it should be followed by the main verb's base form, like \\"spend,\\" not its inflected form, like \\"spends.\\" In English, auxiliary verbs have specific functions, and the choice of auxiliary verb affects the meaning of the sentence. The use of \\"may\\" plays a crucial role in determining whether the sentence is talking about a possibility or permission, while \\"spends\\" on its own conveys a more definitive meaning. Combining both verbs in their current forms goes against standard English rules. 3. Capitalization Issue: Although it might be considered a minor issue in terms of linguistic acceptability, it's still worth mentioning that the first letter of the word \\"Italy\\" should be capitalized. Proper nouns, such as the names of countries, should always be capitalized in English. To summarize, a linguist would probably deem the sentence \\"Ann may spends her vacation in Italy.\\" as linguistically less acceptable due to tense inconsistencies, unconventional auxiliary verb usage, and a capitalization issue. Correcting these issues in line with standard English rules would yield more acceptable and clearer sentences like \\"Ann may spend her vacation in Italy.\\" or \\"Ann spends her vacation in Italy.\\" depending on the intended meaning."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer the following question: Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).

As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - Lava Ground is the debut album from Jamaican reggae artist I Wayne.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America). - I Wayne, Rastafarian stage name for Cliffroy Taylor (born 1980 in Portmore, Jamaica), is a roots reggae singer. He is known for his hit singles \\"Living In Love\\" and \\"Can't Satisfy Her\\" from his debut album, \\"Lava Ground\\". - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent.

His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification.

When someone is happy,can you smell it? You can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org. For the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period. Those sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents. Researchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them. \\"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey. This is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings. Researchers have yet to isolate exactly what the chemical compound for the happiness smell is,but you might imagine what the potential... Question: What is the main finding of the new research? - Men produce more sweats. - Negative emotions have a smell. - Pleasant feelings can be smelt out. - Women have a better sense of smell.

Seattle Slew (February 15, 1974 - May 7, 2002) was an American Thoroughbred race horse who won the Triple Crown in 1977--the tenth of twelve horses to accomplish the feat. He is the only horse to have won the Triple Crown while having been undefeated in any race previous. Honored as the 1977 Horse of the Year, he was also a champion at age two, three and four. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth. Seattle Slew stood at stud at Spendthrift Farm in Lexington for seven years, before moving to Three Chimneys Farm in Midway in 1985. He was the leading sire of 1984, when his son Swale (who died later that year) won the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. His other progeny include the talented, ill-fated 1982 champion two-year-old filly, Landaluce, Slew o' Gold (winner of the 1983 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the 1984 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Male Horse), 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy and the 2000 champion three-year-old filly Surfside. He is part of a unique three generation sequence of Belmont Stakes Winners: Seattle Slew (1977) - A.P. Indy (1992) - Rags to Riches (2004). The primary conduit for Seattle Slew's continuation of his male line has been through A.P. Indy. A.P. Indy has done well at stud in Kentucky, siring (among others) the 2003 Horse of the Year, Mineshaft. One of Seattle Slew's most successful grandsons is the California champion Lava Man (sired by Slew City Slew). In 2006, Lava Man became the first horse to win the Santa Anita Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic Stakes in the same year. Seattle Slew was also a leading broodmare sire, his daughters producing (among others) Cigar (leading North American money-earner of his day). Races in honor of his dam, My Charmer, include the My Charmer Handicap held at Florida's Calder Race Course annually and the My Charmer Stakes held at Kentucky's Turfway Park. Rags to Riches, a granddaughter, won the 2007 Belmont Stakes - the third filly to win the race, after Ruthless in 1867 and Tanya in 1905. The victory earned jockey John Velazquez and trainer Todd Pletcher their first wins in any Triple Crown race. Rags To Riches was the 22nd filly to run in the Belmont. In 2002, ESPN telecast a \\"SportsCentury\\" on Seattle Slew. In 2014, Seattle Slew's great-great grandson, California Chrome, won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. California Chrome was the second Kentucky Derby winner in a row who was a sire-line descendant of Seattle Slew, following Orb in 2013. California Chrome's bid for the Triple Crown was defeated by another great-grandson of Seattle Slew, Tonalist, by leading sire Tapit. Tapit also sired the winners of the 2016 and 2017 Belmont Stakes, Creator and Tapwrit respectively. 25 years to the day after he won the Kentucky Derby, Seattle Slew died in his sleep at age 28. He was buried whole, the highest honor for a winning race horse, in the courtyard at Hill 'N' Dale Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, with his favorite blanket and a bag of peppermints which he liked to eat. Three Chimneys Farm erected a statue of Seattle Slew near the stallion barn in his honor. Since fellow Triple Crown winner and rival Affirmed had died the year before, he was the sole living Triple Crown winner. At the horse's death, there were no living Triple Crown winners for the first time since Sir Barton won the first Triple Crown in 1919. This phenomenon continued until American Pharoah's Triple Crown in 2015. When did he retire?","completion":"Seattle Slew retired from racing in 1978. After an impressive career that included winning the Triple Crown in 1977, he was retired to stud where his legacy continued to thrive. Seattle Slew's retirement was marked by fanfare due to his remarkable contributions to horse racing. In his short career spanning over three years, he raced in seventeen competitions, winning fourteen of them, finishing second in two, and coming fourth in one. The earnings from his racing career reached over 1.2 million. He completed his final race on October 14, 1978, at the Marlboro Cup Handicap in Belmont Park where he placed second. This race came after his comeback victory in the Woodward Stakes, at the same venue, a race many consider one of his finest due to the high quality of competition it involved. Although his racing career was over, his impact on horse racing continued long into his retirement. His successful stud career as a sire of champion racehorses well supplemented his impressive racing record. He sired over 100 stakes winners, including several champions like A.P. Indy, who became a successful sire himself. The horse's exceptional traits as both a racer and a sire established him as one of the most influential horses in the breeding industry and earned him a place in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1981. He continued to sire notable foals up until his death in 2002, and his progeny still influences the sport of horse racing to date. Seattle Slew's bloodline, bound to his prolific racing career, ensures that he will never be forgotten in the world of thoroughbred racing."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Ron, a sociologist, traveled to two very different societies, society A and society B, for several months each and wrote down his observations. Ron is now examining the data he gathered from the two societies in an attempt to draw scientific conclusions, and write up a paper. In society A, he found that there were high levels of income inequality, while society B had low levels of income inequality. In which society will there be greater community involvement? A:","completion":"To determine in which society there will be greater community involvement, we must first understand various factors that can potentially influence community involvement. Although there are observable differences in income inequality between society A and society B, it is crucial to consider other aspects of the societies, such as cultural values, norms, and social systems. In society A, with high levels of income inequality, there is a larger gap between the rich and the poor. This economic disparity can impact the community involvement in a few ways. On one hand, the inequality can lead to social issues such as increased crime rates, feelings of powerlessness among the lower-income groups, and weakened social cohesion. In extreme cases, this may result in lesser community involvement, as individuals might struggle for their survival or be preoccupied with their personal issues. On the other hand, the contrasting economic reality among community members can also serve as a catalyst for change. Individuals or groups with more resources may feel the desire to support their less fortunate neighbors, leading to greater engagement in community projects, volunteering efforts, and welfare programs. If society A values social equality, community leaders and organizations could create programs that bring people together across class lines, thus fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility for community upliftment. In society B, low levels of income inequality suggest that there is a more even distribution of resources among members. This could result in a stronger social fabric and a sense of shared purpose in community projects. With a more uniform distribution of resources, members may be able to devote time and effort to improving their communities. Additionally, lower income inequality could lead to higher levels of trust among community members, fostering relationships based on mutual respect and understanding, and subsequently, higher community involvement. However, it is essential to recognize that other factors, such as cultural values, norms, and the overall socioeconomic conditions in society B, can still have a significant influence on community involvement. For instance, if individualism is highly valued in the society or if people are overly reliant on government support, community participation might be less likely to thrive, regardless of income equality. To conclude, while limited data is available, it is not entirely possible to predict which society will have greater community involvement solely based on income inequality. Factors such as cultural values, social norms, and individual motivations can significantly impact participation in community programs and initiatives. Therefore, it is essential for Ron, as a sociologist, to consider these elements alongside his findings on income inequality while drawing scientific conclusions and writing up his paper."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After a few threats and some fighting he collects the debt. He dozes during a jet flight back to Hong Kong and the viewer sees in flashback how he got in a fight in the Casino when he was on leave from the US Army and ended up befriending David's father, Sam (David Opatoshu).Josh goes to the casino upon his arrival in Hong Kong and checks in the money. While he's there, David asks him to help terminate one of the Dragon's dealers who is skimming money. David fires the dealer, telling him he's lucky he doesn't have his hands broken for what he's done. The dealer is humiliated by being forced to walk out of the casino without his pants, a punishment Josh considers excessively harsh.After work, Josh visits Sam, and the two share some reminiscences about the old days. Sam asks Josh what is going on with David and the casino, saying his gut tells him that something is wrong. However, Josh has not been taken into David's confidence and doesn't know what to say.

Help as much as you can. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who does the psychologest give a dilemma to? Donald's Dilemma starts with Daisy narrating her problem to an unseen psychologist through flashback scenes. Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. He regained consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. His singing voice was improved to the degree in which it sounds identical to Frank Sinatra. However, Donald had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head, while in front of a table of other different suicidal methods, including a noose, a grenade, a bomb, a knife, and poison. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so. That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon. At the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or Daisy regains Donald but the world loses him. Posed with the question \\"her or the world\\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - \\"Me! Me! Me! MEEE!!\\". Soon, Donald returns to his old self and forgets about his singing career and Daisy regains her lover.","completion":"The psychologist gives a dilemma to Daisy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In the Roman Catholic Church, obstinate and willful manifest heresy is considered to spiritually cut one off from the Church, even before excommunication is incurred. The Codex Justinianus (1:5:12) defines \\"everyone who is not devoted to the Catholic Church and to our Orthodox holy Faith\\" a heretic. The Church had always dealt harshly with strands of Christianity that it considered heretical, but before the 11th century these tended to centre around individual preachers or small localised sects, like Arianism, Pelagianism, Donatism, Marcionism and Montanism. The diffusion of the almost Manichaean sect of Paulicians westwards gave birth to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies of Western Europe. The first one was that of Bogomils in modern day Bosnia, a sort of sanctuary between Eastern and Western Christianity. By the 11th century, more organised groups such as the Patarini, the Dulcinians, the Waldensians and the Cathars were beginning to appear in the towns and cities of northern Italy, southern France and Flanders. Question: What group moved westward to give rise to the famous 11th and 12th century heresy in western Europe?","completion":"The group that moved westward to give rise to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies in Western Europe was the Paulicians. They were an almost Manichaean sect, characterized by their dualist beliefs, originating in the Eastern Byzantine Empire. As the Paulicians migrated and spread their doctrines towards the West, they influenced the emergence of several heretical movements in Western Europe, including the Bogomils in modern-day Bosnia, who further contributed to the development of various heretical groups in the region. Some of the notable heretical groups that appeared in Western Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries, under the influence of the Paulicians and Bogomils, were the Patarini, the Dulcinians, the Waldensians, and the Cathars. These groups had a significant impact on medieval Christianity and challenged the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church, leading to disputes, persecutions, and efforts to suppress these movements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Elena was no longer a kid . b). Angela was no longer a kid .","completion":"b). Angela was no longer a kid. Angela, Elena's older sister, had always been her biggest inspiration. With an air of confidence and determination that seemed to defy her age, she had managed to carve a path for herself even in the most trying of times. Currently working for a prestigious law firm, Angela had come a long way from the humble beginnings they both shared. And as Elena continued to mature, her admiration for her sister only grew. Growing up in a small, tight-knit family, Elena and Angela had supported each other since they were children. They spent countless hours together, exploring the fields that kissed the edges of their small, two-bedroom house while dreaming of brighter futures. As the years passed, Elena started noticing the strength that Angela possessed – an unwavering resilience that ultimately became Elena's greatest source of admiration. Despite the challenges they faced, including their father losing his job and their mother falling ill, Angela never gave up. Even as her friends succumbed to the despair that swirled around their small town, she threw herself into her studies, determined to achieve a better life for their family. And ultimately, her hard work paid off. Now, as Angela worked as an accomplished lawyer in her thriving career, she had become an icon in their town. Not only had she turned their family's fortune around, but she had also shown the community that it was possible to break free from the shackles of adversity. Elena marveled at Angela's ability to balance work, family, and a personal life, all while making time to support charitable initiatives and mentor young students. As Elena continued to follow in her sister's footsteps, she focused on her studies, particularly excelling in areas like human rights and social justice. These subjects resonated with her, serving as a potent force to propel her on her chosen path. Driven by her sister's success, Elena daydreamed of the day when she, too, could play her part in making the world a better place. However, she was well aware that the road to success was littered with obstacles. But with Angela as her role model, Elena found the inner strength to face any hurdle that came her way. The sisters remained each other's pillars of support, discussing lofty goals and dreams, and navigating the storms of life together. On a chilly autumn evening, Elena found herself walking home from school with a thick envelope clutched in her hands. Her heart raced as a feeling of both excitement and fear coursed through her veins. Seated at their small wooden table, with her family gathered around, she carefully opened the envelope and pulled out the letter inside. Her eyes scanned the words, barely able to breathe. \\"We're pleased to inform you that you've been accepted into the pre-law program at our prestigious university,\\" read Elena aloud, her voice trembling with emotion. Angela hugged Elena tightly, tears pricking the corners of her eyes. Their father, looking proud beyond measure, squeezed his daughters' hands, while their mother wiped away tears. It was a moment Elena knew she would cherish for the rest of her life. As Elena strived to be just like Angela, she began to learn the importance of forging her own path. In the end, Elena realized it was not her sister's achievements that mattered most, but rather the spirit and perseverance that had brought Angela to where she was today. That was the driving force Elena wanted to emulate as she embarked on her own journey into adulthood. With her sister serving as her beacon of hope and inspiration, Elena knew she was destined to leave her own mark on the world. Together, they would fight for justice and equality – one case at a time. And when Elena finally stood beside Angela as a fellow lawyer, they would make their family proud and show that hope always prevails, even in the darkest of times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose research at St. Helens formed the basis for his doctoral dissertation? , can you please find it? Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field.

Tweet: @rainnwilson aww - you just got vanquished Choices: *negative; *positive;","completion":"Answer: *positive; The sentiment of the given tweet is positive. To analyze the tweet in detail, let's break it down: 1. \\"@rainnwilson\\": The tweet is directed at Rainn Wilson, an actor, and comedian, who is best known for his role as Dwight Schrute in the TV series \\"The Office.\\" This reference to a celebrity is a neutral element but sets a context for the tweet's content. 2. \\"aww\\": This term is typically a textual representation of a sentimental or warm reaction to something that a person perceives as cute, lovely, or sweet. In this context, the use of \\"aww\\" suggests that the tweeter has a positive or affectionate emotional response to the event described in the rest of the tweet. 3. \\"you just got vanquished\\": The word \\"vanquished\\" has a generally negative connotation, as it means being defeated or overcome. But in this context, the use of \\"aww\\" before \\"you just got vanquished\\" indicates playful sarcasm or friendly teasing instead of genuine negativity. The tweeter acknowledges Rainn Wilson getting \\"vanquished\\" as if it might be cute or endearing rather than genuinely upsetting or disappointing. Putting all these elements together, the sentiment of the tweet is positive. While the term \\"vanquished\\" could suggest negativity at a cursory glance, the use of \\"aww\\" and the tweet's overall tone indicate that this is a playful, friendly, and positive sentiment.

Therefore, the correct answer to the multi-choice problem is: a). different meanings To explain further, let's take a closer look at each sentence and break down their contextual meanings. Sentence 1: The swiftest of foot. In this sentence, \\"foot\\" is used to denote a person's ability or skill in activities relating to the feet, such as running or walking. So, \\"The swiftest of foot\\" refers to someone who is exceptionally fast or agile in these physical activities, like a runner or an athlete. Sentence 2: He followed on foot. In this instance, \\"foot\\" is used to imply the mode of transportation someone uses. \\"He followed on foot\\" means that the person chose to walk or run instead of using other means like a vehicle or a bicycle. In this case, \\"foot\\" represents the act of walking or running as a means of travel or commuting and does not indicate the skill or speed at which the activity is being performed. In conclusion, the word \\"foot\\" has different meanings in these two sentences as it refers to the skill or ability associated with one's feet in Sentence 1, while it signifies the mode of transportation, specifically walking or running, in Sentence 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Paragraph: Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches?

Hate crimes can overlap with terrorism, but not always, said Chuck Strozier, director of the Center on Terrorism at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \\"Racist motivations are not necessarily political,\\" Strozier said, \\"unless you find on his computer that he's been going to neo-Nazi websites and seeing the violence and read right-wing propaganda.\\" Under that scenario, Strozier said, the bombings could be seen as \\"a process that would lead to a greater race war.\\" \\"Then I think there would be no question of whether it would be appropriate to start talking about it as terrorism,\\" he said. Mark Anthony Conditt Austin Community College Even without evidence of that kind, there have been growing demands to call Conditt a terrorist. On Monday, before Conditt was publicly identified as a suspect, three members of the Congressional Black Caucus requested in a joint statement that the bombings be classified as \\"ongoing terrorist attacks.\\" A day later, University of Texas at Austin police Chief David Carter told The Dallas Morning News that \\"whatever you call it, technically under federal law or anything, it is clearly a terrorist act.\\" After it was revealed that the man behind the bombings was white, the calls grew louder. Pakistani-American comedian Kumail Nanjiani tweeted, \\"If this terrorist bomber was a brown guy, my mom wouldn’t be able to leave her house for a week.\\" And political comedian Tim Young tweeted: \\"Did anyone call the Austin Bomber a domestic terrorist? Terrorists come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and religions.\\" The calls for Conditt to be considered a terrorist follow criticism of how and when President Donald Trump has used the word \\"terrorism\\" in the past. Critics say he has been quick to use the word when suspects are Muslim, but appears reluctant to use it otherwise. Those concerns peaked last August, when members of Trump's own party, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., slammed Trump for not calling a deadly confrontation at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, \\"domestic terrorism.\\" In the case of the Austin bombings, the White House said this week that the attacks did not appear to be terrorism. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted Tuesday that Trump was mourning the victims and added, \\"There is no apparent nexus to terrorism at this time.\\" \\"We don't know if he did it out of a political agenda, so he meets the definition of terrorism on every level — except the motivation.\\" \\"We don't know if he did it out of a political agenda, so he meets the definition of terrorism on every level — except the motivation.\\" For Ami Pedahzur, a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has written extensively about terrorism, the bombings that paralyzed his hometown these past few weeks have felt a lot like terrorism — even if officials haven't called it that. \\"Basically when we talk about terrorism, we look at something that is politically motivated but is aimed at generating fear among people and altering their behavior,\\" Pedahzur said in a phone interview from Austin. \\"We are feeling terrified opening packages.\\" \\"In terms of [the bomber's] impact on everyday life here in town, it's absolutely terrorizing,\\" he added. \\"We don't know if he did it out of a political agenda, so he meets the definition of terrorism on every level — except the motivation.\\" ||||| The man who killed two people and wounded five others with a series of bomb attacks in the Austin area left an audio recording for police that includes a haunting revelation about himself. “I wish I were sorry but I am not,” Mark Conditt said in the cell phone recording, according to sources familiar with his statements. He described himself as a “psychopath” and said he feels as though he has been disturbed since childhood. Conditt also promised that he would go inside a crowded McDonald’s to blow himself up if he thought authorities were closing in on him, according to law enforcement sources briefed on the contents of the audio. The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak about the recording, which police are using as evidence in the case. Interim Police Chief Brian Manley confirmed the existence of the audio in a news conference Wednesday, but provided limited details about its specifics. He called it a “confession.” Police say Conditt, 23, detonated a bomb inside his car as officers closed in on him along Interstate 35. He had a laptop computer with him that was destroyed in the blast, but officials say they think it may have contained other recordings. According to the sources, he began his 28-minute statement, which was recorded after 9 p.m. on Tuesday, saying “it’s me again” and blamed himself for helping investigators find him by going into a FedEx store on Brodie Lane in Sunset Valley to mail two explosive devices, one of which blew up at a transfer facility in Schertz. That decision, Conditt realized, allowed him to be captured on video cameras inside the store and for outside cameras to snap photographs of his license plate, which authorities used to learn his identity. Conditt also acknowledged that he recognized his actions left family members without loved ones, and caused permanent injuries to other victims, including an elderly woman, but said little else about them. The sources also repeated what Manley said at the news conference: That Conditt gave no hint about how or why he chose the targets of the bomb attacks. ||||| Austin, Texas (CNN) When the Austin bomber went to a FedEx store Sunday to ship two more of his package bombs, he made the mistake of parking within view of a surveillance camera, a US congressman told CNN. The license plate of Mark Anthony Conditt's red Ford SUV could be seen on video and police used the images to begin tracking the killer, Rep. Michael McCaul, whose district includes the town where the bomber lived, said Thursday. Eventually authorities were able to monitor Conditt's location by pinpointing where his cellphone was being used, McCaul said. While Conditt's motive remains a mystery, McCaul said the bomber talked on a 25-minute confession video about his despondence over his difficulty with employment and other \\"aggravating factors.\\" The bomber expressed no remorse for killing two people and wounding five, McCaul said. The congressman said Conditt spoke matter-of-factly. The bomber had a list of addresses on a device that authorities recovered. The list, McCaul said, has been mischaracterized in media reports as a target list. The congressman said he didn't know whether they were potential targets or whether the addresses were linked. Law enforcement has cleared those sites, he said. The bomber bought several \\"Slow Down Children At Play\\" signs at a Home Depot, which McCaul thinks means Conditt was planning more attacks using trip wires. Police tell public to stay vigilant Conditt recorded what police labeled as a confession the night before he died, as if he knew authorities were closing in on him. He died after a final explosion in an encounter with police early Wednesday, ending the wave of bombings that terrorized Austin for almost three weeks. But the evidence that investigators have gathered has given them few, if any, clues as to what motivated the 23-year-old man to embark on his spree of violence. \\"It is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his life that led him to this point,\\" interim Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said of the video. \\"I know everybody is interested in a motive and understanding why. And we're never going to be able to put a (rationale) behind these acts.\\" Questions remain, too, about what Conditt's intentions were beyond Wednesday, had he lived. Authorities who've searched his home said they've found no other finished bombs, but Austin police asked the public Thursday to \\" remain vigilant and report anything suspicious .\\" A confession video The 25-minute recording was found on Conditt's cellphone when police recovered his body Wednesday morning. In his confession, Conditt described the components of seven bombs he built -- including, authorities believe, the one he used to kill himself -- and detailed the differences among the devices, Manley said. But the video failed to shed light on a possible motive. He did not make any references suggesting involvement with terror groups or that the bombings were hate crimes, Manley said. Mark Anthony Conditt Search of bomber's house Federal agents searched the home that Conditt shared with at least two people. SWAT vans, robots and dozens of officers in tactical uniforms flooded the streets of Pflugerville, a suburb of about 50,000 people north of Austin. Inside a room, agents found components for making similar bombs to the ones that exploded in the past few weeks, said Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' Houston office. Agents did not find any finished bombs, Milanowski said. Authorities surround the home of Austin bomber Mark Conditt in Pflugerville, Texas, on Wednesday. The devices that exploded in Austin and near San Antonio were pipe bombs with batteries and smokeless powder and were constructed with materials found in a hardware or sporting goods store, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN The bombs had distinctive shrapnel inside. Some had \\"mousetrap\\" switches and others had \\"clothespin\\" switches, the source said. Frank Alvarado and his two children were among those asked to evacuate homes and businesses within five blocks of Conditt's home as agents removed explosive materials. \\"You would never think it's going to happen over here because everything was happening down south,\\" Alvarado told CNN affiliate KXAN. \\"You never think it's this close to home -- I'm just two blocks away.\\" Pink gloves, receipts led police to suspect Knowing that all the bombs were made from common household items, investigators hit area stores, scanning receipts and looking for suspicious purchases. The search provided authorities with enough evidence to consider Conditt a \\"person of interest.\\" Then surveillance footage from a FedEx store south of Austin captured a man in a baseball cap, blond wig and pink gloves bringing two packages to the store. Investigators used cellphone technology Tuesday night to track Conditt to a hotel parking lot in Round Rock, about 20 miles north of downtown Austin. There, they spotted his vehicle. Police and federal agents gathered outside the hotel but didn't move in immediately. They wanted to wait for backup because they were dealing with a suspected serial bomber. They were awaiting the arrival of those teams when, some time later, Conditt took off in his vehicle. Police followed him as he drove on a service road along Interstate 35 until they forced him to stop on the side of the road. As a SWAT team cautiously approached, Conditt detonated a device inside his red SUV and died in the blast. Questions for his roommates Conditt's two roommates were detained and questioned by police as investigators tried to determine if he acted alone. Police said one of the roommates was released Wednesday and one was free to go on Thursday. They were not arrested, and neither roommate was publicly identified. Jennifer Withers said her son moved to Conditt's three-bedroom home after a friend told him about a room for lease. In the three months that her son has lived at the Pflugerville house, Withers said she never saw Conditt and that her son didn't express any concerns. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"This news article is about a person named Mark Conditt who made and sent bombs to people in Austin, Texas. The bombs hurt and scared many people. Some people think Conditt's actions were terrorism, which means using violence and fear to try to control people or achieve a goal. Others say we don't know why he did it, so we shouldn't call it terrorism. The police were able to find and track Conditt using video cameras and his cell phone. When the police tried to catch him, he set off another bomb and died.

Bank ANZ commissioned artists to redesign the machines around the city. Celebrates diversity and equality during the world-renowned celebration. Company have had to defend themselves after being criticised for profiting from civil rights issues. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: ANZ Bank Champions Diversity and Equality Through Artistic ATM Redesign Step 1: Begin the article with a brief introduction of the event. Justification: This will set the stage for the rest of the article and provide context for readers. Opening paragraph: Bank ANZ is taking an innovative approach to celebrating diversity and equality during a world-renowned celebration. They have commissioned local artists to redesign their ATM machines throughout the city, showcasing creative talent while promoting key societal values. However, this move has prompted some criticism, with detractors accusing the company of profiting from civil rights issues. Step 2: Elaborate on the purpose of the artistic makeover. Justification: This will help readers to understand the motives behind the initiative and its connection to diversity and equality. Second paragraph: ANZ's decision to collaborate with artists for the ATM redesign project was driven by a desire to visibly support and celebrate the diverse communities that reside in the city. The bank recognised that a world-renowned celebration was the perfect opportunity to display its commitment to promoting diversity and equality. In putting imaginative designs on their ATMs, ANZ hopes to spark conversations and raise greater awareness around the importance of acceptance and inclusivity. Step 3: Present information about the artists and their creations. Justification: This will provide readers with insight about the creative process and how the art contributes to the theme of diversity and equality. Third paragraph: The artists commissioned for this project represent varied backgrounds, reflecting ANZ's commitment to supporting diversity in every aspect. Each artist has been given creative freedom to express their unique perspective on themes such as love, equality, and unity. As a result, the ATMs have been transformed into colourful, thought-provoking works of art that command attention and encourage reflection. Step 4: Address the criticism faced by ANZ. Justification: This will provide a complete picture of the situation and showcase the differing perspectives surrounding the campaign. Fourth paragraph: Despite the progressive goals of the project, ANZ has faced criticism from those who believe the bank is commercialising and profiting from civil rights issues. Critics argue that the company's actions exploit the messages of equality and diversity, using them mainly as a marketing strategy. While this criticism is worth considering, it is essential to evaluate the overall impact of the project on awareness and discourse about the significance of diversity and inclusivity. Step 5: Conclude the article with a balanced perspective. Justification: This will provide a closure to the readers and allow them to reflect upon the different aspects of the initiative discussed in the article. Conclusion paragraph: While ANZ's artistic ATM redesign project has garnered both praise and criticism, the campaign has indisputably generated conversations about the importance of diversity and equality. It is essential to recognise the value of such initiatives in raising awareness, encouraging broader discussions, and breaking down barriers in society. Ultimately, the weight of the project's contribution to these crucial societal values should be the central aspect under consideration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who set aside the Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo's seized property for his grandson? from the following article ? Queluz's architecture is representative of the final extravagant period of Portuguese culture that followed the discovery of Brazilian gold in 1690. From the beginning of the 18th century many foreign artists and architects were employed in Portugal to satisfy the needs of the newly enriched aristocracy; they brought with them classical ideas of architecture which derived from the Renaissance. In its design, Queluz is a revolt against the earlier, heavier, Italian-influenced Baroque which preceded the Rococo style throughout Europe.Comparisons with the far larger and more Baroque Versailles are unwarranted: Versailles is referred to as having \\"an aura of majesty\\" and it was built and dedicated to exhibit in stone \\"all the glories of France,\\" whereas the far smaller palace at Queluz has been described as \\"exquisite rather than magnificent\\" and looking like \\"a very expensive birthday cake\\". In its frivolity, the architecture of Queluz reflects the lifestyle led by the Portuguese royal family at the time of building: during the reign of Dom Pedro's brother, Joseph I, when Portugal was in practice governed by a valido or favourite, the Marquis of Pombal. Pombal encouraged the royal family to while away their days in the country and leave affairs of state to him. Thus the extravagant, almost whimsical architecture of Queluz, set apart from the capital city, exactly represents the politics and social events of Portugal during this era, and the carefree and flamboyant lives led by its occupants. Queluz's role as a haven for those without responsibility was, however, to be short-lived. On the accession to the throne of Dom Pedro's wife Maria in 1777, Pombal was dismissed, and Dom Pedro and Maria ruled jointly in his place, using the partially completed Rococo palace at Queluz as a retreat from affairs of state in much the same way as Frederick the Great used Europe's other famed Rococo palace, Sanssouci. The site chosen for this summer retreat was in a secluded hollow. It had originally been owned by the Marquis of...

Question: Information: - The Haplogynae are a clade of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. - The Prodidomidae are a spider family with about 300 species in 31 genera. They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders. - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia. - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers. - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea). - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs). - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently . - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica. - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders. - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species. - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic. What entity does 'dionycha' has the relation 'instance of' with?

Article: \\"Teenager\\" is the new term being used in the UK to describe kids at either 8--12 or 10--13 years old. More and more companies are beginning to create products and services for teenagers. The Disney Company sells music and film to teenagers and their parents. You can get everything from lunchboxes and mobile phone covers, to monthly fan magazines and clothing. It's all about sales, which suggests that teenagers must have more money, freedom and influence upon their parents than they've ever had before. Most kids in the UK today get more pocket money than kids did ten years ago. Parents have more money to give their kids than before, since parents are having fewer children. In addition, the divorce rate in the UK is continually rising and parents spend less time with their children than they used to, so many parents try to please their children by buying them presents. It's a bad habit for both parents and kids to get into, but parents are under pressure from commercial marketing and the pleas of their children. UK kids today are very media and computer-literate. A lot of kids have a TV, if not a computer, in their bedrooms. They have easy access to much more information about life and the world. They may have experienced a lot in life as well, since 24% of UK kids live in single-parent families, so people now say that \\"kids are getting older younger\\". With such maturity at such a young age, it's no wonder teenagers are able to influence their parents and have more freedom than previous generations. UK teenagers never used to be worried about spending money on clothes. That's changed. Now, they are much more fashion conscious and concerned about their image . Many of them outgrow the bright colors and fashions of kids years ago and go for something darker and more rebellious . Surely none of the above is a good thing. The UK government is certainly concerned, and for that reason has strict laws preventing companies from marketing their products and services at children.

Despite all of the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, even though the Novak version has a more coherent story line. However: Davis' Mildred's raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute. And it is those raw emotions that constitute *part* of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, of failure, of \\"otherness\\" - strong emotions that he represses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, displays her emotions immediately and without censure. She has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of \\"otherness\\"; rather, she is merely surviving as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. Novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred than was Davis', almost through the the whole movie. Davis' Mildred was **never** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance. And when he reviles her - for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of his love for her - she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen: \\"I wiped my mouth! I WIPED MY MOUTH!!\\" Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis' realism was monumental. IMDb votes concur! Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"Well, little buddy, this review is saying that the person likes the Bette Davis version of the movie better than the Kim Novak version. They think Bette Davis shows more realistic emotions which makes the movie better. So, we can say this review is positive for the Bette Davis version and negative for the Kim Novak version.

Most of these searches have been done over the radio. The hope is that someone in outer space may be trying to get in touch with us. Scientists also have sent radio and television messages on spaceships traveling through space, on the chance that someone may be receptive to such messages. Scientists are using powerful radio telescopes to listen to signals from about 1, 000 stars, all within 100 light years of earth. In addition, they will scan the entire sky to \\"listen\\" for radio messages from more distant stars. Using a computer, they will be able to _ more than eight channels at one time. Scientists are looking for any signal they stands out from the background noise. Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, scientists find that five percent are like our sun. Perhaps half of them have a planet like earth. Such a planet would be a reasonable distance from the star for temperatures to be right for the evolution of life. Based on the inhabitable(that can be lived in)planets in our galaxy, most scientists agree that chances are likely that one or more of these planets support some life. However, many scientists wonder whether intelligent life exists on other planets. Some believe that twenty years of searching without any intelligible messages shows that no one is out there. They say that the evolution of intelligence comparable to ours is unlikely. Other scientists believe that our search hasn't been long enough to rule out the possibility that intelligent life exists in our galaxy. Although our sun family is only about five billion years old, our galaxy is about 20 billion years old. In that time, some scientists think it is likely that civilization much more advanced than ours have developed.

The satellite , which carried a payload of both C band and Ku band transponders , was launched on June 24 , 1993 and operated by PanAmSat Corporation . Control of Galaxy IV was lost on May 19 , 1998 when the satellite 's primary control processor failed . The backup control processor had suffered a previously undetected anomaly , and PanAmSat was not able to regain control of the spacecraft . Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20 , 1998 . Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth , a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder , causing an electrical short circuit . Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder , allowing whiskers to develop . The satellite manufacturer , Hughes , has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs , adding 45 to 90 kg per payload . The loss of this satellite was very disruptive to telecommunications in the United States . Pagers were affected greatly ; service was not restored for days . Wire news services , like Reuters , were also affected . The TV network CBS had to use alternate means of transmitting its programs , as did NPR . At the time of failure , Galaxy IV was in geostationary orbit at 99 ° W. This orbital slot was briefly occupied by Galaxy 4R , and is now occupied by the Galaxy VI satellite . Galaxy IV remains in space . - An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the Internet. Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. - Univision is an American Spanish language broadcast television network that is owned by Univision Communications. The network's programming is aimed at Latino Americans and includes telenovelas and other drama series, sports, sitcoms, reality and variety series, news programming, and imported Spanish-language feature films. - In telecommunication, a transponder is one of two types of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals. - The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold (Rene) Anselmo, was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry, news agencies, internet service providers, government agencies, and telecommunication companies. Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal, a communications lawyer in Washington, D.C., to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network (SIN), the current-day Univision. Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal's law firm, hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice, filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace. - A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. There are over 2,000 communications satellites in Earths orbit, used by both private and government organizations. - Greenwich is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 61,171. The largest town on Connecticut's Gold Coast, it is home to many hedge funds and other financial service companies. Greenwich is the southernmost and westernmost municipality in Connecticut as well as the six-state region of New England. It is 38+ minutes by train (express) from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan.

Patent searches can be incredibly complex and difficult to perform. If you do not feel comfortable taking on the task alone, or if you do not have the time or resources to do so, you can hire professionals to help you.","completion":"After hiring professional help for a patent search: 1. Consultation and Objective Setting: The first step involves discussing your invention or idea in detail with the professional or patent search firm you have chosen. This consultation will help them understand the technology and purpose of your invention, as well as its market potential. During this discussion, you should clearly outline your objectives for the patent search, such as identifying existing patents relevant to your invention or finding out if your idea is novel enough to warrant a patent application. 2. Defining the Scope: The professional will define the scope of the patent search based on your objectives and the information you provide about your invention. This will include determining the specific technical fields and classifications that the search needs to cover, as well as developing a set of keywords and search queries to use in the search process. 3. Conducting the Search: The professional will now begin the actual patent search, utilizing multiple databases and resources such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) database, and other specialized regional and industry-specific databases. The search process can be time-consuming and may take several days or even weeks, depending on the complexity of the search and the number of databases that need to be scanned. 4. Analyzing the Results: Once the search is complete, the professional will analyze the results, comparing the identified patents and patent applications to your invention. During this phase, the professional will look for similarities and differences, as well as any potential conflicts or overlaps between your invention and the existing patents. 5. Generating a Patent Search Report: Based on their analysis, the professional will compile a detailed patent search report, outlining the patents they have found and detailing their relevance to your invention. The report will typically highlight any potential conflicts, infringement risks, or challenges that you may face in obtaining a patent for your invention. The report may also provide recommendations for modifying or refining your invention to enhance its patentability. 6. Review and Discussion: After you have reviewed the patent search report, you should schedule a follow-up meeting with the professional to discuss the findings. This is an opportunity for you to ask questions, gain additional insights, and determine your next steps. The professional can advise you on whether your invention has a strong likelihood of receiving a patent, whether you should consider modifying your idea to overcome potential obstacles or if there are any other suggestions to strengthen your patent application. 7. Moving Forward: Based on the information and advice you have received from the professional and the results of the patent search, you can make an informed decision about how to proceed with your invention. This may involve filing a patent application, refining your idea, or even exploring alternative solutions or strategies if the search results indicate that your invention may not be patentable.

In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. - Michael Emile \\"Mikey\\" Craig (born 15 February 1960) is an English musician and DJ, best known as a bassist of the 1980s pop group Culture Club. - George Alan O'Dowd (born 14 June 1961), known professionally as Boy George, is an English singer, songwriter, DJ, fashion designer and photographer. He is the lead singer of the Grammy and Brit Award-winning pop band Culture Club. At the height of the band's fame, during the 1980s, they recorded global hit songs such as \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\" and \\"Karma Chameleon\\" and George is known for his soulful voice and androgynous appearance. He was part of the English New Romantic movement which emerged in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. - Jonathan \`\` Jon '' Aubrey Moss is an English drummer , best known as a member of the 1980s pop group Culture Club . He has also played with other bands , including London , The Nips , The Damned and Adam & The Ants . - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material. - Culture Club are an English band that was formed in 1981. The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. Culture Club sold more than 50 million records worldwide, including 13 million records in the United States. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Marching percussion instruments are specially designed to be played while moving. This is achieved by attaching the drum(s) to a special harness (also called a carrier or rack) worn by the drummer, although not all marching bands use such harnesses and instead use traditional baldrics to sling their drums (the British Armed Forces, for instance, still use the old style of slung drums). The drums are designed and tuned for maximum articulation and projection of sound, as marching activities are almost always outdoors or in large interior spaces. Articulation is paramount to producing a \\"clean\\" sound from all the drummers in the line. These instruments are used by marching bands, drum and bugle corps, indoor percussion ensembles, and pipe bands. A marching percussion ensemble is frequently known as a drumline or battery.

It is this bond that allows them to move with such unity, turning an ordinary car wash into an extraordinary performance art piece. As we continue to observe, we witness a gradual development of a narrative: a story of trust and kinship among workers who find joy and purpose in the simple pleasures of their shared labor. The line of men now extends beyond the car wash, creating an undulating wave of blue as their movements ripple through the group. New dancers join seamlessly, their individuality subsumed within the medley of bodies, each man becoming a brush stroke in the collective masterpiece.

Q: Article: Here's a movie-a sharp, sugar-rush of fun that's guaranteed to entertain the entire family. With some terrific computer-generated effects, a great cast and a fun-packed storyline, Robots is the best animated film since The Incredibles. Yep, it really is that good. Set in a world populated by robots, Ewan McGregor plays Rodney Copperbottom, a young robot who leaves his small-town home to pursue his dream of becoming an inventor. But after arriving in Robot City, his hopes of getting a job at Bigweld Industries are destroyed when he learns the firm has been taken over by the evil Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Egged on by his controlling mum, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), Ratchet plans to reduce half on Robot City's citizens to scrap metal by refusing to sell the spare Pans they need to survive. Instead, he wants to make a fortune selling expensive upgrades that few can afford. As he says, \\"Why be you when you can be new?\\" Aided by a few misfit robots known as the Rustles-including Robin Williams as the cowardly Fender (\\"I'm made of a metal called Afraidium\\")-Rodney must track down the firm's founder, Bigweld (Mel Brooks), and convince him to save the city from Ratchet's plans. The first thing that'll strike you about the movie is the thought that's gone into creating Robot City. It's a wondrous world full of mechanical marvels including wind-up cars and walking streetlamps. Also terrific are the special effects. This might be animated movie but at times you'll catch yourself thinking it's really a live-action film. Of course, there have been plenty of animated movies that looked the part but were let down by a weak storyline(see Shark Tale, for example). But Robots grips right from the start thanks to a heart-warming and thoroughly engaging plot that never bores. My only complaints are with Williams who, as usual, has a one-in-10 success rate with his jokes. Also a letdown is a romantic subplot between Rodney and a shapely robot called Cappy (Halle Berry) that doesn't go anywhere. Complains aside, this is a mechanical marvel that'll have you bolted firmly to your seat.

Make sure you explain the issue and why it's important for people to sign the petition. Encourage others to share and promote the petition as well. Step 7: Monitor progress and gather support Keep track of the number of people who have signed your petition and provide updates on any progress or setbacks. Provide additional information to your supporters if the situation changes or new information comes to light. Stay in touch with your target audience and, if necessary, attend meetings or public events to discuss the issue further. Step 8: Submit the petition Once you have gathered a significant amount of signatures, present the petition to the target audience. This can be done via email, postal mail, or in person at a meeting or public event. Make sure you follow any specific submission guidelines set by the target organization. Step 9: Follow up After submitting your petition, follow up with the target audience to see what action has been taken. Keep your supporters informed about the outcome and any further steps they can take to help achieve the goal. If necessary, adapt your strategy and continue advocating for your cause. In conclusion, starting a local petition involves researching the issue, defining the goal, determining the target audience, creating a persuasive statement, choosing a platform, launching and promoting the petition, monitoring progress, submitting the petition, and following up with the target audience and supporters. By following these steps and adapting your strategy as needed, you can increase your chances of making a tangible impact on your chosen issue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We want to find out the value of 'l' that makes the equation true. Here's the equation we start with: -31 * l + 1683 = 1993 First, we need to get rid of the 1683 on the left side of the equation to make it easier to find the value of 'l'. We do that by subtracting 1683 from both sides: (-31 * l + 1683) - 1683 = 1993 - 1683 Now our equation looks like this: -31 * l = 310 To find the value of 'l', we need to get rid of the -31 that's being multiplied by 'l'. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -31: (-31 * l) / (-31) = 310 / (-31) Now our equation looks like this: l = -10 So, the value of 'l' that makes the equation true is -10.

After the success of National Comics' new superhero characters Superman and Batman, Fawcett Publications started its own comics division in 1939, recruiting writer Bill Parker to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled Flash Comics. Besides penning stories featuring Ibis the Invincible, Spy Smasher, Golden Arrow, Lance O'Casey, Scoop Smith, and Dan Dare for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes, each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure. Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called \\"Captain Thunder\\". Staff artist Charles Clarence \\"C. C.\\" Beck was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat cartoony style that became his trademark. \\"When Bill Parker and I went to work on Fawcett's first comic book in late 1939, we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were,\\" Beck told an interviewer. \\"We decided to give our reader a real comic book, drawn in comic-strip style and telling an imaginative story, based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine, but going back to the old folk-tales and myths of classic times\\". The first issue of the comic book, printed as both Flash Comics #1 and Thrill Comics #1, had a low-print run in the fall of 1939 as an ashcan copy created for advertising and trademark purposes. Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark \\"Captain Thunder\\", \\"Flash Comics\\", or \\"Thrill Comics\\", because all three names were already in use. Consequently, the book was renamed Whiz Comics, and Fawcett artist Pete Costanza suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to \\"Captain Marvelous\\", which the editors shortened to \\"Captain Marvel\\". The word balloons in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as \\"Captain Marvel\\". Whiz Comics #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940) was published in late 1939. Answer this question \\"what was special abou tthe first issue?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"The first issue of the comic book, originally printed as both Flash Comics #1 and Thrill Comics #1, held a unique significance due to several factors. Firstly, it was created by Bill Parker and illustrated by C. C. Beck, with a distinctive approach to storytelling. Parker and Beck had noticed how poorly developed superhero comic books were at that time, prompting them to put forth a more creative and enthralling story inspired by folklore and classic mythologies. The pioneering issue featured a team of six superheroes, each one boasting a special power granted by a mythological figure. However, under the direction of Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh, these six characters were consolidated into one heroic persona initially named \\"Captain Thunder\\". Another intriguing aspect of this first issue was its low-print run in the fall of 1939, marking it as an ashcan copy, which means it was specifically designed for advertising and trademark purposes. Furthermore, this issue became notable for the challenges experienced in trademarking its original titles \\"Captain Thunder\\", \\"Flash Comics\\", and \\"Thrill Comics\\", as they were already in use. As a result, the book was rebranded as Whiz Comics. Additionally, the main superhero's name, initially proposed as \\"Captain Marvelous\\" by artist Pete Costanza, was eventually shortened to \\"Captain Marvel\\", making for another significant change in the course of developing this first issue. The changes were such that the word balloons in the story had to be re-lettered to reflect the new name of the main hero as \\"Captain Marvel\\". Finally, Whiz Comics #2, essentially the first public issue (as Whiz Comics #1 was unpublished), still carrying the cover date of February 1940, was published in late 1939 instead, which also adds to its particularity.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. But I can use this background: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. What is an answer for this question: Are the coral reefs near Malarn more or less healthy than the reefs near Trainlan? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question about the health of coral reefs near Malarn and Trainlan, we need to consider the information provided about the impact of dust on coral reefs and the locations of the two cities. Step 1: Determine the location of the two cities in relation to the dust sources - Malarn is a coastal town which regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. - Trainlan's location is not explicitly mentioned concerning any desert or dust sources. Step 2: Determine the threat level of dust on coral reefs in those areas - The background information provided mentions that the African dust adversely affects the coral reefs, primarily in the Caribbean and Florida. - It also highlights that similar dust plumes from the Gobi Desert impact corals in North America. - We don't have any information about the dust coming from the desert near Malarn affecting the coral reefs explicitly. Step 3: Evaluate the impact of dust on each city's coral reefs - Malarn seems to be more prone to dust pollution than Trainlan, due to its proximity to a dust source. - Although Malarn's coral reefs could be impacted by the dust, we don't have information about any direct link between the desert dust near Malarn and the coral reef decline in that specific location. Based solely on the available information, we cannot conclusively determine whether the coral reefs near Malarn are more or less healthy than the reefs near Trainlan. More information about the specific impacts of the desert dust on Malarn's coral reefs, as well as Trainlan's location and potential exposure to any dust or pollution sources, would be required to accurately answer this question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton endured a nightmare start to testing his new Mercedes after driving straight off the track at Jerez on his first day following a hydraulic problem Wednesday. The 2008 world champion, who left McLaren at the end of last season, was on his 15th lap of timed testing when his car went off the track and hit a barrier of tires. Hamilton's accident, which prevented him from returning to action, follows teammate Nico Rosberg's disastrous run which was ended by a minor fire Tuesday. Webber vows to battle Vettel for F1 title The German's car was found to have been suffering with electrical problems, while Mercedes took to Twitter to give an update on Hamilton's setback. \\"Lewis suffered a loss of rear brake pressure, the front brakes enabled him to slow the car but he couldn't avoid the barrier,\\" said","completion":"the tweet from the official Mercedes account. This unfortunate series of events for the Mercedes team marks a difficult beginning to the testing phase for their new car, the Mercedes W04, and raises concerns as they prepare for the upcoming 2013 Formula One season. With both Hamilton and Rosberg facing issues during their initial runs, it's clear that there is much work to be done to ensure the car's reliability and performance. The Mercedes W04 is a critical car for the team as it is seen as their best opportunity to challenge the front runners such as Red Bull, Ferrari, and Hamilton's former team McLaren. In the previous season, Mercedes had a challenging time, with only one win under their belt and finishing in 5th place in the constructors' championship. The arrival of Hamilton, a proven veteran and superstar of the sport, had initially boosted hopes for a more competitive season, but these initial setbacks bring that optimism into question. Hydraulic issues like the one described in Hamilton's accident are indicative of problems with the car's braking system. Hydraulic brakes, which are used in Formula One cars, rely on brake fluid to create pressure to stop the vehicle. When there is a loss of rear brake pressure, as in Hamilton's case, it can cause a serious decrease in braking power, greatly increasing the risk of accidents. Electrical problems, like the ones suffered by Rosberg, are also a significant issue for Formula One cars as they affect a multitude of systems within the vehicle. Electrical issues can lead to loss of power, difficulty in controlling the car, and even fires, as seen in Rosberg's test run. Addressing these problems swiftly and effectively will be paramount for the Mercedes team to ensure their cars are safe and competitive for the upcoming season. Moving forward, the Mercedes team will undoubtedly be analyzing the data collected from these test runs and working on measures to fix the issues that have arisen. They will also be focusing on improving other aspects of their car's performance, such as aerodynamics and engine power, to ensure they are in the best possible position at the start of the season. As for Hamilton and Rosberg, they will be integral to the development process, offering valuable feedback based on their experience behind the wheel and pushing the team to iron out any issues they face. Both drivers will be eager to move past these unfortunate incidents and focus on the task ahead. Despite the challenging start, it is essential not to dismiss Mercedes just yet. The team has plenty of experience, expertise, and resources behind them, and they have demonstrated in the past that they can overcome obstacles to find success. The next round of tests will be crucial for both the drivers and the team, as they work tirelessly to ensure their car is ready for the grueling season ahead. In conclusion, the nightmare start for Hamilton and Mercedes at Jerez is undoubtedly a significant setback, but it also serves as a stark reminder that there is still much work to be done before the cars hit the track for the first race of the season. With time and dedication, the team can address the issues that have arisen and use these early tests to better prepare themselves for a competitive 2013 Formula One season. The true value and potential of the Mercedes W04 remains to be seen, but the team will be determined to overcome these initial obstacles and improve as a unit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: An Oklahoma man who allegedly tried to hire a former co-worker to kill his pregnant girlfriend by poisoning her with ricin is set to stand trial. Preston Rhoads, 31, reportedly asked his friend to take part in a series of plots to poison the unnamed woman and her unborn fetus with the deadly toxin at their home in Oklahoma City. These included acting as a pizza delivery person and sprinkling ricin on a pizza, and dissolving the substance in a can of soda before handing it to the victim. Today, Rhoads waived his preliminary hearing in Oklahoma County District Court on two counts of solicitation to commit murder and attempting to kill another person.

Rhoads allegedly told his former co-worker in April that he had extracted ricin from the seeds of a castor bean plant after downloading a poison manual from the internet. He then referenced the hit U.S. crime drama Breaking Bad, before showing his friend a vial of the toxic substance, according to an affidavit cited by News 9. On the show, lead character Walter White prepares ricin twice as a form of killing - preferring it to other methods because it leaves behind little or no trace of its use on the victim.

Seeds: Rhoads allegedly told his former co-worker he had extracted ricin from the seeds of a castor bean plant (pictured) after downloading a poison manual from the internet. A single dose of the toxin can kill. Symptoms of ricin poisoning include trouble breathing, coughing, nausea, fever, seizures and vomiting. A single dose of the toxin, made up of only a few grains, can kill. After showing his friend the vial on April 6, Rhoads allegedly asked him to dress up as a pizza delivery person, before giving a pizza sprinkled with ricin to the victim. However, the suspect later decided against that particular plot because he did not wish for his girlfriend's parents to get sick, it is alleged. He then reportedly suggested that his unidentified would-be accomplice hide the toxin in a soft drink and give it to his girlfriend.

It added: 'Rhoads stated that if the girlfriend were to die in the process, Rhoads is okay with the result.'

A quarter of UK households would turn to credit or ask family and friends for help when faced with an unexpected bill, recent surveys suggest. Yet low interest rates are undermining any incentive to save. \\"We are asking young people to save in an environment where there are no Brownie points for saving,\\" said Janette Rutterford, professor of financial management at The Open University Business School. The BBC News website asked members of the UK Money Bloggers community for their tips about saving for a rainy day fund. Two surveys have revealed the extent to which families have lost the savings habit to cover the cost of unplanned events, such as fixing the car or paying for repairs in the home. The independent Money Advice Service, as part of its Financial Capability Survey, asked 3,500 people across the UK how they would pay for an unexpected bill of up to £300 within a week. Although 22% of them would dip into their savings (and 43% could pay with day-to-day cash), some 24% would use high-cost credit, ask for family help, or face problems. Breaking this down reveals: Prof Ashton, of Bangor University, described this group as \\"financially fragile\\". He said the use of overdrafts and other loans was a much more expensive way to pay bills, and ultimately meant debts could spiral and homes could be at risk. \\"This low level of precautionary savings is a big concern for policymakers,\\" he said. The lack of savings becomes more acute were the cost of the unexpected bill to rise to £500, a smaller YouGov survey for The Times newspaper suggested. Nearly half (46%) of manual workers and the unemployed would not be able to afford paying for an unexpected bill of this kind, it said. Nearly a third (31%) of typically middle-class professional, junior managerial and administrative workers would also be unable to pay. Young adults aged between 18 and 24 were the age group least likely to have funds available, the survey also suggested. Women were less likely to have cash available than men, and people in the Midlands, Scotland and Wales were the hardest-pressed in the UK. The typical UK household is hardly any better off now than it was before the financial crisis. Median average household disposable income in the UK was estimated to be £25,700 in 2014-15, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Before the economic downturn, the average was £25,400. Any money that is spare, and which could be saved, is - in many cases - failing to be diverted into emergency fund savings for a number of reasons, according to Prof Ashton and Prof Rutterford. Firstly, there is no longer a savings culture in the UK that mirrors a thrifty society such as China. \\"There is easy access to credit. Customers do not engage with their bank, nor talk to their bank manager. Decisions [on buying items] are made much more quickly, and people do not understand compound interest,\\" said Prof Rutterford. Secondly, confidence in the safety of savings took a hit during the financial crisis. Thirdly, and most importantly, interest rates have been pitiful for more than seven years. Even amid the low interest rate environment, Prof Ashton's research shows that loyal savers have received an even worse return on their savings than new customers. The Bank of England has signalled that the base rate, or Bank rate, may fall. Although this did not happen in July, as was widely expected, it may still do so in August. That can only make matters worse for those trying to put money aside who will see it gain little in value. \\"Savers really have been the sacrificial lambs of this downturn. While borrowers have benefited from historically low rates, savers have never known it so bad,\\" said Anna Bowes, founder of independent advice site SavingsChampion. Getting into a savings habit was important but, after that, the only possible tactic for savers trying to get more for their money was to move that money around by switching accounts, she said. \\"With almost a third of easy access accounts currently paying 0.25% or less, savers need to act now to improve their returns, because better rates are available. By leaving money languishing in these poor accounts they are playing directly into the providers' hands,\\" she said. \\"The actual act of putting money aside regularly is more important initially than the actual interest earned, but once the amount increases, a better interest rate can really make a difference.\\" Some of the better-paying accounts have various terms and conditions, such as a requirement for regular deposits and limited withdrawals. After a certain period of time, a switch would be needed, she said. All of this requires customers to be active. They would also need to make the act of putting money aside a monthly task in itself, rather than simply regarding their money-saving efforts as putting a lid on discretionary spending or searching for money-off deals.

The low interest rates make it harder for individuals to see any value in saving, as savings accounts yield little return. Factors such as easy access to credit, the financial crisis and dismal interest rates all contribute to the lack of a savings culture in the UK.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

Can you generate a short summary of the above paragraph?","completion":"The majority of rice mills in Myanmar's Yangon division, which were damaged by a cyclone last month, have returned to operation following rapid repairs, as reported by the local weekly publication, Flower News. Demonstrating resilience and promptness, these mills have managed to bounce back from the natural disaster, ensuring the continuation of rice production, a key aspect in Myanmar's agricultural sector. Effectively managing such crises is crucial, particularly in a country where agriculture plays a pivotal role in the economy and food security. Myanmar, which is ranked among the largest rice producing countries in the world, depends heavily on its rice mills. These mills not only contribute significantly to the domestic supply of rice but also to the export markets. Any disruption in their functionality could lead to a potential crisis in the food supply chain. The recovery of these mills in such a short span underlines the efficacy of disaster management in Myanmar. It demonstrates how the sector, despite facing a severe storm, was able to swiftly mobilize resources for repair and recovery, thus minimizing operational downtime and stabilizing the supply of rice both locally and internationally. The Yangon division, which houses many of these mills, is prominent in Myanmar's rice industry. The storm's aftermath, therefore, had posed a significant threat to the region's productivity and its overall contribution to the country's rice output. Nevertheless, the quick restoration of operations has helped mitigate these potential drawbacks. Resuming operation after such an incident also provides a sense of security to the farmers and workers who depend on these mills for their livelihood. It sends a positive message, indicating that the system is robust and prepared to deal with unexpected events such as cyclones. As these mills come back online, they are also fueling the progression of the surrounding local economies, which highly depend on agriculture. In conclusion, the restoration of the cyclone-destroyed rice mills in Myanmar's Yangon division is an exemplary lesson in disaster recovery and management. It symbolizes the country's commitment to maintaining a steady food supply chain and providing economic stability. By quickly restoring these essential agricultural operations, Myanmar has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in the face of environmental challenges."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Analyze the situation I assume that the person is an athlete, wearing appropriate athletic clothing and shoes and standing in a stadium or a training area designated for pole vaulting events. Step 2: Understand the pole vaulting fundamentals Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which an athlete uses a long and flexible pole to leap over a high bar. The objective is to clear the bar without knocking it off its rests. Step 3: Observe the athlete's warm-up routine The person starts warming up before the attempt, stretching their muscles, practicing running with the pole, and visualizing the whole process to prepare mentally for the jump. Step 4: Analyze the starting position The person assumes their starting position by holding the pole with both hands, one higher than the other, with the bottom end of the pole trailing behind them. Step 5: Track the running approach The athlete begins to sprint down the track, maintaining a firm grip on the pole and proper body posture while steadily accelerating towards the takeoff point. Step 6: Observe the plant and take off As the athlete approaches the takeoff spot, they plant the pole into a pre-established hole in the ground called the \\"box.\\" Simultaneously, they use their momentum and the pole's flexibility to propel their body upwards and begin the actual vault. Step 7: Evaluate the swing-up and inversion phase The athlete swings their legs up and inverts their body, becoming nearly vertical with their head facing downwards and feet reaching towards the sky. They maintain a tight grip on the pole as it bends from the force generated during the takeoff. Step 8: Observe the clearance and push-off stage Once the person has reached the peak height in their inverted position, they attempt to clear the bar by thrusting their hips upwards and extending their legs to push away from the pole. The athlete then maneuver their body over the bar, ensuring not to displace it. Step 9: Assess the landing After clearing the bar, the athlete releases their grip on the pole and falls safely onto the mat below, preferably landing on their back to minimize the risk of injury. Step 10: Analyze the performance and prepare for the next attempt The person gets up, retrieves their pole, and rejoins their coach or teammates to review their performance. They may make adjustments to their technique or focus on specific areas for improvement before attempting the next vault."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In this case, their motivation could be to fulfill their duties and maintain their professional reputation. 2. Personal Relationship: If PersonX and PersonY share a close personal connection, such as family members, friends, or partners, PersonX may be motivated by their desire to support and help PersonY through their actions. This could involve standing up for them in a disagreement, advocating for their needs and wishes, or helping them navigate a challenging situation. 3. Shared Goals or Beliefs: PersonX may be aligned with the same ideals and objectives as PersonY and therefore supports the interests of PersonY to further those shared goals.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Which region had more endangered species? Hint: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, we can infer that the Northern region of Italy, where animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, would have more endangered species. This is because, as the hint explains, biodiversity tends to be low in an environment with high abiotic stress. Accordingly, the high level of abiotic stress in the Northern region would cause a decrease in the number of species, thus making them more susceptible to becoming population threatened, endangered, or extinct. Hence, the Northern region of Italy would likely have more endangered species than the Southern region where abiotic stress is not as present. The chain of reasoning is as follows: Step 1: Establish understanding that abiotic stress negatively impacts biodiversity. Step 2: Identify that Northern Italy experiences more abiotic stress than Southern Italy. Step 3: Relate high abiotic stress to increased possibility of species becoming endangered. Step 4: Infer that Northern Italy, with higher abiotic stress, has more endangered species."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

European judges have ruled that terror suspect and Broadmoor patient Haroon Aswat cannot be deported because it would be bad for his mental health. Aswat, who claims to be a schizophrenic, is wanted by the U.S. authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in Bly, Oregon.

However, civil rights advocates maintain that Aswat's mental health condition requires special consideration and that extraditing him to the United States would create a dangerous precedent for future human rights cases.

Is Victoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1840. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Victoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1840\\" is a good but brief answer to the question. If you are looking for a more detailed response, here it is: Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married on February 10, 1840, at the Chapel Royal in St. James's Palace, London. Queen Victoria was the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, while Prince Albert was a German prince from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. As mentioned in the brief answer, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were first cousins. They shared a common grandfather, Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Queen Victoria's mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Prince Albert's father, Duke Ernst I of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, were siblings, making their marriage an instance of royal intermarriage, which was common during that period. Before their marriage, Victoria and Albert had met several times and reportedly developed a mutual attraction during their meetings. Their correspondence leading up to the marriage also shows their affection and respect for each other. Queen Victoria proposed to Prince Albert on October 15, 1839, after one such meeting, keen on making him her husband and consort. The marriage was a great example of love and partnership. Victoria and Albert went on to have nine children, who eventually married into various European royal families, strengthening diplomatic ties and forging alliances. They also worked closely together in matters of state and governance, with Prince Albert assuming an active role in assisting Queen Victoria in her duties as a queen. This partnership was beneficial to both the British monarchy and the nation as a whole, contributing to many progressive reforms and innovations during the Victorian era. Prince Albert's untimely death in 1861 at the age of 42 devastated Queen Victoria. She went into deep mourning, wearing black for the rest of her life and retreating from public life for many years. Her deep devotion to her beloved husband was evident in her numerous memorials dedicated to him and her insistence on preserving his memory. In conclusion, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's marriage was a significant event in British history that strengthened the British monarchy and facilitated progress within the nation during the Victorian era. Their strong partnership and mutual love have been remembered and celebrated through the years, making their marriage an exemplary model of a royal union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hannibal escapes and sets out to rescue Templeton \\"Faceman\\" Peck (Bradley Cooper), who is held captive at Tuco's ranch. Hannibal saves Face after enlisting fellow Ranger B.A. Baracus (Quinton Jackson), driving to the rescue in BA's modified GMC Vandura van.[9] Pursued by Tuco, they stop at a nearby Army Hospital to recruit the services of eccentric pilot Howling Mad Murdock (Sharlto Copley). They flee in a medical helicopter, chased by Tuco, in a dogfight that leaves BA with a fear of flying. The battle ends when they lure Tuco's helicopter into American airspace, where it is shot down by a USAF F-22 Raptor for trespassing. Eight years later in Iraq, Hannibal is contacted by CIA Special Activities Division operative Lynch (Patrick Wilson), who assigns them a black ops mission to recover U.S. Treasury plates and over 1 billion in cash from Iraqi insurgents slated to move it out of Baghdad in an armored convoy. Hannibal's commanding officer, General Morrison (Gerald McRaney), consents to the operation but Face's former girlfriend, Defense Criminal Investigative Service Capt. Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), tries to discourage the team against getting the plates. The mission is successful; when the team returns to base, however, the money and Morrison's vehicle are destroyed by Brock Pike (Brian Bloom) and his men from the private security firm Black Forest. Without Morrison (the only proof that they were authorized to act), Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and BA are court martialed and they are sentenced to ten years in separate prisons and dishonorably discharged. Sosa also ended up court-martialed and is demoted to lieutenant. Six months later, Lynch visits Hannibal in prison and tells him that Pike may be trying to sell the plates with the help of an Arab backer. Hannibal, who has been tracking Pike on his own, makes a deal with Lynch: full reinstatement and clean...

Spectators begin to huddle and quietly discuss the accident they just witnessed, with some wondering if it could've been avoided. Amidst the concerned murmurs, the event organizers hastily decide to pause the race while they assess and address the safety concerns of the dirt bike course. While medical professionals attend to the injured person in a nearby medical tent, the staff and volunteers at the event start to inspect the course for any dangerous obstacles or potential hazards that might have contributed to the accident. They examine every jump, corner, and straightaway with an eagle-eyed attention to detail, looking for anything that could pose a threat to the riders and take the necessary steps to mitigate the risks associated with the course. The riders who had been participating in the race gather around their coaches and support teams, discussing the accident and brainstorming ways to avoid similar incidents in the future. Many share their concerns about the course conditions and collaborate on strategies to safely navigate the challenging terrain; they are well aware that their sport carries inherent risks, but they are also intent on minimizing those risks wherever possible. As the course inspection continues, the organizers realize that the accident has raised legitimate concerns among the riders, spectators, and the wider off-road motorcycle community. They decide to hold a brief community meeting to gather feedback, address the concerns, and discuss possible improvements for the course layout. Members of the audience suggest more clearly marked hazard signs, additional course marshals to assist riders, and even implementing some changes to the course layout to improve the overall safety and flow of the track. Taking all the suggestions into consideration, the organizers and the course builders work together to make the necessary adjustments, conducting in-depth consultations with riders, trainers, and safety experts in the process.

Article:As the conference in the Saudi capital began, one of the most powerful rebel groups struck an uncompromising tone. Ahrar al-Sham insisted President Bashar al-Assad would have to face justice. It also criticised the presence of Syria-based opposition figures tolerated by Mr Assad and the absence of al-Qaeda's affiliate in the country. World powers want peace talks between a unified opposition delegation and the government to start by 1 January, and a transitional government to be formed within six months. The two-day conference at a heavily secured hotel in Riyadh is taking place under the auspices of the Saudi government, which has provided political and military support to the Syrian opposition. One delegate told the AFP news agency the first day would focus on political questions, including the outline of a potential political settlement, while the second would be dedicated to discussing \\"terrorism, a ceasefire and reconstruction\\". Among those attending are representatives of the Western-backed National Coalition, whose leaders are based mainly outside Syria, and the more moderate National Co-ordination Committee, which is tolerated by Damascus. Most of the main rebel factions are taking part, including Ahrar al-Sham, an ultraconservative Islamist group that operates mainly in north-western Syria. Notably absent are Kurdish groups, which control large parts of the north, and the powerful al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, which is part of an alliance with Ahrar al-Sham but is regarded internationally as a terrorist organisation. The BBC's Hanan Razek in Riyadh says there is a keen sense of optimism that a common position will be found. The president of the National Coalition, Khaled Khoja, said many of those attending the meeting were already in broad agreement. The main Western-backed political alliance, the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, supports the implementation of the 2012 Geneva Communique, which calls for the establishment of a transitional governing body in Syria. Its Turkey-based leadership insists that President Assad must go The Syria-based opposition grouping, the National Co-ordination Committee for Democratic Change, calls for negotiations on a peaceful transition. It is tolerated by the government, though its members have been harassed and detained. Ahrar al-Sham is a ultraconservative Islamist, or Salafist, rebel group that aims to topple Mr Assad and build an Islamic state, though it vows to achieve the latter through the ballot box and not force. It is part of Jaysh al-Fatah, an alliance that includes the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front. Jaysh al-Islam, a Islamist rebel group active mostly around Damascus, previously called for the establishment of an Islamic state. Its leader now says he favours allowing Syrians to decide what sort of state they want. The Western-backed Southern Front alliance, which operates in the south, describes its self as \\"the moderate voice and the strong arm of the Syrian people\\". But Ahrar al-Sham - whose founders had links to al-Qaeda - criticised the \\"lack of representation of jihadist factions\\" at a level reflecting their presence on the ground in Syria. Some of those invited were \\"closer to representing the regime than the people and the revolution\\", it added without elaborating. The group also warned that it would \\"not accept the results of this conference\\" unless they included \\"the complete cleansing of the Russian-Iranian occupation of Syrian land, and the sectarian militias which support it\\". It called for the \\"overthrow of the Assad regime with all its pillars and symbols, and handing them over for fair trial\\". Security and military institutions would also have to be dissolved, Ahrar al-Sham said, rejecting last month's statement by 17 world powers - including the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran - that called for them to be kept intact initially.

Democratic lawmakers are beginning to distance themselves from president Barack Obama's decision to trade five known associates of the Taliban with the terrorist network in exchange for the release of accused deserter Bowe Bergdahl. One Democratic lawmaker called Obama’s Taliban trade 'a dangerous precedent' as others are now reluctant to praise the president's choice. Even after White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough talked with Senators from the president's party at their weekly policy luncheon on Tuesday, Democrats wouldn't verbally support Obama's judgment call. The White House officially went into damage-control mode on Wednesday, announcing that Pentagon and intelligence officials would brief the Senate on the deal late Wednesday behind closed doors. The House of Representatives is in recess and will not return until next week. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS. Panic: Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., is surrounded by reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday. Levin is defending President Barack Obama's decision to swap five members of the Taliban for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl but many in his party are becoming increasingly disquiet. 'Deserter': Senior Dem Dutch Ruppersberger today said Bergdahl's release (exchange caught on video above) in the swap with five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo put Americans at risk all around the world. Damning: Rep. Ruppersberger added: 'Since World War Two we have not negotiated with terrorists or other groups' Dutch Ruppersberger, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued the strongest rebuke of Obama from a Democrat so far when he said on Tuesday that the trade set a 'dangerous precedent that puts all Americans at risk throughout the world.' 'Since World War Two we have not negotiated with terrorists or other groups,' Ruppersberger told the Baltimore Sun. 'What concerns me is the future. This puts all Americans at risk throughout the world, including our men and women on the front line…for kidnapping.' A dozen Democratic Senators refused to put their approval on record when approached by The Weekly Standard on Tuesday, and several used a classified briefing they were to receive today on the matter as an excuse to delay a verdict. 'I just don't know enough about it. I really don't,' Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told the Weekly Standard yesterday afternoon. 'All I've heard is what I've read in the press,' Vermont Sen. Pat Leahy said. 'I don't have enough information at this point in time,' Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said. 'I do think getting our boys back home, that's a good quality. I do have some issues about whether [Bergdahl] deserted or not.' 'It depends on all the facts and circumstances of the case,' Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin said. 'I'm not going to give you a conclusion in the case because I don't know all the circumstances.' 'I'm not going to comment until I look at the brief,' Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said, backtracking from her claim on Sunday that Obama 'acted within his constitutional authority, which he should have done,' to do the deed. 'It's very disturbing,' said West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. 'Everything you hear.' 'I'm going to reserve judgment until after we have a secured briefing tomorrow,' Manchin, a vulnerable Democrat up for re-election this year, said. The president and his administration hoped to be basking in the glow of Bergdahl's release right up to November's federal elections. But rumors began to fly quickly that Bergdahl had purposefully wandered off base on the evening in question with no intention of returning. Fading support: A host of Democrats contacted today would not go on public record in support of Obama (pictured today in Brussels, Belgium with German Chancellor Angela Merkel) Coupled. with news that search and rescue efforts for Bergdahl resulted in the. deaths of at least six soldiers, and the president's admission on Monday. that it's 'absolutely' possible that the newly released Taliban. fighters could return to the battlefield, the Bergdahl bounce began wear. off. The. Obama administration also fumbled the play by not telling Congress. about the negotiations until the deal had already been sealed. The judgment lapse had lawmakers – whom the president is required to notify 30 days before releasing detainees from the Guantanmo Bay detention camp in Cuba – on both sides of the aisle fuming this week. The president tried to temper criticism on Monday by claiming that lawmakers had known for 'quite some time' about the government's negotiations with the Taliban, but his remarks were met with immediate resistance. Later that evening, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken called Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chair Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, and committee vice-chairman, Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, to apologize for the 'oversight.' Feinstein told reports on Tuesday that the last official communication she had with administration officials about the proposition of trading prisoners from Guantanmo Bay for Bergdahl was two and a half years ago. Feinstein said she and Chambliss sent then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a letter in December of 2011 and president Obama a letter in January 2012 with questions about the trade and both letters were met with detailed responses. But that was the last time she'd heard about the swap until Saturday, when she received a call informing her that Bergdahl and the five Taliban fighters had been released. 'Given the past briefings and concerns we had addressed, and these were from both [congressional intelligence] committees and the leadership of both committees, the concerns were bipartisan, and I strongly believe that we should have been consulted,' Feinstein told reporters on Tuesday. 'I think you can see that we're very dismayed about it,' she added. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who is a former Senate Intelligence chairman and still serves on the committee, said he shares in Feinstein's disappointment. 'I don't like it when the White House says the Intelligence committees were briefed. Because we weren't,' he told Politco on Tuesday. Rockefeller. said he would have been fine with the administration telling only. senior members of the committee, 'but when they say, \\"Oh yes, they were. briefed,\\" what they are referring to is 2011-2012 when I was still in. grade school.' Senate. Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin defended president Obama on Tuesday. for making the call without Congress's explicit approval. Yet, even he. said ,'I intend to ask what risks we would have incurred if the. secretary of defense had decided to wait 30 days after completing. negotiations and providing the required notice to Congress rather than. acting immediately.' Rush to judgment: Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel today said it was 'unfair to presume anything' about the claims of Bergdahl's desertion at a press conference today in Brussels. 'One of the issues I want to bring up: What is the precedent this sets or doesn't set?' Sen. Mark Begich told Politico on Wednesday. House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are the only two lawmakers visibly standing by the president. 'I support the president, and that means I support their understanding of what threat those people who were released with would be to our country,' Pelosi said on Tuesday at an event in Boston, Massachusetts. 'I'm saying I believe that the president has the assurances that he needs that those people will not be a threat to the American people,' Pelosi continued. Reid said on the Senate floor today that, 'President Obama, as Commander-in-Chief, acted honorably in helping an American soldier return home to his family,' 'Unfortunately, opponents of President Obama have seized upon the release of an American prisoner of war, using what should be a moment of unity and celebration for our nation, as a chance to play political games,' he continued. Reid argued that even if Sgt. Bergdahl deserted, it's up to the military to punish him. 'What was the alternative? Would any American honestly prefer that a U.S. soldier remain in captivity until all of the questions have been answered?' Reid asked. 'Of course not. In the United States of America, we rescue our soldiers first and ask questions later.' Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel today said it was 'unfair to presume anything' about the claims of Bergdahl's desertion at a press conference today in Brussels. He repeated that the US had a responsibility to get its soldiers back. 'Let's get the facts, but forst let's focus on getting Sgt Bergdahl well.'

It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview. - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind.

Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: The act of disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines is a? Context: Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4] Answer:","completion":"The act of disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines is considered a form of apostasy."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Summarize this article: James Tavernier supplied the first of a series of lethal finishes against part-timers the Ibrox side only managed to beat once in five outings last season. Michael Chopra equalised, but a Martyn Waghorn penalty soon restored the lead. Jason Holt and Kenny Miller killed the game before half-time and the latter added his own second late on. The thumping victory took Rangers to the top of the Scottish Championship table. A mere two games have been played and they are only ahead of Queen of the South and Dumbarton on goal difference. But the signs are there that this Ibrox side could dominate the division in a similar fashion to the Hearts one that left their Glasgow rivals trailing in their wake last term. Under Ally McCoist, Kenny McDowall and Stuart McCall, Rangers had struggled to overcome Alloa and much was made of their dislike of the artificial surface at Recreation Park. Successor Warburton promised no excuses this time and there was no need for them as his restructured team quickly found their feet in the Clackmannanshire sunshine. Tavernier has been a revelation since his summer purchase from Wigan Athletic and the right-back provided another thundering finish into the top corner after being played in behind the defence by Nicky Law - the Englishman's third goal in four games. The lead only lasted three minutes as Chopra was found by a Graeme Holmes chip over the visiting defence to apply the kind of lethal volleyed finish that reminded onlookers of the 31-year-old striker's days with Newcastle United, Cardiff City, Sunderland and Ipswich Town. Thoughts turned to December, when Alloa came from two goals down to defeat Rangers in the Petrofac Training Cup semi-final. However, there was to be no sting in the tail for the Wasps this time as Holmes spoiled his earlier work by barging Holt to hand Waghorn the opportunity to restore the lead from the penalty spot within another two minutes. Lee Wallace had a quiet game in his first as Rangers' official new captain, but it was the left-back's low drive, spilled by goalkeeper Andy McNeil, that allowed Holt further involvement with a goal of his own from close range. When Tavernier found Miller to finish from similar range shortly before the break, the game was effectively over. The interval was time for Alloa boss Danny Lennon to switch to a less vulnerable formation, but the damage was done. Rangers were by now in second gear and could afford some showboating from the midweek arrival from Tottenham Hotspur, Nathan Oduwa. They also had two goals disallowed and still managed a further goal-line finish from Miller in the closing minutes. Warburton's side march on to bigger challenges while Lennon, whose side lie bottom without a point, was left to wonder how long it will take his 14 new signings to gel. Alloa manager Danny Lennon: \\"You could certainly see the gulf between the clubs today, but what the biggest message for the players today was that they've got to have more belief, they've earned the right to compete in this league but what we have to do is compete better than what we showed today.\\" Match ends, Alloa Athletic 1, Rangers 5.

Options: [1]. yes; [2]. no;","completion":"[2]. no; The statement provided is not the correct answer to the question about the rank to which Eisenhower was promoted on July 7, 1942. However, I can provide a detailed response to the question. On July 7, 1942, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would later become the 34th President of the United States, was promoted to the rank of Major General (two stars) in the United States Army. This promotion occurred during World War II when Eisenhower was serving in various leadership capacities. Before this promotion, Eisenhower had been rapidly climbing the military ranks due to his demonstrated skills in organization, planning, and leadership. In February 1942, he was appointed as the Chief of the War Plans Division in Washington, D.C., and was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General (one star). In this position, Eisenhower was responsible for restructuring and developing strategies for the United States' overall war effort. It was during this time that he impressed the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, with his abilities. In June 1942, Eisenhower was appointed as the Commanding General of the European Theater of Operations (ETOUSA) and was based in London. This corresponds to the information provided in the initial statement. However, it doesn't address his promotion to Major General on July 7, 1942. As the Commanding General of ETOUSA, Eisenhower was responsible for overseeing the planning and coordination of the Allied forces' campaigns in Western Europe, including Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of North Africa) and Operation Overlord (the Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day). His leadership and organizational skills played a crucial role in the success of these campaigns and contributed to the eventual defeat of the Axis Powers. In conclusion, the correct answer is 'no,' as the statement provided does not address Eisenhower's promotion on July 7, 1942. The correct information is that he was promoted to the rank of Major General on that day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What will happen if each and every person living on earth turns vegetarian? What if every person on earth turns vegetarian? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Select from the following. (a). no; (b). yes;","completion":"(b). yes; Both questions are asking about the potential consequences or outcomes of a scenario where everyone on Earth adopts a vegetarian lifestyle. If every person on Earth turns vegetarian, there would be several significant impacts on various aspects of society, the economy, health, and the environment. Some of these potential effects include: 1. Health: A widespread switch to vegetarianism could lead to a generally healthier world population. Vegetarian diets are often rich in antioxidants, fiber, vitamins, and minerals while being lower in saturated fats. This could result in a decrease in chronic illnesses such as heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. However, people would also need to be mindful of potential nutrient deficiencies related to the lack of animal proteins, such as vitamin B12 and certain essential amino acids. 2. Environment: A global shift to vegetarianism would have a profound impact on the environment. Livestock farming contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. By reducing the demand for animal products, greenhouse gas emissions related to agriculture would be substantially decreased. Additionally, land, water, and energy resources that are currently allocated to livestock production could be diverted towards growing plant-based food, reforestation, or ecosystem restoration projects. 3. Economy: The economic landscape would undergo a paradigm shift due to the change in demand and consumption patterns. As people transition to a vegetarian diet, demand for plant-based food sources would increase, pushing up prices in the short term. Simultaneously, the demand for meat and other animal products would plummet, leading to potential job losses within the livestock farming sector. However, these short-term disruptions could give way to new opportunities, such as growth in the plant-based food industry, innovations in alternative protein sources, and investments in regenerative agriculture. 4. Animal Welfare: The widespread adoption of vegetarianism would lead to a substantial decline in the demand for meat and dairy products, resulting in fewer animals being raised and slaughtered for human consumption. This would dramatically improve animal welfare and potentially reduce the scale of factory farming operations, enabling better living conditions and ethical treatment for the remaining animals in agriculture. 5. Hunger and Food Security: In a vegetarian world, food production could potentially become more efficient. Currently, a significant portion of plant-based calories and proteins are fed to livestock, ultimately providing only a small fraction of those nutrients when consumed as meat. By growing plant-based foods directly for human consumption, more food would be available to address hunger and malnutrition in regions where it is most needed. It is essential to note that while turning to vegetarianism would have several benefits, the practical implementation and management of this global dietary conversion pose challenges in terms of adequate access, balanced nutrition, and adaptation to cultural and culinary practices. However, even a modest reduction in meat consumption, alongside improvements in sustainable farming and food distribution practices, could contribute significantly to addressing many global problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What might have happened?\\" OPTIONS: (i) they encountered a cnidaria. (ii) they must have startled a shark. (iii) they came in contact with a whale. (iv) they encountered the wrath of Poseidon.","completion":"A person takes a dive under the sea and feels faint, with a dart stuck to them. What might have happened? Based on the given fact that \\"poisonous darts are used for defense by sea anemones,\\" the most likely answer to this question is (i) they encountered a cnidaria. Sea anemones are a group of marine predatory animals classified under the phylum Cnidaria. They come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, and use specialized cells called cnidocytes to fire venomous darts or nematocysts at potential threats or prey. These darts contain toxins that can immobilize or even kill small marine creatures. While the toxins' effects on humans differ depending on the species, some sea anemones are known to cause pain, skin irritation, and in rare cases, more severe symptoms. In this scenario, the person diving underwater might have accidentally touched or come in close contact with a sea anemone, causing it to feel threatened and release its venomous darts as a defense mechanism. The dart sticking to the person's skin could have introduced the toxins into their body, leading to a feeling of faintness and potential further symptoms. Considering the other options provided, the following explanations could be offered: (ii) They must have startled a shark: While sharks can be dangerous to humans in some cases, they do not use darts for defense or attack. A shark would likely have bitten the diver, which would be a more significant and noticeable injury than a dart puncture. (iii) They came in contact with a whale: Whales are generally very gentle and do not pose a threat to humans. A whale might accidentally knock a diver with its tail or body but would not cause a dart puncture. Additionally, whales do not have any venomous darts as a part of their anatomy. (iv) They encountered the wrath of Poseidon: Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, is a mythological figure and not a scientifically plausible explanation for the dart puncture. It is essential to focus on realistic and evidence-based reasoning in explaining such phenomena. In conclusion, option (i), \\"they encountered a cnidaria,\\" is the most plausible answer to the question, given that we know sea anemones employ poisonous darts as a form of protection. This would explain the person's feeling of faintness and the dart that they found stuck to their skin."},{"prompt":"The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful.

After her arrest in Peshawar, near the border, on 23 October she pleaded guilty to all charges and was fined 110,000 rupees (1,100). She could have faced years in prison.

It led to one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed. He tracked her down 17 years later, living in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan. Gula later moved back to Pakistan and he kept in touch. Mr McCurry recently said he had hired a lawyer for her following her arrest.

Write a question about the following article: The Cambodian-Spanish War was an attempt by the Spanish Empire to conquer Cambodia, establish their own king, and Christianize the population. Along with the Spanish, the Japanese, Filipinos, Thai, Portuguese, and Dominicans participated in the invasion of Cambodia. Each country possessed different motives for their invasion of Cambodia. Specifically, the Thai interference and the Spanish expedition was a result of a power struggle between rival factions in Cambodia's government. In addition, both Spanish and Portuguese took part in the invasion of Cambodia because King Philip II ruled both Spain and Portugal. In February 1593, Thai ruler Naresuen attacked Cambodia in order to fight the Burmese. Later on, in May 1593, 100,000 Thai soldiers invaded Cambodia. As a result of the Thai's invasion, Lovek was conquered in July 1594. In 1593, the Spanish expedition led by Gregorio Vargas Machuca and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzales entered Cambodia through the city of Manila.Although the Spanish invasion of Cambodia failed, Ruiz and Veloso succeeded in establishing king Barom Reachea II in May 1597. Private individuals of Muslim Malays, Chams, Cambodians retaliated to Spain and Portugal's invasion by slaughtering the Spanish and Portuguese, including Diogo Veloso. Only a few Filipinos and one Spaniard survived the massacre. Because of the massacre, Spain's planned Christianization of Cambodia failed.

Icahn Unveils 9.3% Stake In Nuance, Voice-Recognition Firm Reportedly Behind Apple's Siri Nuance is thought to be ehind the technology Apple uses to power Siri - Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife Carl Icahn just won’t sit tight. In a filing released after market hours on Monday, the billionaire investor revealed a 9.3% passive stake in Nuance Communications, a voice-recognition company reportedly behind Apple’s Siri. Shares in the company surged in after-hours trading. Icahn has amassed a 29.3 million-share position in the company, worth more than 591 million at Monday’s closing price of 20.18. The stock closed the day flat. News of Icahn’s position came a couple of weeks after private equity shop Warburg Pincus disclosed a 14.6% stake. Nuance, which had a market capitalization of 6.4 billion by the end of the trading day on Monday, develops voice-recognition technology. Reportedly, Apple’s Siri is powered by Nuance’s software. Voice-recognition technology, which has been around for quite some time, could potentially revolutionize human interaction with gadgets and digital devices, as improved hardware and software pave the way for smoother conversations with machines. Under Marissa Mayer’s leadership, Yahoo recently acquired news app Summly for 30 million, which, according to 17-year-old founder and CEO, “uses a genetic algorithm to mimic how a human actually thinks.” With Google reportedly working on “intelligent computers [that] understand human language,” some like Upstart’s Michael del Castillo suggest the move to bridge the communication gap between people and their devices is here to stay. Icahn’s investment is the latest in a series of moves by the billionaire, who Forbes just dubbed the richest man on Wall Street. At 77, Icahn is at the top of his game, as my colleagues Nathan Vardi and Steve Bertoni explained in their latest cover story on the famed activist, Icahn Unleashed. Investors were following Icahn’s lead in post-market trading in New York. By 5:49 PM, the stock was up 9% to 22.00.

Article:","completion":"Title: Helping Cows Stay Healthy by Removing Sick Ones Hello kids! Today, we are going to talk about something important happening in Somerset and Gloucestershire. These are two places in England where farmers have lots of cows, and we get our milk and other yummy things from them. But there's a problem: some of these cows have become sick with a disease called Tuberculosis (TB). This disease can spread very easily from one cow to another and it's not good for the cows or the farmers. So, the government decided to do something to stop the disease from spreading. They came up with an idea called a \\"cull\\". This means removing the sick cows from the healthy ones, so that they can protect the healthy cows and help them stay strong. But do you remember the big, fun event called the Olympics that happened a while ago? During that time, everybody was very busy, and there was another issue with some people not agreeing with the plan. This made it difficult for the government to start the cull and there was limited time left before winter came. You see, in winter, it's harder to separate sick cows from healthy ones because they all stay close together to keep warm. So, it was important for the government to act quickly. That's why a very important person named Owen Paterson, who works for the government and takes care of our environment, decided to do something. Instead of going to another important place called Paris, he went to a big building called the Commons to talk to other important people about the cull.

This article: The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display. contains an answer for the question: Who is often described as looking at herself on the mirror in the work?, what is it ?

There had been a great storm, the vessel was among the breakers, he had got into the long-boat with Arthur to put in the plugs, they had been lifted up and blown away--and then suddenly Jack sat upright. It was light enough for him to see that he was still in the boat, but its back was broken and its sides staved in.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power. Which country used more coal? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Turkey used more coal in its energy production, since it relied mostly on fossil fuels for generating electricity. Fossil fuels include coal, natural gas, and petroleum, and are the leading energy sources in many countries due to their high energy density and relatively low cost. Greece, on the other hand, primarily used nuclear power to generate electricity. Nuclear power is a type of low-carbon energy produced by splitting uranium atoms in a process called nuclear fission. This process releases a huge amount of heat, which is then used to generate steam that powers turbines to produce electricity. Nuclear power plants do not directly emit greenhouse gases, and they contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in countries that depend on them for energy. Although Turkey's primary source of energy for electricity generation is fossil fuels, it does not necessarily mean that the country uses only coal. Turkey also has significant natural gas reserves and has made efforts to diversify its energy sources by investing in renewable energy such as solar and wind power. However, coal remains an important energy source in Turkey, and its consumption has been increasing in recent years due to the country's rapid growth and increasing energy demand. In Greece, the majority of electricity is generated from nuclear power plants, which do not use coal as a fuel source. Greece has also invested in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Though Greece does have some fossil fuel-powered plants, its reliance on coal is significantly less than that of Turkey. In conclusion, Turkey has a higher coal consumption for electricity generation than Greece, due to its reliance on fossil fuels as the primary energy source, while Greece predominantly uses nuclear power for electricity generation. This reliance on fossil fuels increases Turkey's greenhouse gas emissions and poses environmental challenges, while Greece's investment in nuclear power and renewable energy sources contributes to a lower carbon footprint."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness is assigned to stop Capone, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen tipping Capone off. He has a chance meeting with Irish-American veteran officer Jimmy Malone, who is fed up with the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting that they find a man from the police academy who has not come under Capone's influence. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (aka-Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and intelligence. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., they conduct a successful raid on a Capone liquor cache and start to gain positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \\"The Untouchables.\\" Capone later kills the henchman in charge of the cache as a warning to his other men. Wallace discovers that Capone has not filed an income tax return for some years and suggests that the team try to build a tax evasion case against him, since he is well-insulated from his other crimes. An alderman offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness angrily refuses it and throws him out of the office. When Capone gunman Frank Nitti threatens Ness' family, Ness has his wife and daughter moved to a safe house. His team flies to the CanadaâUnited States border to intercept an incoming liquor shipment, aided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, killing several gangsters and capturing George, a Capone bookkeeper. Malone shoots a gangster through the mouth (not revealing the man is already dead) to scare George into agreeing to testify against Capone. Wallace prepares to escort George from the Chicago police station to a safe house, but they are shot and killed by Nitti, who has infiltrated the station.

The answer is:","completion":"Given the context, it seems that Remy is in a situation where they must pay their rent but has spent some money on other things instead. Considering this, Remy might want to take the following steps in order to address their situation and ensure they have enough money for rent: 1. Evaluate their current financial situation: Remy should begin by determining exactly how much money they have left and whether or not it is immediately sufficient to cover their rent. This will help them develop a clearer understanding of the measures they must take to remedy their financial dilemma. 2. Prioritize expenses: In order to avoid exacerbating their financial situation, Remy should prioritize their expenses moving forward. This involves identifying which expenditures are absolutely necessary (like rent, utilities, and food) and which can be postponed or eliminated (like dining out, entertainment, or non-essential purchases). 3. Develop a budget: Remy should create a budget that accounts for their necessary expenditures, including rent, and identifies areas where they can cut back on spending. This will provide them with a structured plan for managing their finances moving forward and help ensure they have enough money for rent. 4. Increase income: If Remy finds that their current income is not enough to cover their rent and other necessary expenses, they may want to consider finding ways to increase their income. This could involve taking on additional work, selling belongings they no longer need, or seeking assistance from friends or family members. 5. Communicate with their landlord: Remy should reach out to their landlord and explain the situation. They can request a temporary extension on their rent deadline or discuss the possibility of a partial payment now, with the remaining balance to be paid later. In many cases, landlords are understanding and willing to work with tenants who are facing financial challenges, as long as they are proactive and honest about their situation. 6. Create a long-term financial plan: To avoid encountering similar financial issues in the future, Remy should develop a solid long-term financial plan. This can involve setting financial goals, establishing an emergency fund, and prioritizing saving and debt repayment. By addressing their financial situation, Remy can work towards a more financially stable future. In conclusion, Remy will likely want to evaluate their current financial situation, prioritize expenses, develop a budget, explore ways to increase income, communicate with their landlord, and create a long-term financial plan. By taking these steps, they can address their current financial predicament and work towards preventing similar issues in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. \\"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\\" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \\"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\\" \\"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue in the eating experience.\\" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of \\"food sound salience\\" on quantity of food consumed during a meal. In one experiment, participants were given snacks to eat while they wore headphones playing either loud or quiet noises. The ones loud enough to mask the sound of chewing made subjects eat more -- 4 pretzels compared to 2.75 pretzels for the \\"quiet\\" group. In another of their experiments they found that just having people hear chewing sounds through an advertisement can decrease the amount they eat. Elder and Morh call this the \\"Crunch Effect.\\" The main takeaway of their work should be the idea of mindfulness, they said. Being more mindful of not just the taste and physical appearance of food, but also of the sound it makes can help consumers to eat less. \\"When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,\\" Elder said. \\"The effects may not...

The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's \\"voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain,\\" as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: \\"Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side.\\"An earlier version of \\"Full on Idle\\", Title TK's eighth track, was released on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of \\"Full on Idle\\" sound almost the same, but The Village Voice's Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardian's Betty Clarke cited the line \\"Obey your colorist, bleach it all away\\" as an example of Title TK's amusing, off-center lyrics. On \\"Sinister Foxx\\", Deal repeatedly sings \\"Has anyone seen the iguana?\\" She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: \\"Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana.\\" Another line, \\"I'm in beer class every Thursday night\\", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk.

And it seemed that the other birds all liked to stay with _ When he looked at his own feathers, they were as black as coal. The raven was very angry with the swan. \\"How can the swan have such wonderful feathers?\\" said the raven. What should he do with his feathers? He thought it over and over. Then, the raven decided that he also wanted to have white feathers like the swan's. From that day on, the raven began to live like the swan. He moved his home from the woods to the lake. He also started to eat water plants like the swan. He tried his best to talk and dance with the other birds. The most important was that each day, the raven would wash his feathers, hoping that they would turn white. Even he went to the nearby rivers and ponds to wash his feathers because he thought the water in the lakes was not enough for him to wash them. But no matter how hard he washed his feathers, they remained black. As he ate only water plants, he soon grew thinner and thinner. Not many days later, the raven died. Question: Why was the raven angry with the swan? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The raven was angry with the swan because he saw the swan's beautiful white feathers, which were in stark contrast to his own black feathers.

The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components, in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept. Jehovah's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"AB is often considered the \\"universal donor\\" for plasma. The context provided centers around the blood transfusion practices and beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses. They do not accept whole blood transfusions due to their religious teachings but may accept certain blood plasma fractions based on individual discretion. The Watch Tower Society, the organizational body of Jehovah's Witnesses, has created documents that allow members to define their preferences regarding blood fractions and treatments during medical procedures. The mention of blood plasma fractions in this context points towards the broader subject of blood transfusions and the concept of a \\"universal donor.\\" In medical terms, a universal donor refers to a blood or plasma type that can be safely transfused into anyone regardless of their blood type. Blood types are determined by the presence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells and antibodies in plasma. For red blood cells, the universal donor is Type O negative blood. This blood type can be safely given to recipients with any blood type because it lacks A, B, and Rh antigens, which reduces the risk of a transfusion reaction. However, when it comes to plasma, being a universal donor means it can be combined with any blood type without conflict. AB plasma is considered the universal donor in this case, because it does not have anti-A or anti-B antibodies. As a result, it can be safely transfused to individuals with any blood type (A, B, AB, or O) without causing a negative immune reaction. Going back to the context of Jehovah's Witnesses, it is important to note that while AB plasma may be the universal donor for plasma transfusions, members of this faith still have the right to specify their preferences and restrictions concerning blood plasma fractions, potentially making even AB plasma ineligible for use in certain cases. In conclusion, AB is considered the universal donor for plasma transfusions, as it does not carry anti-A or anti-B antibodies, making it compatible with all blood types. However, within the context of Jehovah's Witnesses, it is essential to remember that members have the authority to determine their personal acceptance of specific blood plasma fractions and treatments in a medical setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What part of the eye is enlarged in the animal that are not thought to have a good sense of taste? Answer the above question based on the context below: The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. I am facing a new situation today: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would France have lower or higher labor supply? A:","completion":"Using the knowledge acquired from the background article on the Laffer curve, one can infer that since France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate, it would likely have a lower labor supply. This is because, according to the Laffer curve theory, when tax rates are above the critical rate, a decrease in tax rates would lead to an increase in labor supply and ultimately an increase in government revenue. Since France has a higher tax rate in comparison to Germany, it would likely experience a lower labor supply due to the disincentive effect of higher taxes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Telltale's 'Game of Thrones' Promises Five Playable Characters, 2014 Start Date Information is starting to trickle out about Telltale’s upcoming game set in the Game of Thrones universe, which is necessary considering one piece of that information is that Telltale is promising a 2014 kick-off for at least the first episode. That’s sooner than many imagined, given that until this point we’ve known nearly nothing at all about the upcoming story game, but now that’s beginning to change just a bit. The latest piece of news is that Telltale is expanding on their “double protagonist” format of Tales from the Borderlands, and their Game of Thrones title will actually have five playable characters, all from the same family. “In Game of Thrones we’re taking that multi-protagonist design even further with five playable characters from the same family whose choices affect everyone in the family,” said senior vice president of publishing Steve Allison to IBTimes UK, “And that adds a whole new layer to things that we’re really excited about.” IGN speculates based on the three teasers for the game so far that it takes place during a relatively current time period on the show, where Stannis Baratheon is trying to quell the Bolton’s takeover of the north. The game will supposedly feature one of the forest clans/families affect by the conflict. This would line the game up just about where the show is right now, if not a little bit after, yet feature entirely new characters not seen in the books or the show. The announcement of five playable characters has led many fans to believe that there will be one playable character for each of the series’ five episodes, and what one does in one episode would affect all the others down the road. And obviously this format of five members of one family echoes the book’s central idea of following half a dozen Starks around in the narrative (until horrible things happen to all of them). The one character per episode idea seems logical, but in practice it would actually not echo the format of the book or the show all that well. To play as one character and then never return to them would be odd, and wouldn’t really allow the player to form a connection with them, unlike say, Lee from The Walking Dead or Bigby from The Wolf Among Us. Similarly, if one two-hour episode is broken up into the perspectives of two or three characters, that could also be a bit jarring given the limited time there is to work with. Perhaps since Telltale’s Game of Thrones license is so valuable, they might expand to either longer episodes or more of them, though we haven’t heard anything to that effect yet. Either way, it will be an interesting challenge working with five leads. Most games that are a lot longer than Telltale’s often have trouble splitting the narrative between even two characters, much less five. They’ll have to have a very tight script for this to work. The end of the year is quickly approaching, so expect more and more information about Telltale’s Game of Thrones to start pouring forth soon, including screenshots and actual video, hopefully. I’m excited to see what they do with the property, and they should be able to shake off the mediocrity of past Game of Thrones video game attempts.

Jessica was a careless individual.. (2). Kayla was a careless individual..","completion":"Jessica gave a very good explanation about the math problem, but Kayla did not because Kayla was a careless individual. In this scenario, we can see that there is a clear difference between Jessica and Kayla's approach towards the math problem. Jessica seems to be more diligent on her explanation, showcasing an understanding of the material and a strong ability to relay that information to others. This likely stems from her dedication to her studies, practicing the material and asking questions when needed. It is also possible that Jessica has a natural intuition for math, allowing her to comprehend the problems quicker and more efficiently than her peers. Additionally, Jessica's communication skills may be on point, making her explanations clear and easy to follow. On the other hand, Kayla is described as a careless individual. This indicates that she lacks the attentiveness necessary to fully comprehend the math problem and provide a helpful explanation. This carelessness could manifest in a variety of ways, such as neglecting to study the material, not paying attention in class, or failing to work through the problem step by step. Consequently, her lack of focus and dedication to the subject results in a subpar understanding of the math problem and an inability to effectively explain it to others. Kayla's carelessness can result from a multitude of factors. It could be due to disinterest in the subject or a lack of self-confidence in her abilities. External factors, like distractions in her personal or home life, could also affect her ability to focus on her studies. It is crucial to address these underlying issues in order to help Kayla improve her attention to detail and overall performance in math. To assist Kayla in becoming less careless, it would be beneficial to establish a study plan that includes practicing math problems, seeking additional resources like tutoring, and participating actively in class discussions. Additionally, improving her organizational and time management skills can help her prioritize her studies and make the most of her study time. Cultivating a healthy relationship with the subject and fostering a growth mindset will also play a vital role in her progress. In conclusion, the sentence highlights a contrast between the approaches of Jessica and Kayla, with the latter's carelessness causing her to falter in effectively explaining the math problem. By addressing the root causes behind Kayla's carelessness and implementing strategies to improve her understanding and dedication to the subject, she can ultimately achieve better results and develop the ability to provide valuable explanations similar to Jessica."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What are the precise differences between the absolute and relative grading systems? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick your answer from: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"2). yes Both questions are inquiring about the same information, which is the difference between absolute grading and relative grading systems in universities. Now, I will provide a detailed and long answer to explain the differences between the absolute and the relative grading systems. Absolute Grading: Absolute grading, also known as criterion-referenced grading, is a system where students are assessed based on a predefined set of standards or criteria. In an absolute grading system, each student's performance is compared against these established criteria rather than the performance of their peers. Grades are assigned based on how well the student meets or exceeds the specified standards. The absolute grading system has the following characteristics: 1. Clear standards: In this system, the university or professor establishes specific, measurable criteria that must be met for each grade level. 2. Individual performance: Students are evaluated individually, and their performance is not influenced by the performance of their classmates. 3. Consistency: The criteria for each grade level remain constant throughout the course or program, providing a consistent measurement of student performance. 4. Mastery: Absolute grading rewards students for mastering predetermined standards or learning objectives. Advantages of Absolute Grading: 1. Fairness: Since students are assessed based on their individual performance and not in comparison to their peers, it is considered fairer for students with diverse skill levels and backgrounds. 2. Clarity: Absolute grading provides clear expectations for students and allows them to understand what they need to achieve to receive a particular grade. 3. Encourages collaboration: Since students are not competing against each other for limited high grades, the absolute grading system fosters a cooperative learning environment, where students can work together and support each other. Relative Grading: Relative grading, also known as norm-referenced grading or curve grading, is a grading system where students are ranked based on their performance relative to their classmates or the entire class. In this system, grades are distributed based on the distribution of students' scores, usually following a bell curve or another predetermined distribution. The relative grading system has the following characteristics: 1. Comparison to peers: In this system, a student's performance is evaluated in comparison to the performance of their classmates, and grades are assigned based on the rank order of students' scores. 2. Flexible criteria: The criteria for each grade level may vary depending on the performance of the entire class, as the goal is to achieve a specific distribution of grades. 3. Competition: Relative grading creates a competitive environment, as students must compete against each other for higher grades. Advantages of Relative Grading: 1. Maintains standards: Relative grading can be used to maintain high academic standards by ensuring that only a certain percentage of students achieve top grades. 2. Adjusts for variation: Because the criteria for assigning grades can be adjusted based on the performance of the entire class, relative grading accommodates variations in the level of difficulty across different courses, instructors, or academic years. 3. Differentiates students: Relative grading enables universities to differentiate between high and low-performing students. This is particularly important in competitive fields or for students applying to graduate programs or jobs where the employers want to identify the top-performing candidates. In summary, the primary difference between absolute and relative grading systems is how student performance is assessed and graded. Absolute grading evaluates students based on their individual performance against predetermined criteria, whereas relative grading ranks students according to their performance in comparison to their peers. Each system has its own advantages and is suited for different educational contexts and purposes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A furniture store stocks a broad range of furniture, which includes various types of tables. These could be dining tables, coffee tables, bedside tables, study tables, or any other type of table one might need. Here, customers have the freedom to choose from different styles, materials, sizes, and price ranges based on their individual preferences and needs. One might argue that you might find a table in a kitchen, hallway, or apartment, and this is indeed true.

Please answer the following question: Article: If you travel to a new exhibition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers, you will have chances to see some meat-eating plants. Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink.

Write an article with the title: \\"Two injured in shooting at SF’s Mission and 24th\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Two Injured in Shooting at SF’s Mission and 24th Introduction Late last night, at the intersection of Mission Street and 24th, San Francisco witnessed yet another shooting that left two individuals injured and raised concerns among the community. The shooting shook the area around 11 pm, which had been typically bustling with activity - home to shops, restaurants, the 24th Street Mission BART station, and frequented by locals and tourists alike. This unfortunate event reignites the discussions around gun control, public safety, and the role of law enforcement agents in American societies. Eyewitness Accounts According to several eyewitnesses who spoke to local reporters, occupants of two different cars engaged in an argument around the intersection of Mission and 24th. Matters escalated quickly, which eventually led to the gunfire. Those at the scene reported hearing multiple gunshots, with some accounts suggesting around five to six shots fired. Amidst the chaos, pedestrians scrambled to seek safety in various nearby establishments, fueling an atmosphere of panic and distress. The Victims The two victims, a 27-year-old male and a 21-year-old female, were both wounded during the incident. Onlookers provided initial assistance, while the victims were quickly transported to the hospital. The male victim suffered injuries in his arms and torso, and the female received injuries on her legs. While the injuries were non-life-threatening, the shocked victims remain under medical supervision as they recover from the traumatic experience. The families of the victims have asked for privacy while they navigate these difficult times. The Investigation Police officers promptly arrived at the scene and cordoned off the area. Early on, investigators identified bullet casings and shattered glass on the ground. Mission Street remained closed for hours, between 24th and 25th streets, as investigators procured more evidence, conducted interviews, and reviewed surveillance footage. The San Francisco police department is currently on the lookout for suspects and have asked the community to share any information that could lead to their apprehension. Crime Rate in San Francisco's Mission District Although several community-building initiatives and cultural activities have made the Mission District a vibrant neighborhood, violent incidents in the area are not uncommon. The rate of gun violence in the district has been a growing concern in recent years. Such violent incidents have had lasting impacts on the community's sense of security, forcefully reminding residents of the underbelly that exists within their much-beloved neighborhood. The Ongoing Debate This event further fuels the ongoing debate on gun violence in America. Critics of the current gun control legislation argue that it isn't enough to reduce the rates of gun-related incidents across the nation. They say that the lack of effective gun control policies in many American states can directly link to the violence that incessantly plagues many communities' safety. Moving Forward While the nation continues to grapple with the conundrum of gun violence, ensuring the safety and well-being of the Mission District community remains a priority. It is crucial to combine efforts from both citizens and the administrative bodies to bring forth a safer and more peaceful environment for everyone. In the days to come, the Mission District must move forward together in addressing the roots of gun-related crimes and pushing for stronger and more effective gun control reforms. Until such systemic changes are made, the residents of Mission Street and 24th, like many other communities, must continue to cope with the uncertainty of their safety in their own neighborhoods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the field of logic and reasoning, entailment is a term that refers to a relationship between two statements or propositions where if the first statement or proposition (the premise) is true, then the second one (the hypothesis) must also be true, regardless of the situation at hand. Looking at the given premise and hypothesis, Premise: \\"He _told_ you to do that.\\" Hypothesis: \\"He'd never tell you to do something like that.\\" If we accept the premise, which is \\"He _told_ you to do that\\", it directly states that \\"he\\" issued a directive or instruction for you to do something. This in regard signals that he has at some point impelled you to do something, whatever that might be. Now comparing this to the hypothesis: \\"He'd never tell you to do something like that.\\" This statement suggests the absolute non-existence of a situation where \\"he\\" would instruct you to do \\"something like that\\". It's presenting an absolute declaration that \\"he\\" hasn't and wouldn't instruct or order you to do a certain thing. If we assume that the premise is true, the hypothesis, under this circumstance, cannot be true. This is simply because if \\"He _told_ you to do that\\" is true, it directly contradicts the statement \\"He'd never tell you to do something like that\\".

On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was forced to turn down a song since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single? ? Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

Claimed they removed the bombs fearing children would play with them.","completion":"Title: Two Dorset Beachgoers Unveil Cold War Remnants, Carry Unexploded Bombs to Safety In a remarkable sequence of events captured on camera, Alan Barlow and Jason Kelly uncovered a piece of Cold War history on a tranquil Dorset beach and selflessly chose to remove potentially life-threatening unexploded shells, slung haphazardly across their shoulders. The shells believed to have been fired from a Chieftain tank, a prominent and powerful military vehicle during the Cold War, had remained dormant and hidden on the Dorset beach for decades. The reasons behind the tank firing exercises on the beach are unclear, but it highlights the extensive military activity that took place during that tumultuous time in our global history. Upon making this startling discovery, Barlow and Kelly took a moment to weigh the potential consequences of their find. Their unfathomable concern for the safety of others around them led them to the decision of carrying away the unexploded bombs by themselves, despite the evident risk involved. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) was quick to take action following the revelation, charging Barlow and Kelly with possession of a projectile. As law-abiding citizens, both individuals pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them. In a show of leniency, the court recognized their actions as well-intentioned and handed them a conditional discharge. In their defense, Barlow and Kelly claimed they removed the bombs out of fear that unsuspecting children could stumble upon the relics while playing on the beach, unaware of the inherent danger they possess. The decision to handle the treacherous devices themselves was driven by urgency and an earnest desire to protect the public. The incident has not only brought attention to the potential threats lurking in seemingly innocent and peaceful locations but also underscored the need for heightened public awareness and a more robust clearance strategy for unexploded ordnance. This episode serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of promptly informing the authorities when confronted with an emergency situation, rather than taking matters into one's own hands - no matter the courage and good intentions involved. In the face of life-altering consequences, Alan Barlow and Jason Kelly's selfless actions have saved an untold number of beachgoers from potential harm. Their story highlights the presence of historical remnants contaminating our environment, as well as the bravery of ordinary individuals who, when put to the test, take extraordinary measures to keep their communities safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 39*b + 46*b + 173*b - 18312 = -3090 for b, we first need to simplify the equation. Step 1: Combine the like terms. All the \\"b\\" terms can be added: 39*b + 46*b + 173*b = (39 + 46 + 173) * b = 258 * b So, the equation can now be written as: 258*b -18312 = -3090 Step 2: Isolate the variable, b. To do this, we should add 18312 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side: 258*b = -3090 + 18312 Step 3: Calculate the value of the right side of the equation: -3090 + 18312 = 15222 So, our equation now becomes: 258*b = 15222 Step 4: Solve for b. To find the value of b, we will divide both sides of the equation by 258: b = 15222 / 258 Step 5: Calculate the value of b: b ≈ 58.992248 The solution for the equation 39*b + 46*b + 173*b - 18312 = -3090 is b ≈ 58.992248."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours.

Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak.

Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English language films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award, among six nominations. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. Bipasha Basu was born on 7 January 1979 to a Bengali family in Delhi. Her father, Hirak, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Mamta, is a homemaker. She has one elder sister, Bidisha, and one younger sister, Vijayeta. According to Basu, her name means \\"dark deep desire\\", and is also a river's name. She added \\"Due to my dusky skin, I was considered ugly in my younger years.\\" In Delhi, Basu lived at Pamposh Enclave, Nehru Place, till the age of eight and studied at Apeejay High School. Her family then shifted to Kolkata, where she attended Bhavan's Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, located in Bidhannagar. In her school, Basu was appointed as the head girl and was fondly called 'Lady Goonda' due to her short and commanding personality. She remarked \\"As a child, I was a tomboy and I was pampered a lot, due to which I became very naughty. I used to keep a stick in my hand and straighten out all the colony boys if they acted smart. I used to be very short as a child and I was the monitor in school. When the tall boys would be up to mischief, I'd jump on their back during breaks and pull their hair and beat them up\\". Basu was enrolled in medical science studies until twelfth standard, but switched to commerce thereafter. In 1996, Basu was spotted at a hotel in Kolkata by the model Mehr Jesia Rampal, who suggested she take up modelling. That year, she participated in and eventually won the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest (organised by Ford), thereby representing India at Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest in Miami. She later appeared in the Calida commercial with her then-boyfriend Dino Morea, which was controversial for picturing them sultrily; she had some protesters outside her house after that.

In the mid 1970s, various American groups (some with ties to Downtown Manhattan's punk scene, including Television and Suicide) had begun expanding on the vocabulary of punk music. Midwestern groups such as Pere Ubu and Devo drew inspiration from the region's derelict industrial environments, employing conceptual art techniques, musique concrète and unconventional verbal styles that would presage the post-punk movement by several years. A variety of subsequent groups, including New York-based Talking Heads and Boston-based Mission of Burma, combined elements of punk with art school sensibilities. In 1978, the former band began a series of collaborations with British ambient pioneer and ex-Roxy Music member Brian Eno, experimenting with Dada-influenced lyrical techniques, dance music, and African polyrhythms.

Energy enters ecosystems in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds. Sunlight, which consists of various colors of the spectrum, is absorbed by plants through a process known as photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a sugar that the plants can then use for energy and growth. This process generates oxygen as a byproduct and is essential to life on Earth. In addition to sunlight, some ecosystems also rely on chemical compounds as an energy source. For example, in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, specialized bacteria and other microorganisms can convert chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide into usable energy through a process called chemosynthesis. These microorganisms serve as the base of the food chain in these unique ecosystems, providing energy to a variety of other organisms. In both cases, the energy that enters the ecosystem in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds is transferred through the food web as organisms consume other organisms.

It rises at an altitude of on Plynlimon, close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes, in the Cambrian Mountains of mid Wales. It then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, with the county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester on its banks. With an average discharge of at Apperley, Gloucestershire, the Severn is the greatest river in terms of water flow in England and Wales. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Abergavenny (archaically \\"Abergafenni\\" meaning \\"Mouth of the River Gavenny\\") is a market town in Monmouthshire, Wales. It is located west of Monmouth on the A40 and A465 roads, from the English border. Originally the site of a Roman fort, Gobannium, it became a medieval walled town within the Welsh marches. The town contains the remains of a medieval stone castle built soon after the Norman conquest of Wales. The town hosted the 2016 National Eisteddfod of Wales. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - The tidal range is the vertical difference between the high tide and the succeeding low tide. Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. The tidal range is not constant, but changes depending on where the sun and the moon are. - Pen y Fan is the highest peak in south Wales, situated in the Brecon Beacons National Park. At above sea-level, it is also the highest British peak south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia. The twin summits of Pen y Fan and Corn Du at 873 m (2,864 ft) were formerly referred to as Cadair Arthur or 'Arthur's Seat'. - A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges. High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt. It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark. - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands. It is located in Snowdonia National Park (\\") in Gwynedd, and has been described as \\"probably the busiest mountain in Britain\\". It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Monmouthshire is a county in south east Wales. The name derives from the historic county of Monmouthshire of which it covers the eastern 60%. The largest town is Abergavenny. Other towns and large villages are Caldicot, Chepstow, Monmouth, Magor and Usk. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

In a narrow sense, the name refers to the range of Old Red Sandstone peaks which lie to the south of Brecon. Sometimes referred to as \\"the central Beacons\\" they include South Wales' highest mountain, Pen y Fan. The range forms the central section of the Brecon Beacons National Park (\\"Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog\\"), a designation which also encompasses ranges both to the east and the west of \\"the central Beacons\\". This much wider area is also commonly referred to as \\"the Brecon Beacons\\", and it includes the Black Mountains to the east as well as the similarly named but quite distinct Black Mountain to the west. The highest peaks include Fan Brycheiniog to the west and Pen y Fan in the central part. They share the same basic geology as the central range, and so exhibit many similar features, such the north-facing escarpment and glacial features such as lakes and cwms below the escarpment. They all fall within the border of the national park. - West Wales is the western region of Wales. Some definitions of West Wales include only Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, which historically comprised the Welsh principality of \\"Deheubarth\\" and was called \\"South West Wales\\" in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). Other definitions include Swansea and Neath Port Talbot but exclude Ceredigion. The \\"West Wales and the Valleys\\" NUTS area includes more westerly parts of North Wales.

It is known as a nesting - place for gulls , cormorants and other seabirds , which are regularly seen and ringed there . - Mid Wales (or simply \\"Y Canolbarth\\" \\"The Midlands\\") is the name given to the central region of Wales. The Mid Wales Regional Committee of the National Assembly for Wales covered the counties of Ceredigion and Powys and the area of Gwynedd that had previously been the district of Meirionydd. A similar definition is used by the BBC. The Wales Spatial Plan defines a region known as \\"Central Wales\\" which covers Ceredigion and Powys. If Mid Wales is classed as Ceredigion and Powys, the area would be 6,962 square kilometres (about the size of Cumbria). - Chepstow is a town in Monmouthshire, Wales, adjoining the border with Gloucestershire, England.

Since 2011, Swansea has started to expand into a larger region known as the Swansea Bay City Region. After combining with other councils, it now includes Tenby and other parts of West Wales, its population including these areas an estimated 685,051. The chairman of the new region is Sir Terry Matthews. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean.

Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.

Article: Avoid taking sides in any confrontations between your parents and your fiancé. This not only will make one side feel betrayed, but may make the situation even worse. The best thing you can do to diffuse the situation is to remain neutral and let both sides know that you care about them and respect their feelings. You might say something like, “I know that there are difficult feelings on both sides. Let’s just all calm down and take a step back.” Don’t let yourself get dragged into an “It’s them or me” ultimatum; keep saying “I love each of you deeply and I know we can work this out, or at least learn to tolerate one another.” You may be tempted to give your fiancé the impression that your parents really like them. You might not want to let your parents even know that you’re engaged. The best thing to do when your parents dislike your fiancé is to be honest with everyone about what’s going on. For example, you might have to tell your fiancé, “I know you really like my parents, but they don’t care for you very much. I hope that will change some as they get to know you.” Or, you might need to tell your parents, “I know you don't like my fiancé, but we are in love and are planning to get married. I don't want this to come between us.” The truth will come out eventually, so it’s best to stay ahead of things and address problems before they fester. Your parents and your fiancé may never see completely eye-to-eye. However, they can reach a compromise that all of you can cope with. Sit down with your parents and your fiancé and try to work out a plan for how you all can interact and be a family together without any negativity. For example, you might tell your parents, “I know you may never fully embrace Jamie. But we’re going to all be a family soon no matter what, so we need to sit down and work out a way to manage our problems together.” In some cases, letting your parents get to know your fiancé better might help; in others, it may be best to limit contact to necessary, defined situations.

This staggering sum indicates a significant challenge for the company as it grapples with increasing competition, a shifting market landscape, and the need to reinforce its position as one of the leading tech companies worldwide. In this article, we will take a closer look at what led to this mammoth loss, the impact this setback might have on the company, its stakeholders, and its future prospects, and how Lenovo plans to bounce back from this troubling financial report. Key Factors Leading to the Loss: 1. Higher Restructuring Costs: The primary factor driving this loss was the higher-than-anticipated restructuring costs. Lenovo has been in the process of revamping its business model, organizational structure, and supply chain management to better serve its evolving customer base and mitigate emerging market challenges. However, despite the anticipated benefits of such restructuring, the costs incurred so far have exceeded projections and placed a significant burden on Lenovo's financial health. 2. Sluggish Market Performance: Beyond restructuring costs, another factor that contributed to Lenovo's loss is the slowdown in the PC and smartphone markets. With competition intensifying and customers increasingly opting for other cutting-edge devices (such as tablets and wearables), Lenovo has struggled to keep pace with changing market dynamics and has seen its sales plummet. 3. Currency Fluctuations: The ongoing economic uncertainty and the fluctuations in global currency exchange rates have also taken a toll on Lenovo's financial performance. As a multinational company with a significant portion of its revenue generated from international markets, Lenovo is highly susceptible to currency-related swings. The current volatile global economic climate has only added to the company's woes, compounding its losses. Consequences of the Loss 1. Share Price Decline: As a direct result of this financial setback, Lenovo's share price has nosedived. This is a significant concern for the company's shareholders and could potentially deter future investors from putting their money behind the tech giant. 2. Loss of Market Confidence: Lenovo's slide into the red is bound to affect the market's confidence in the company. This could, in turn, impact Lenovo's ability to secure deals, build strategic partnerships, and attract talent - all crucial components to succeed in the competitive tech arena. 3. Resource Allocation: With reduced financial resources at its disposal, Lenovo might have to make tough choices when it comes to funding research and development initiatives, marketing campaigns, and other operational activities that help maintain its market position and drive growth. Lenovo's Future Outlook and Recovery Plan Despite the significant net loss and the associated challenges, Lenovo has a robust recovery plan in place. The company remains committed to its restructuring strategy, which it believes will yield long-term benefits. 1. Focus on High-Growth Areas: Lenovo plans to concentrate its efforts on high-growth areas, particularly in the mobile and data center markets. The company believes that doubling down on these sectors will help offset the slowdown in the PC and smartphone markets and position it for future success. 2. Streamlined Operations and Supply Chain: Lenovo's restructuring endeavors also include a renewed focus on streamlining operations and optimizing its supply chain. These efforts are aimed at improving productivity, reducing costs, and enhancing the company's capacity to better serve its customers. 3. Innovation and Diversification: To stay ahead in a competitive market, Lenovo is investing heavily in research and development to bring forth innovative products and technology solutions. Additionally, the company plans to diversify its product and services portfolio to cater to a broader customer base and mitigate business risks. Conclusion: Lenovo's 714m net loss is undoubtedly a significant setback for the company. The substantial restructuring costs, sluggish market performance, and currency fluctuations have all contributed to this downturn for the tech giant. However, Lenovo's recovery plan, which focuses on high-growth areas, streamlined operations, and product innovation, holds promise for the company's future. To regain its position as a leading computer and smartphone manufacturer, Lenovo will need to demonstrate resilience and agility in navigating the complex challenges it currently faces. The coming months and years will be pivotal in determining the company's trajectory, as it seeks to bounce back from this substantial financial loss and regain the confidence of its stakeholders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: In large first-year classes, there might not be anyone taking attendance, which means that you won’t get in trouble the same way you may have in high school. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go to class, though, and some teachers will have an attendance policy. More importantly, skipping class means missing out on valuable learning. Don’t make your life more difficult by forcing yourself to cram come exam time. College is also expensive, and not going to class means that you are wasting a lot of your and/or your parents’ money—anywhere from 50 to 150 per one hour of class. Do the readings, taking notes as you do so. You’ll retain much more if you read actively, and your notes will help you out a ton when exam time rolls around. Participate if the class calls for it. Many college students hate or are afraid of speaking in front of groups, but you will get so much more out of your classes—and will enjoy them so much more—if you can get past this. Don’t be afraid of being wrong—your professor just wants you to try, and probably wasn’t asking a question with a “right” or “wrong” answer to being with. You should spend the same amount of time on your schoolwork as you would on a full-time job—at least forty hours a week. Bank on spending an average of two hours outside of class for every hour you spend in class. The balance will vary by subject (labs, for instance, will tilt more toward in-class time), but your library or dorm room is where a lot of the really hard work will take place. Some people plagiarize because they think they can get away with it; others do so because they honestly don’t know what it means. Either way, you are responsible, and you will get caught. Many schools have very harsh penalties for this behavior, including automatically failing the class and/or including a special note on your transcript. Obvious plagiarism includes copying someone else's work and presenting it as your own and using someone else's words or ideas without citing her. Not using quotation marks around quotations is also plagiarism, as is giving inaccurate or incorrect information about a source. (It's especially bad if you fabricate a source.) Bad paraphrasing is also plagiarism. A paraphrase condenses the \\"gist\\" of an idea into your own words. However, you may be plagiarizing if you retain most of the original's words, especially if you use the same basic sentence structure or the passages are substantially similar in length or style. Academic dishonesty more generally can include asking people to help you when you have been told to do all your own work, working together on a project if collaboration hasn't been assigned, and paying others to do work for you. Dirty little secret: many professors sit at their desks during office hours, waiting and hoping for someone, anyone to stop by. They will appreciate you so much if you are that person. If you have a question, this is a great way to ask it because it will help your professor put a name to your face. But consider stopping by early in the semester just to say hi and introduce yourself. Be reasonable about your expectations. Your professors won't proofread papers for you or give you essay topics. However, they're usually very happy to talk about your ideas with you to help you figure them out. For many college students, texting comes more naturally than emailing, but you can't expect your professors to give you their cell phone numbers. If you want to stay on top of your academics, you will need to check your email regularly. This is where you will see announcements from your teachers, department, etc. If your courses use online course management, such as Blackboard, check these regularly too. Often, assignments and grades will only be posted here--if you don't check them regularly, you miss out. This goes for both the physical location and online databases. Your professors will assign a lot of these, especially at the beginning, but you will also need to learn how to do research on your own. Consider scheduling an orientation with a librarian, especially if you have never used a brick-and-mortar library before. You are sure not to be the only one, so don’t be embarrassed. Most libraries have reference librarians for specific areas, such as hard sciences, music, or English. If you have a big project, it's a good idea to ask for a consultation with the reference librarian in your subject. She stays up to date with all the latest research and can guide you to the best sources. No matter who you are, you will probably read things that you don’t agree with. This is intentional—your professors aim to assign readings from many different perspectives, so they are assigning things that they don’t agree with, either. You don’t have to agree with the writers who challenge your beliefs, but do try to figure out where they are coming from and what makes them tick—that’s probably part of why they were assigned, anyway. Colleges and universities will require that you fulfill a certain number of credits in several different areas: general education (possibly broken down by subject matter), classes for your major, and electives. Meet with your advisor regularly to make sure you are staying on track—otherwise you might find yourself having to pay for a summer session or an extra semester that you weren’t planning on. If you are an engineering major, take a literature course. Poets, try biology. (These are just examples.) Either way, you will be exposed to new people, new ideas, and perhaps a new subject that you didn’t know you were interested in. Employers are often more interested in candidates who can do a wide range of things, such as write a coherent sentence and analyze formulas, rather than people whose focus was so specialized that they can't handle the wide-ranging demands of the modern job market.","completion":"This article highlights the importance of attending and actively participating in college classes as skipping classes can lead to missed learning opportunities and wasted money. Students should aim to spend around 40 hours a week on schoolwork and engage in active reading and note-taking to retain information better. It is crucial to avoid plagiarism and academic dishonesty, as strict penalties may apply. Building relationships with professors, checking emails, and learning how to navigate libraries make a significant difference in a student's college experience. Exposure to different perspectives through assigned readings helps expand their knowledge. Meeting with advisors regularly ensures students stay on track for graduation and exploring various subjects outside their major can provide a well-rounded education that may impress future employers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oct. 27, 2013 A crane lifts a burned car while residents inspect the site of a car bomb attack in the Sha’ab neighborhood of Baghdad. Ten cars rigged with explosives blew up in predominantly Shiite Muslim areas in Baghdad on Sunday, killing dozens, police said. Karim Kadim/AP Nearly two years after the U.S. troop withdrawal, Iraq is in the midst of a deepening security crisis as an al-Qaeda affiliate wages a relentless campaign of attacks, sending the death toll soaring to its highest level since 2008. In the latest violence, nine car bombs tore through markets and police checkpoints in Baghdad on Sunday, killing dozens of people. The bloody campaign has virtually erased the security gains made in the past five years. More than 5,300 Iraqis have been killed this year. Sunday’s attacks occurred just three days before Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is scheduled to arrive in Washington, where he will take part in meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill. At the top of his agenda is a request for more U.S. help in the fight against the al-Qaeda affiliate, whose scope has grown to encompass neighboring Syria as well. “We need to increase the depth and width of our cooperation, to be more agile and reflect the seriousness of the situation in Iraq,” Iraq’s ambassador to Washington, Lukman Faily, said in a telephone interview. “In our discussions, we will highlight the urgent need for the approval and quick delivery of military sales.” View Graphic A single month's death toll from violence in Iraq. At least 40 people died Sunday in attacks on mostly Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad, according to an Interior Ministry official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name. In addition, a suicide bomber plowed his car into a group of soldiers in the northern city of Mosul, killing 14, according to a local police official. More than 600 people have been killed in Iraq this month, after extraordinary bloodshed left 880 dead in September. The surge in violence is largely, though not exclusively, due to attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, an outgrowth of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group is trying to undermine the Iraqi state through a relentless campaign of car bombings, assaults on security forces and assassinations. ISIS has also carried out several jailbreaks, freeing militants whom American and Iraqi forces worked for years to capture. Shattering of calm Iraq once looked as though it could be stabilizing. After a horrific sectarian war engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007, the United States sent a surge of troops and began enlisting Sunni fighters to turn against al-Qaeda. When the U.S. military withdrew at the end of 2011, militant groups were on their heels and monthly civilian death tolls were in the dozens rather than the hundreds. That period of relative safety lasted into 2012, but it began to unravel as Syria’s anti-government protest movement developed into a civil war fought along sectarian lines. Many radical Sunni fighters in Iraq and Syria have now united under the banner of ISIS. The militants consider the two nations to be different fronts in a single war with an ambitious goal. “They want a caliphate,” said Jessica Lewis, research director at the Institute for the Study of War, who has investigated the resurgence of al-Qaeda in Iraq. She was referring to the Islamic political system that ruled most Muslims after the death of the prophet Muhammad. One of the group’s most important victories came in September 2012, when militants freed about 100 inmates from a prison in Tikrit. The infusion of manpower helped the organization intensify operations this past spring, Lewis said. ISIS launched an even more devastating attack on the notorious Abu Ghraib prison on July 21, freeing more than 500 convicts who could bolster the group’s capabilities further in the coming months. “My best estimate based on [the Tikrit] example is that we’re going to see another huge growth step in operational capability in the new year,” Lewis said. Sectarian mistrust The rise of ISIS has coincided with political dysfunction in Baghdad. During Iraq’s recent years of relative calm, Maliki has consolidated power in a way that has left many Sunnis feeling disenfranchised under the Shiite-­led government. Sunni leaders complain bitterly that he has used his control of Iraq’s security forces to sideline political opponents under the pretense of combating terrorism. In the vast deserts of Anbar province in western Iraq, the government has deployed thousands of troops to patrol its nearly 400-mile-long boundary with Syria. But the border has become largely theoretical, and militants have moved across it with ease. In the atmosphere of sectarian mistrust that pervades Iraq, the Shiite-­majority federal forces have not coordinated well with the province’s mainly Sunni tribes and local police, according to Anbar’s governor, Ahmed Khalaf al-Dulaimi. Anbar has suffered at least seven major attacks in the past week, including assassinations of local political leaders, the siege of a government electricity office and assaults on checkpoints. The largest operation was an Oct. 20 attempt to storm a police compound in the city of Fallujah that includes a prison. The assault by 25 men armed with guns and mortars was ultimately repulsed, according to a police official involved in the response, but the battle lasted five hours and left four police officers dead. On the other side of the sectarian divide, Iraq’s various Shiite militias, some of which receive funding and strategic direction from Iran, appear to be stepping up operations. Public funerals throughout southern Iraq memorialize militia members who have died fighting for the regime in Syria, and there are growing signs that some militias are bringing the fight back to Iraq. In the southern Shiite- majority provinces of Basra and Dhi Qar, at least 12 members of the Sunni Sadoon tribe have been killed in recent weeks, according to a senior Basra police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Dozens more members of the tribe in Dhi Qar have reported receiving death threats, and at least eight families have fled their homes, according to Haider Salman, a municipal council leader. In Basra, the threats against Sunnis are so serious that Sheik Abdul Kareem al-Khazraji, who heads the government authority that administers Sunni religious sites, ordered mosques to close their doors because of the risk of attacks on large gatherings of worshipers. “We are directing people to pray at home, to protect their lives,” Khazraji said. To the north, militias have been active in Shiite-dominated pockets of Diyala province. Six Sunnis were killed in Muqdadiyah, according to a tribal leader in the area who identified himself as Sheik Abu Muhammad. Such incidents are haunting for Iraqis who recall the violence of the last decade. The killing rose exponentially in 2006 when attacks on Shiite religious sites prompted militias to retaliate with campaigns of sectarian killing and intimidation. The bloodshed this year has not reached those terrible peaks. But al-Qaeda’s leaders in Iraq again seem determined to use horrific violence to provoke retaliation by the government and Shiite militias. Sunday’s attacks targeted predominantly Shiite areas in Baghdad. In recent weeks, car bombs in Baghdad have targeted not only day laborers and markets, but also funerals and even a playground full of children. As the death toll mounts, Iraq is approaching national elections in April. In past years, militants have typically stepped up attacks before elections in an attempt to intimidate voters and create an atmosphere of fear. The result has been beneficial for campaigns defined by sectarian and ethnic politics. “Imagine Iraq as a ship in the middle of a storm,” Maliki said in a televised interview in early October, “and some of the cabin crew ask the captain to control the movement of the ship. How can he do this with all of the high waves?” ||||| A series of attacks including car bombings in Baghdad, an explosion at a market and a suicide assault in a northern city killed at least 66 people Sunday across Iraq, officials said, the latest in a wave of violence washing over the country.

Insurgents on Sunday unleashed a new... (Associated Press) Coordinated bombings hit Iraq multiple times each month, feeding a spike in bloodshed that has killed more than 5,000 people since April. The local branch of al-Qaida often takes responsibility for the assaults, although there was no immediate claim for Sunday's blasts. Sunday's attacks were the deadliest single-day series of assaults since Oct. 5, when 75 people were killed in violence. Police officers said that the bombs in the capital, placed in parked cars and detonated over a half-hour period, targeted commercial areas and parking lots, killing 42 people. The deadliest blasts struck in the southeastern Nahrwan district, where two car bombs exploded simultaneously, killing seven and wounding 15, authorities said. Two other explosions hit the northern Shaab and southern Abu Dashir neighborhoods, each killing six people, officials said. Other blasts hit the neighborhoods of Mashtal, Baladiyat and Ur in eastern Baghdad, the southwestern Bayaa district and the northern Sab al-Bor and Hurriyah districts. Meanwhile, in the northern city of Mosul, a suicide bomber drove his explosives-laden car into a group of soldiers as they were sealing off a street leading to a bank where troops were receiving salaries, killing 14, a police officer said. At least 30 people were wounded, the officer said. Also in Mosul, police said gunmen shot dead two off-duty soldiers in a drive-by shooting. The former insurgent stronghold of Mosul is located about 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of Baghdad. In the afternoon, a bomb blast killed four people and wounded 11 inside an outdoor market in the Sunni town of Tarmiyah, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Baghdad, authorities said. Sunday night, police said mortar shells landed on homes in a Shiite district of Madain, a town just south of Baghdad, killing four people and wounding nine, officials said. Such coordinated attacks are a favorite tactic of al-Qaida's local branch. It frequently targets civilians in markets, cafes and commercial streets in Shiite areas in an attempt to undermine confidence in the government, as well as members of the security forces. All of the car bombings Sunday in Baghdad struck Shiite neighborhoods. In Mashtal in Baghdad, police and army forces sealed off the scene as ambulances rushed to pick up the wounded. Pools of blood covered the pavement. The force of the explosion damaged number of cars and shops. At one restaurant, the blast overturned wooden benches and left broken eggs scattered on the ground. In Shaab, a crane lifted away at least 12 charred cars as cleaners swept away debris. Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures for all attacks. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to publicly release the information. Violence has spiked in Iraq since April, when the pace of killing reached levels unseen since 2008. Today's attacks bring the death toll across the country this month to 545, according to an Associated Press count. ___ Associated Press writer Sameer N.

In this scenario, it is most likely that Alex would feel betrayed by Bailey (answer B). This is because Alex's efforts and hard work on the project led to Bailey reaping the benefits, which could be perceived as taking advantage of Alex's contributions. Feeling proud of Bailey (answer A) would not be the best answer in this context, as it does not convey the probable negative emotions that Alex might experience as a result of his or her work being utilized for Bailey's benefit. Feeling conflicted about her feelings (answer C) is also less fitting in this context because the available information suggests that the main emotion experienced would be a sense of betrayal. While it is possible that Alex may have mixed feelings about the situation, the context provided directs us toward a more definitive reaction of feeling betrayed.

The basics: *Customer service was initially rocky. We exchanged a couple of phone calls, haggling about warranties and a competitor's tire price. *I finally had to call the customer relations chief at headquarters in North Scottsdale. The results: * Everything was resolved to my satisfaction * I got a new set of tires * I'm now a fan of Discount Tire. What you can learn from this: * Look at that fine print that came with the last set of tires you bought and are now replacing. Figure out whether they gave you fewer miles than they were warranted to give you. If so, you have a credit coming. MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS -- my salesman was going to ignore this part, until I pointed it out to him. In my case, this was worth about 300. * Identify the tires you want and research the price. You can almost always find them cheaper, and Discount Tires pledges it will not be undersold. (though you may have to push a bit to get them to honor that pledge.)","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed but leaning towards positive. The reviewer initially presents a complicated experience with customer service, expressing some frustration regarding the communication they had, specifically in dealing with warranties and tire price comparison. This part of the review seems to display a negative sentiment, as the customer faced some difficulties in bargaining and getting the desired outcome. However, as the review progresses, the sentiment shifts towards a more positive tone. The customer mentions getting in touch with the customer relations chief, resulting in a satisfactory resolution. Obtaining a new set of tires and turning into a fan of Discount Tire strongly suggest the improvement of the reviewer's experience and perception of the company. Towards the end of the review, the sentiment remains positive as the reviewer offers helpful advice for future customers. They emphasize the importance of understanding the warranty terms, as this saved them a significant amount of money, and recommend conducting tire price research to ensure the best deal. These helpful tips indicate that despite the initial hiccups in customer service, the overall experience was positive, and the reviewer is willing to share valuable information with others. In summary, this review portrays a mixed sentiment that transitions from negative to positive throughout the description of the customer's experience, ultimately encouraging others to consider Discount Tire as a choice for their tire needs and benefit from the reviewer's learnings."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Title: Twista Murders the whole record Review: Since hearing Twista on Royce Da 5'9\\"'s \\"Let's Go\\" Track off his Rock City LP, I've been checking out Twista ever since.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct, as it mentions the role of the Rugae in the hard palate. However, the hard palate has other functions as well. The hard palate is the bony, anterior part of the roof of the mouth, which serves several purposes: 1. Separation: It separates the oral and nasal cavities, which allows you to breathe while eating and speaking. This is important for preventing food and liquids from entering the nasal cavity, which could cause choking or infection. 2. Speech: The hard palate plays an essential role in speech production, as it provides an immovable surface against which the tongue can press to help create certain sounds, such as \\"t\\" and \\"d.\\" 3. Mastication: The hard palate supports the upper teeth and helps in the process of chewing and breaking down food. The Rugae, the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane, also facilitate the movement of food towards the back of the mouth, as stated in the answer you found.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Moralia (\\"Ethika\\"; loosely translated as \\"Morals\\" or \\"Matters relating to customs and mores\\") of the 1st-century Greek scholar Plutarch of Chaeronea is an eclectic collection of 78 essays and transcribed speeches. They provide insights into Roman and Greek life, but often are also timeless observations in their own right. Many generations of Europeans have read or imitated them, including Michel de Montaigne and the Renaissance Humanists and Enlightenment philosophers. - The Alcmaeonidae or Alcmaeonids were a powerful noble family of ancient Athens, a branch of the Neleides who claimed descent from the mythological Alcmaeon, the great-grandson of Nestor. - Alcibiades, son of Cleinias, from the deme of Scambonidae (Greek: , transliterated \\"Alkibiáds Kleiníou Skambníds\\"; c. 450 404 BC), was a prominent Athenian statesman, orator, and general. He was the last famous member of his mother's aristocratic family, the Alcmaeonidae, which fell from prominence after the Peloponnesian War. He played a major role in the second half of that conflict as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician. - Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world. - Nicias ( \\"Nikias\\"; c. 470 BC 413 BC), was an Athenian politician and general during the period of the Peloponnesian War. Nicias was a member of the Athenian aristocracy and had inherited a large fortune from his father, which was invested in the silver mines around Attica's Mt. Laurium. Following the death of Pericles in 429 BC, he became the principal rival of Cleon and the democrats in the struggle for the political leadership of the Athenian state. He was a moderate in his political views and opposed the aggressive imperialism of the democrats. His principal aim was to conclude a peace with Sparta as soon as it could be obtained on terms favourable to Athens. - Phaeax ( Greek : ) was an Athenian orator and statesman . The son of Erasistratus , his date of his birth is not known , but he was a contemporary of Nicias and Alcibiades . Plutarch ( Alcib . 13 ) says , that he and Nicias were the only rivals whom Alcibiades feared when he entered upon public life . In 422 BC , Phaeax , with two others , was sent as an ambassador to Italy and Sicily , to endeavor to persuade the Magna Graecian allies of the Athenians and the other Siceliotes to aid the Leontines against the Syracusans . He succeeded with Camarina and Agrigentum , but his failure at Gela led him to abandon the attempt as hopeless . On his way back he assisted the Athenian cause among the states of Italy . ( Thucyd . v. 4 , 5 . ) According to Theophrastus ( ap. Plut . ) it was Phaeax , and not Nicias , with whom Alcibiades united for the purpose of ostracizing Hyperbolus . Most authorities , however , are of the view that it was Nicias . ( Plut . l.c . Nic . 11 , Aristid . 7 . ) In the \`\` Lives of the Ten Orators '' ( Andoc . ) there is mention of a contest between Phaeax and Andocides , and a defence of the latter against the former . It is difficult to say exactly when this content took place . Andocides did not come into notice until after the affair of the mutilation of the Hermae . Phaeax was an engaging personality , but had no great abilities as a speaker . According to Eupolis ( ap. Plut . Alcib . 13 ) he was a fluent talker , but quite unable to speak . ( Comp . A. Gellius , N. A. i. 15 . ) Aristophanes gives a description of his style of speaking ( Equit . 1377 , etc. ) , from which it would seem that , on one occasion , he was brought to trial for some capital offence and acquitted . There has been a good deal of controversy regarding the speech against Alcibiades , commonly attributed to Andocides , which Taylor maintained to be prepared by Phaeax . Plutarch ( Alcib . 13 ) , according to the opinion of most editors , speaks of an oration against Alcibiades , as prepared by Phaeax . It seems... - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - Plutarch (\\"Ploútarkhos\\", ; later named, upon becoming a Roman citizen, Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus; c. AD 46 AD 120) was a Greek biographer and essayist, known primarily for his \\"Parallel Lives\\" and \\"Moralia\\". He is classified as a Middle Platonist. Plutarch's surviving works were written in Greek, but intended for both Greek and Roman readers. - Cleon (\\"Kleon\\", ; died 422 BCE) was an Athenian general during the Peloponnesian War. He was the first prominent representative of the commercial class in Athenian politics, although he was an aristocrat himself. His contemporaries Thucydides and Aristophanes represented him as a warmongering demagogue. - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused. - Laurium or Lavrio or Lavrion (before early 11th century BC: \\"Thorikos\\"; from Middle Ages until 1908: - \\"Ergastiria\\") is a town in southeastern part of Attica, Greece. It is the seat of the municipality of Lavreotiki. Laurium was famous in Classical antiquity for its silver mines, which was one of the chief sources of revenue of the Athenian state. The metallic silver was mainly used for coinage. The Archaeological Museum of Lavrion shows much of the story of these mines. - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by \\"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \\"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\\" etc. - Pericles (\\"Perikls\\", in Classical Attic; c. 495 429 BC) was a prominent and influential Greek statesman, orator and general of Athens during the Golden Agespecifically the time between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars.

Article:Spar, hosted by journalists Anton Berg and Martin Johnson and released via podcast platform Acast, has been examining the imprisonment of Kaj Linna for the last two years. Mr Linna was initially sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for murder and robbery. Robert Lindberg was killed in an attack in northern Sweden which also left his brother Sune injured. But a witness who had been involved in the initial trial appeared to undermine his own testimony while being interviewed for the podcast. After the episode was released, Mr Linna used the audio as part of his appeal, and a retrial was granted in December. The audio was also used in court proceedings during the retrial, which concluded at the end of May and found there had been insufficient evidence to convict Mr Linna. Mr Linna has now been released from prison and reunited with his family. In a statement, the Swedish Court of Appeal president Margareta Bergstrom said: \\"Our conclusion is that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient and therefore can not lead to a conviction.\\" \\"We're very happy and relieved. We are frankly impressed that a podcast could have this kind of impact,\\" Berg told the BBC. Acast co-founder Karl Rosander added: \\"It means so much because Kaj Linna has been in jail for 13 years. We actually helped free an innocent man, it's so amazing, and I'm happy for the journalists who wanted to look at the story.\\" The series looking at Mr Linna's case has released eight episodes so far, with each one attracting around 300,000 listeners, according to Berg. \\"We released the podcast in May 2015, and the retrial was granted by the Supreme Court in December 2016, so that process alone took a year and a half,\\" he explained. The retrial was granted partly due to the audio which had been gathered by Berg and Johnson during the production of the podcast. \\"We met with a man who was the main witness, and he came up with a different story to the one he put forward in the trial,\\" Berg said. \\"We had two different microphones in that interview, I was doing the main recording and Martin was sitting next to me and he had a stereo microphone which was there to record atmosphere. \\"The witness asked us to switch off the microphone at one point, which I did, and he started giving us details which he had not put forward in the trial. \\"When we got home, we found out that Martin's microphone had been on all the time. Then I called the man and said we had it, but strangely he said that he was fine with that and we could use the audio.\\" Mr Linna's fight for a retrial has been covered widely in the Swedish media since the audio came to light. \\"The Supreme Court listened to the interview with the witness, and when they did they made quite a fuss about this decision and they granted the retrial. They said that it was crucial, because there were things that the courts hadn't been told before,\\" Berg said. \\"The case had been built on the testimony of the man we spoke to, and after we interviewed him, he started giving us a new version of events. He was clearly not trustworthy or reliable.\\" He added: \\"I hope the police will now further investigate this crime, because it's a terrible thing that's happened. It's a murder and robbery, and now it's unsolved again.\\" It is the longest-served sentence to be followed by a retrial in Sweden's legal history. Speaking to Swedish media on Thursday, Mr Linna said: \\"My time in jail was completely wasted, worthless.\\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The brother, surnamed Reed, dies shortly after adopting Jane. His wife, Mrs. Sarah Reed, and their three children (John, Eliza and Georgiana) neglect and abuse Jane, for they resent Mr. Reed's preference for the little orphan in their midst. In addition, they dislike Jane's plain looks and quiet yet passionate character. Thus, the novel begins with young John Reed bullying Jane, who retaliates with unwonted violence. Jane is blamed for the ensuing fight, and Mrs. Reed has two of the servants drag her off and lock her up in the red-room, the unused chamber where Mr. Reed had died. Still locked in that night, Jane sees a light and panics, thinking that her uncle's ghost has come. Her scream rouses the house, but Mrs. Reed just locks up Jane for longer. Then Jane has a fit and passes out. A doctor, Mr. Lloyd, comes to Gateshead Hall and suggests that Jane go to school.Mr. Brocklehurst is a cold, cruel, self-righteous, and highly hypocritical clergyman who runs a charity school called Lowood. He accepts Jane as a pupil in his school. Jane is infuriated, however, when Mrs. Reed tells him, falsely, that Jane is a liar. After Brocklehurst departs, Jane bluntly tells Mrs. Reed how she hates the Reed family. Mrs. Reed, so shocked that she is scarcely capable of responding, leaves the drawing room in haste.Jane finds life at Lowood to be grim. Miss Maria Temple, the youthful superintendent, is just and kind, but another teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is sour and abusive. Mr. Brocklehurst, visiting the school for an inspection, has Jane placed on a tall stool before the entire assemblage.

Why has the National Lampoon's name been attached to this movie? Even Christmas Vacation was better than this (I actually thought that film was very funny). AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer provides several reasons for this unfavorable sentiment and does not mention any redeeming qualities of the movie. This suggests that they met their viewing experience with a significant amount of dissatisfaction and disappointment. The reviewer states, \\"Why did I waste my time with this movie?\\" This question exhibits frustration and regret, indicating that they feel their time would have been better spent doing something other than watching this movie. This line alone sets a very negative tone for the rest of the review. The next part of the review states, \\"There was not a single funny joke or line throughout.\\" The reviewer is highlighting a key element of the film that they found disappointing. Since many movies, particularly those associated with the National Lampoon's brand, are largely dependent on humor, such a strong rejection of the comedic elements in the film further emphasizes the reviewer's negative sentiment. In the sentence, \\"The slapstick wasn't even mildly funny,\\" the reviewer further emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the humor in the film. They specify that even the slapstick - a common form of physical humor which usually provides at least some comedic relief - failed to amuse them. The phrase, \\"I mean really, an out of control vacuum sucking pipe?\\" comes across as sarcastic and disillusioned. The reviewer is mocking a specific scene, suggesting that they viewed it as a poor attempt at humor and a fail on the part of the filmmakers. They question the association of the movie with the National Lampoon's brand, insinuating that this film does not live up to the expectations set by other films under the same banner. By stating that even \\"Christmas Vacation,\\" — which they thought was a very funny film — was better, they further establish a comparison standard that this movie failed to meet. The verdict, \\"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!\\" further solidifies and underlines the negative sentiment. This strong phrase indicates an extremely aversive reaction to the film, warning potential viewers to stay well away from it. Overall, the sentiment analysis of this review indicates a high degree of dissatisfaction and negativity towards the movie. The reviewer does not mention any positive aspects, expressing only disappointment, disillusion, and advising others to avoid the film entirely.

Information: - Jazz fusion (also known as jazz-rock) is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and Latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice. - Wazoo is a live album by Frank Zappa , posthumously released on October 30 , 2007 . It is a 2 - CD set consisting of the complete concert given by \`\` The Mothers of Invention / Hot Rats / Grand Wazoo '' 20 - piece big band on September 24 , 1972 at the Music Hall , Boston , Massachusetts , United States . It is the last concert of a brief series of shows that marked Zappa 's return to the stage after his forced temporary retirement from the touring scene due to the injuries he suffered from an assault during a concert at the Rainbow Theater in London on December 10 , 1971 . The material showcases Zappa 's endeavors into jazz - based music , and many of the compositions were featured on the 1972 studio albums The Grand Wazoo and Waka / Jawaka and on the 1978 studio album Studio Tan . Rehearsals leading to these albums and concerts are documented on Joe 's Domage ( 2004 ) , while Imaginary Diseases ( 2006 ) presents live recordings with a stripped - down version of the big band named \`\` Petite Wazoo . '' Wazoo is the third installment on the Vaulternative Records label that is dedicated to the posthumous release of complete Zappa concerts , following the releases of FZ : OZ ( 2002 ) and Buffalo ( 2007 ) . This is Official Release # 82 . - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, songwriter, producer, guitarist, actor, and filmmaker whose work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and \\"musique concrète\\" works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his generation. - The Mothers of Invention were an American rock band from California that served as the backing musicians for Frank Zappa. Their work is marked by the use of sonic experimentation, innovative album art, and elaborate live shows. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Musique concrète (meaning \\"concrete music\\") is a form of musique expérimentale (experimental music) that exploits acousmatic listening, meaning sound identities can often be intentionally obscured or appear unconnected to their source cause. It can feature sounds derived from recordings of musical instruments, the human voice, and the natural environment as well as those created using synthesizers and computer-based digital signal processing. Compositions in this idiom are not restricted to the normal musical rules of melody, harmony, rhythm, metre, and so on. Originally contrasted with \\"pure\\" \\"elektronische Musik\\" (based solely on the production and manipulation of electronically produced sounds rather than recorded sounds), the theoretical basis of \\"musique concrète\\" as a compositional practice was developed by Pierre Schaeffer, beginning in the early 1940s. From the late 1960s onward, and particularity in France, the term acousmatic music (musique acousmatique) started to used in reference to fixed media compositions that utilized both musique concrète based techniques and live sound spatialisation.

Step 2: Determine the sequence - Sentence 2 explains Deacon's fear of heights and the destination (Grand Canyon), so it comes next. - Sentence 5 describes Deacon's reaction upon arriving at the destination, so it follows sentence 2. - Sentence 1 talks about Deacon's decision to face his fear and see the sight, so it comes after sentence 5. - Sentence 3 gives the conclusion of the story, mentioning how the experience changed Deacon's life, so it comes last. The sequence for the story would be: 4 (Deacon's family trip), 2 (fear and destination), 5 (arrival and amazement), 1 (Deacon faces fear), and 3 (life-changing experience).

King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians. Merlin is a legendary figure best known as an enchanter or wizard in Arthurian legend. His character's role has been portrayed in various texts, including Geoffrey of Monmouth's \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\" (History of the Kings of Britain) written in 1136. Step 2: Evaluate the role of Merlin in Arthurian legend. Merlin has been portrayed as a counselor, prophet, magician, and an advisor to King Arthur and other rulers in various works of literature and historical accounts. His magical powers, wisdom, and ability to foretell the future made him an invaluable and trusted figure in the court. Step 3: Identify Merlin's position in King Arthur's court. Based on the literature and the nature of Merlin's role, he held the position of a trusted advisor, counselor, and wizard to King Arthur. He provided guidance, wisdom, and occasionally magical assistance to help King Arthur make informed decisions and maintain his rule.

Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between temporalis and the implication. Avicenna's work was further developed by Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī and became the dominant system of Islamic logic until modern times. Avicennian logic also influenced several early European logicians such as Albertus Magnus and William of Ockham. Avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by Aristotle, that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used.

Which entity is this text about? Gautam Gambhir ( pronunciation ; born 14 October 1981) is an Indian cricketer, who played all formats of the game. He is a left-handed opening batsman who plays domestic cricket for Delhi, and captained Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Bangladesh in 2003, and played his first Test the following year against Australia. He captained the Indian team in six ODIs from late-2010 to late-2011 with India winning all six matches. Gambhir scored two successive double-hundreds in 2002 (one of them against the visiting Zimbabweans) made him a strong contender for India's opening slot in all three forms of the game. He made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in the TVS Cup in 2003. In his third match, he scored 71 and was named Man of the Match. His maiden century (103 off 97 balls) came against Sri Lanka in 2005. In 2004, he made his Test debut against Australia in the fourth and last Test match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy but did himself no favours by getting out for 3 and 1. He made amends in his second Test, however, scoring 96 against the South Africans. His maiden Test century came against Bangladesh in December 2004. Gambhir then made a number of starts in the home series against Pakistan in 2005, but was able to make only one half-century in six innings. He made 97 in Zimbabwe later that year, but failed to reach 30 against Sri Lanka at home, repeatedly struggling against Chaminda Vaas, and was subsequently dropped from the Test team. He was replaced in Tests by Wasim Jaffer, who made a double hundred and a hundred in seven Tests. While Gambhir was out of the Test team, he played a number of One Day Internationals for India between 2005 and 2007. However, he was not selected for the 2007 World Cup as the selectors opted for a top-order of Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, and Sachin Tendulkar. It affected him badly and Gambhir later said that \\"When I got dropped for the World Cup, there were times I didn't want to play anymore. I didn't want to practise. I couldn't motivate myself.\\" With no other career options, Gambhir stuck with cricket. After India's first-round exit from the tournament, Gambhir was selected for the One Day International on India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh. Believing the series could be his last chance, Gambhir scored his second century on that tour and was subsequently selected for the One Day International on India's tour to Ireland in 2007. He scored an unbeaten 80 against Ireland in the first game of that tour and was awarded the man of the match award for that effort. In the post-match interview, he indicated that performing more consistently was a top priority for his career as he had done so in the past. Gambhir was selected in India's squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, which India went on to win in South Africa, beating Pakistan in the final. Gambhir performed well in the shortest form of the game, ending the tournament as India's top run scorer, with 227 at an average of 37.83, including three half-centuries which included a crucial 75 runs off 54 balls against Pakistan in the final.

Arnie and his best friend Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) are going to their school, as usual. Arnie is clumsy, and his black-rimmed glasses characterize him as being nerdy. Dennis is a football player, who still befriends Arnie and tries to stand up for him.During shop class, Arnie is bullied by several students led by Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander). Dennis tries to stop the bullies, but he can't be all the time checking on weak Arnie. Today, Buddy stamps on Arnie's sack-lunch and also breaks his glasses. When both Arnie and Dennis tell the shop teacher that Buddy had a switchblade in his possession when he teased Arnie, it looks that the only consequence will be bad for Arnie, as Boddy announces he will take his own back pretty soon.Arnie and Dennis start their way back to their homes.

Answer the following question: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next. Which person will not have convex lenses in their glasses? Answer:","completion":"Jacob will not have convex lenses in his glasses. Kathy is farsighted, which means she has difficulty focusing on nearby objects but can see distant objects clearly. This condition is also known as hyperopia. Convex lenses are used to correct farsightedness by bending the light that enters the eye in such a way that it focuses correctly on the retina. On the other hand, Jacob is nearsighted, which means he can see nearby objects clearly but has difficulty focusing on distant objects. This condition is also known as myopia. Concave lenses are used to correct nearsightedness by diverging the light before it enters the eye, helping it to focus appropriately on the retina. In summary, Kathy will have convex lenses in her glasses to correct her farsightedness, while Jacob will have concave lenses to correct his nearsightedness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal.

Title: Fargo Movie plot: In the winter of 1987, Minneapolis car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) is desperate for money; repayment is due on a large GMAC loan that he fraudulently collateralized with nonexistent dealership vehicles. Dealership mechanic Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis), an ex-convict, refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell). He gives the men a new car from his dealership's lot, and promises to split the 80,000 ransom with them. Back in Minneapolis, Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal; when Gustafson agrees to front the money, Jerry attempts to call off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. Then, he learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself, leaving Jerry a paltry finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean in Minneapolis as planned. While transporting her to their remote cabin hideout, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd, Minnesota for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates. After Carl tries and fails to bribe the trooper, Gaear kills him. When two passing eyewitnesses spot Carl disposing of the body, Gaear kills them as well.

Given the question: Given the following context: The story is set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars, during which Persian armies sweep through the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs Miltiades to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by the traitor Theocrites, is heading for the Piraeus to take Athens.

Here is a news article: Mr. Vidal loved conspiracy theories of all sorts, especially the ones he imagined himself at the center of, and he was a famous feuder; he engaged in celebrated on-screen wrangles with Mailer, Capote and William F. Buckley Jr. Mr. Vidal did not lightly suffer fools — a category that for him comprised a vast swath of humanity, elected officials particularly — and he was not a sentimentalist or a romantic. “Love is not my bag,” he said. By the time he was 25, he had already had more than 1,000 sexual encounters with both men and women, he boasted in his memoir “Palimpsest.” Mr. Vidal tended toward what he called “same-sex sex,” but frequently declared that human beings were inherently bisexual, and that labels like gay (a term he disliked) or straight were arbitrary and unhelpful. For 53 years, he had a live-in companion, Howard Austen, a former advertising executive, but the secret of their relationship, he often said, was that they did not sleep together. Mr. Vidal sometimes claimed to be a populist — in theory, anyway — but he was not convincing as one. Both by temperament and by birth he was an aristocrat. A Child on the Senate Floor Eugene Luther Gore Vidal Jr. was born on Oct. 3, 1925, at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where his father, Eugene, had been an All-American football player and a track star and had returned as a flying instructor and assistant football coach. An aviation pioneer, Eugene Vidal Sr. went on to found three airlines, including one that became T.W.A. He was director of the Bureau of Air Commerce under President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Mr. Vidal’s mother, Nina, was an actress and socialite and the daughter of Thomas Pryor Gore, a Democratic senator from Oklahoma . Mr. Vidal, who once said he had grown up in “the House of Atreus,” detested his mother, whom he frequently described as a bullying, self-pitying alcoholic. She and Mr. Vidal’s father divorced in 1935, and she married Hugh D. Auchincloss, the stepfather of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis — a connection that Mr. Vidal never tired of bringing up. After her remarriage, Mr. Vidal lived with his mother at Merrywood, the Auchincloss family estate in Virginia , but his fondest memories were of the years the family spent at his maternal grandfather’s sprawling home in the Rock Creek Park neighborhood of Washington. He loved to read to his grandfather, who was blind, and sometimes accompanied him onto the Senate floor. Mr. Vidal’s lifelong interest in politics began to stir back then, and from his grandfather, an America Firster, he probably also inherited his unwavering isolationist beliefs. Mr. Vidal attended St. Albans School in Washington, where he lopped off his Christian names and became simply Gore Vidal, which he considered more literary-sounding. Though he shunned sports himself, he formed an intense romantic and sexual friendship — the most important of his life, he later said — with Jimmie Trimble, one of the school’s best athletes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trimble was his “ideal brother,” his “other half,” Mr. Vidal said, the only person with whom he ever felt wholeness. Jimmie’s premature death at Iwo Jima in World War II at once sealed off their relationship in a glow of A. E. Housman-like early perfection, and seemingly made it impossible for Mr. Vidal ever to feel the same way about anyone else. After leaving St. Albans in 1939, Mr. Vidal spent a year at the Los Alamos Ranch School in New Mexico before enrolling at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire . He contributed stories and poems to the Exeter literary magazine, but he was an indifferent student who excelled mostly at debating. A classmate, the writer John Knowles, later used him as the model for Brinker Hadley, the know-it-all conspiracy theorist in “A Separate Peace,” his Exeter-based novel. Mr. Vidal graduated from Exeter at 17 — only by cheating on virtually every math exam, he later admitted — and enlisted in the Army, becoming first mate on a freight supply ship in the Aleutian Islands. He began work on “Williwaw,” a novel set on a troopship and published in 1946, while he was an associate editor at the publishing company E. P. Dutton, a job he soon gave up. Written in a pared-down, Hemingway-like style, “Williwaw” (the title is a meteorological term for a sudden wind out of the mountains) won some admiring reviews but gave little clue to the kind of writer Mr. Vidal would become. Neither did his second book, “In a Yellow Wood” (1947), about a brokerage clerk and his wartime Italian mistress. Mr. Vidal later said it was so bad, he couldn’t bear to reread it. He nevertheless became a glamorous young literary figure, pursued by Anaïs Nin and courted by Christopher Isherwood and Tennessee Williams . In 1948 Mr. Vidal published “ The City and the Pillar,” which was dedicated to J. T. (Jimmie Trimble). It is what would now be called a coming-out story, about a handsome, athletic young Virginia man who gradually discovers that he is homosexual. By today’s standards it is tame and discreet, but at the time it caused a scandal and was denounced as corrupt and pornographic. Mr. Vidal later claimed that the literary and critical establishment, The New York Times especially, had blacklisted him because of the book, and he may have been right. He had such trouble getting subsequent novels reviewed that he turned to writing mysteries under the pseudonym Edgar Box and then, for a time, gave up novel-writing altogether. To make a living he concentrated on writing for television, then for the stage and the movies. Politics Onstage, and for Real Work was plentiful. He wrote for most of the shows that presented hourlong original dramas in the 1950s, including “Studio One,” “Philco Television Playhouse” and “Goodyear Playhouse.” He became so adept, he could knock off an adaptation in a weekend and an original play in a week or two. He turned “Visit to a Small Planet,” his 1955 television drama about an alien who comes to earth to study the art of war, into a Broadway play. His most successful play was “The Best Man,” about two contenders for the presidential nomination. It ran for 520 performances on Broadway before it, too, became a well-received film, in 1964, with a cast headed by Henry Fonda and a screenplay by Mr. Vidal. It was revived on Broadway in 2000 and is now being revived there again as “Gore Vidal’s The Best Man.” Photo Mr. Vidal’s reputation as a script doctor was such that in 1956 MGM hired him as a contract writer; among other projects he helped rewrite the screenplay of “Ben-Hur,” though he was denied an official credit . He also wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation of his friend Tennessee Williams’s play “Suddenly, Last Summer.” By the end of the ’50s, though, Mr. Vidal, at last financially secure, had wearied of Hollywood and turned to politics. He had purchased Edgewater, a Greek Revival mansion in Dutchess County , N.Y., and it became his headquarters for his 1960 run for Congress. He was encouraged by Eleanor Roosevelt , a neighbor who had become a friend and adviser. The 29th Congressional District was a Republican stronghold, and though Mr. Vidal, running as Eugene Gore on a platform that included taxing the wealthy, lost, he received more votes in running for the seat than any Democrat in 50 years. And he never tired of pointing out he did better in the district than the Democratic presidential candidate that year, John F. Kennedy .

Mr. Vidal also returned to writing novels in the ’60s and published three books in fairly quick succession: “Julian” (1964), “Washington, D.C.” (1967) and “Myra Breckinridge” (1968). “Julian,” which some critics still consider Mr. Vidal’s best, was a painstakingly researched historical novel about the fourth-century Roman emperor who tried to convert Christians back to paganism. (Mr. Vidal himself never had much use for religion, Christianity especially, which he once called “intrinsically funny.”) “Washington, D.C.” was a political novel set in the 1940s. “Myra Breckinridge,” Mr. Vidal’s own favorite among his books, was a campy black comedy about a male homosexual who has sexual reassignment surgery. (A 1970 film version, with Raquel Welch and Mae West , proved to be a disaster.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story Perhaps without intending it, Mr. Vidal had set a pattern. In the years to come he found his greatest successes with historical novels, notably what became known as his American Chronicles: “Washington, D.C.,” “Burr” (1973), “1876” (1976), “Lincoln” (1984), “Empire” (1987), “Hollywood” (1990) and “The Golden Age” (2000). He turned out to have a gift for this kind of writing. These novels were learned and scrupulously based on fact, but also witty and contemporary-feeling, full of gossip and shrewd asides. Harold Bloom wrote that Mr. Vidal’s imagination of American politics “is so powerful as to compel awe.” Writing in The Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said, “Mr. Vidal gives us an interpretation of our early history that says in effect that all the old verities were never much to begin with.” But Mr. Vidal also persisted in writing books like “Myron” (1974), a sequel to “Myra,” and “Live From Golgotha: The Gospel According to Gore Vidal” (1992), which were clearly meant as provocations. “Live From Golgotha,” for example, rewrites the Gospels, with Saint Paul as a huckster and pederast and Jesus a buffoon. John Rechy said of it in The Los Angeles Times Book Review, “If God exists and Jesus is his son, then Gore Vidal is going to hell.” In the opinion of many critics, though, Mr. Vidal’s ultimate reputation is apt to rest less on his novels than on his essays, many of them written for The New York Review of Books. His collection “The Second American Revolution” won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1982. About a later collection, “ United States : Essays 1952-1992,” R. W. B. Lewis wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Vidal the essayist was “so good that we cannot do without him,” adding, “He is a treasure of state.” Mr. Vidal’s essays were literary, resurrecting the works of forgotten writers like Dawn Powell and William Dean Howells, and also political, taking on issues like sexuality and cultural mores. The form suited him ideally: he could be learned, funny, stylish, show-offy and incisive all at once. Even Jason Epstein, Mr. Vidal’s longtime editor at Random House , once admitted that he preferred the essays to the novels, calling Mr. Vidal “an American version of Montaigne.” “I always thought about Gore that he was not really a novelist,” Mr. Epstein wrote, “that he had too much ego to be a writer of fiction because he couldn’t subordinate himself to other people the way you have to as a novelist.” Vidal vs. Buckley (and Mailer) Success did not mellow Mr. Vidal. In 1968, while covering the Democratic National Convention on television, he called William F. Buckley a “crypto-Nazi.” Buckley responded by calling Mr. Vidal a “queer,” and the two were in court for years. In a 1971 essay he compared Norman Mailer to Charles Manson , and a few months later Mailer head-butted him in the green room while the two were waiting to appear on the Dick Cavett show. They then took their quarrel on the air in a memorable exchange that ended with Mr. Cavett’s telling Mailer to take a piece of paper on the table in front of them and “fold it five ways and put it where the moon don’t shine.” In 1975 he sued Truman Capote for libel after Capote wrote that Mr. Vidal had been thrown out of the Kennedy White House. Mr. Vidal won a grudging apology. Some of his political positions were similarly quarrelsome and provocative. Mr. Vidal was an outspoken critic of Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians , and once called Norman Podhoretz , the editor of Commentary, and his wife, the journalist Midge Decter, “Israeli fifth columnists.” In the 1990s he wrote sympathetically about Timothy McVeigh , who was executed for the Oklahoma City bombing. And after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he wrote an essay for Vanity Fair arguing that America had brought the attacks upon itself by maintaining imperialist foreign policies. In another essay, for The Independent, he compared the attacks to the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor, arguing that both Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush knew of them in advance and exploited them to advance their agendas. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for literature, it was more or less over, he declared more than once, and he had reached a point where he no longer much cared. He became a sort of connoisseur of decline, in fact. America is “rotting away at a funereal pace,” he told The Times of London in 2009. “We’ll have a military dictatorship pretty soon, on the basis that nobody else can hold everything together.” In 2003 Mr. Vidal and his companion, Mr. Austen, who was ill, left their cliffside Italian villa La Rondinaia (the Swallow’s Nest) on the Gulf of Salerno and moved to the Hollywood Hills to be closer to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Mr. Austen died that year, and in “Point to Point Navigation,” his second volume of memoirs, Mr. Vidal recalled that Mr. Austen asked from his deathbed, “Didn’t it go by awfully fast?” “Of course it had,” Mr. Vidal wrote. “We had been too happy and the gods cannot bear the happiness of mortals.” Mr. Austen was buried in Washington in a plot Mr. Vidal had purchased in Rock Creek Cemetery. The gravestone was already inscribed with their names side by side. Besides his nephew, Burr Steers, Mr. Vidal’s survivors include his sister, Nina Gore Auchincloss Straight. After Mr. Austen’s death, Mr. Vidal lived alone in declining health himself. He was increasingly troubled by a knee injury he suffered in the war, and used a wheelchair to get around. In November 2009 he made a rare public appearance to attend the National Book Awards in New York, where he was given a lifetime achievement award. He had evidently not prepared any remarks, and instead delivered a meandering impromptu speech that was sometimes funny and sometimes a little hard to follow. At one point he even seemed to speak fondly of Buckley, his old nemesis. It sounded like a summing up. “Such fun, such fun,” he said. ||||| Celebrated American author, playwright, politician and commentator Gore Vidal has died, aged 86, at his home in the Hollywood Hills. Gore Vidal wrote 25 novels, including the bestselling Burr and Myra Breckenridge, more than 200 essays and several plays. He also ran for political office twice and was a well-known commentator. Held in high regard for his independent thoughts, Vidal was better known for opposing wars including Vietnam and Iraq, and mocking of religion and prudery. On word of his death this morning, Channel 4 news reporter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said: \\"I imagine Gore Vidal will get to heaven and find it terribly bland. I hope he somehow sends us back a review.\\" Comedian Ricky Gervais tweeted one of Vidal's many famous quotes: \\" ... to rid one's self of this consciousness ... nothing wrong with that..\\" Gore Vidal RIP. \\"The writer Gore Vidal was thoughtful, ideologically consistent, extremely committed and an American isolationist,\\" said Australia's Foreign Minister Bob Carr. Actress Joan Collins paid tribute, saying, \\"So sad my friend the brilliant Gore Vidal has died, he was a total original & genius.\\" Actor James Urbaniak tweeted: \\"Aw, Gore Vidal. RIP. Who will carry on the mid-Atlantic accent? It's up to me and Kelsey Grammer now.\\" Exiled writer Taslima Nasreen paid tributes, quoting Vidal, \\"Democracy is supposed to give you the feeling of choice, like Painkiller X and Painkiller Y. But they're both just aspirin.\\" Congratulating Vidal in 2009 at the National Book Awards ceremony, writer, editor and publisher Dave Eggers said: \\"He meant everything to me when I was learning how to write and learning how to read.\\" \\"His words, his intellect, his activism, his ability and willingness to always speak up and hold his government accountable, especially has been so inspiring to me I can't articulate it.\\" Scissor Sister Jake Shears tweeted, “’Camp is nothing but another word for someone who hasn’t got any talent.’ RIP Gore Vidal. A truly great American original. What a legacy.” Courtney Love paid tribute, “Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say and not giving a damn.’ Quoted by Gore Vidal… you will be missed, rest in peace Gore.” Michael Moore tweeted one of Vidal’s famous quotations, “Half of the American people have never read a newspaper. Half never voted for President. One hopes it is the same half.\\" British actor Nicholas Pegg shared a personal favourite, \\"Norman Mailer punched Gore Vidal at a party after a bad review. Still on the floor, Vidal declared: 'Once again, words fail Norman Mailer.'\\" David Niose, president of the American Humanist Association, spoke of Vidal’s contribution as honorary president: “The progressive and humanist values Gore Vidal repeatedly espoused moved the culture in a positive direction…He spent his life pointing out the places in society that needed the most attention without worrying who might be embarrassed or upset by his opinions.” American actor and writer Frank Conniff tweeted, “Gore Vidal dreaded the idea of an afterlife, because it would mean he'd have to see Norman Mailer again. Rest In Peace.” ||||| Gore Vidal, a celebrated writer, cul­tural gadfly and occasional political candidate, died July 31 at his home in Hollywood Hills, Calif., at 86. He had complications from pneumonia, his nephew, the actor, director and screenwriter Burr Steers, told the Associated Press. Known for his urbanity and wit — “Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little”; “A narcissist is someone better looking than you are” — Mr. Vidal enjoyed a literary career that spanned more than 60 years, and he once said that he hoped to be remembered as “the person who wrote the best sentences of his time.” Mr. Vidal was an astonishingly versatile man of letters and nearly the last major writer of the modern era to have served in World War II. Having resolved at age 20 to live by his pen, he wrote plays for television and Broadway, including the classic political drama “The Best Man”; helped script such movies as “Ben-Hur,” the 1959 epic starring Charlton Heston; and gained notoriety for the campy 1968 novel “Myra Breckinridge,” about a transsexual film enthusiast. Mr. Vidal also won plaudits from scholars, critics and ordinary readers for historical novels such as the best-selling “Julian” (1964), “Burr” (1973) and “Lincoln” (1984). “United States,” which gathers Mr. Vidal’s essays on art, politics and himself, received the 1993 National Book Award. In print or on television — he was a frequent talk-show guest — the worldly Mr. Vidal provoked controversy with his laissez-faire attitude toward every sort of sexuality, his well-reasoned disgust with what he called American imperialism and his sophisticated cynicism about love, religion, patriotism and other sacred cows. He took an acerbic view of American leadership. “Today’s public figures can no longer write their own speeches or books,” he once quipped, “and there is some evidence they cannot read them either.” As a boy, a thirst for learning Mr. Vidal was born Oct. 3, 1925, at West Point, N.Y., where his father, Eugene Vidal, was teaching aeronautics at the military academy. His mother, Nina, was the socialite daughter of Sen. T.P. Gore of Oklahoma. Christened Eugene Luther Gore Vidal, the future writer later lopped off the first two names “for political as well as for aesthetic reasons.” Young Gore spent much of his childhood in Washington and was particularly attached to his grandfather. The senator was blind, so the boy passed many hours reading to him aloud, thus inaugurating his own lifelong passion for learning and books. “The first grown-up book that I read on my own was a nineteenth-century edition of ‘Tales from Livy’ that I’d found in my grandfather’s library,” he once wrote. By 14, he added, “I wanted to know the entire history of the entire world.” Mr. Vidal attended the private St. Albans School in Washington, where he fell in love with a fellow student named Jimmie Trimble, who was killed in combat on Iwo Jima during World War II. In his memoirs “Palimpsest” (1995) and “Point to Point Navigation” (2006), Mr. Vidal makes clear that this youthful passion marked his entire life: He never truly loved anyone again, although he would enjoy hundreds of sexual encounters, many of them with anonymous strangers, in which he took pleasure but, as he repeatedly insisted, never gave any except inadvertently. Although Mr. Vidal maintained a more than 50-year partnership with his companion, Howard Austen, he constantly underscored that the secret of its longevity was “no sex.” Austen died in 2003. As a teenager, Mr. Vidal was sent to boarding school at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, from which he graduated in 1943. Rather than go on to Harvard, he enlisted in the Army, serving as first mate on a small supply ship in the Aleutians. That experience inspired his widely praised first novel, “Williwaw,” which appeared in 1946, when the author was 20. Influence on stage and screen After his discharge, Mr. Vidal decided to bag college and live in New York as a full-time writer. Before long, he became an intimate confidant of diarist Anais Nin and a friend of playwright Tennessee Williams. He also brought out two more novels, including “The City and the Pillar” (1948), an account of two all-American boys and what was — at that time — “the love that dare not speak its name.” Although that book is now viewed as a pioneering work of gay literature, its casual acceptance of homosexual impulses offended some contemporary critics — and Mr. Vidal’s subsequent seven novels went unnoticed by Time magazine, Newsweek and the New York Times. Because most of his fiction of the 1950s — even now admired works such as “Messiah” (1954), the study of a religious cult — proved commercially lackluster, Mr. Vidal decided to earn his living by writing TV dramas, Broadway plays and movie scripts. He also cranked out three mysteries under the pen name Edgar Box. With the money from his commercial writing, Mr. Vidal paid the mortgage on a grandly pillared Greek Revival manse called Edgewater, located on the banks of the Hudson River near Rhinecliff, N.Y. There, he threw parties attended by rising literary notables such as Saul Bellow and Norman Mailer, critics Lionel and Diana Trilling, and movie stars Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman (who became his close friends). Although Mr. Vidal enjoyed a varied social and sexual life, he nonetheless worked hard. On Broadway he hit pay dirt with “Visit to a Small Planet” (1957), in which an alien named Kreton lands on Earth and announces that human beings are his hobby. It deftly skewers contemporary mores and Cold War anxieties. The even more highly regarded political drama “The Best Man” (1960), which was nominated for a Tony Award as best play, presented a behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and dealing between two men competing for the Democratic presidential nomination. Both plays became films and have periodically been revived on stage. As a screenwriter in the 1950s and occasionally afterward, Mr. Vidal contributed to many films, often without screen credit. He wrote a teleplay that inspired “The Left-Handed Gun”(with Newman as Billy the Kid); he was called in to doctor “Ben-Hur”(and tweaked the script to suggest a homosexual subtext to explain the relationship between the epic’s hero and his enemy Messala); and he worked with Williams on the hothouse melodrama “Suddenly, Last Summer.” In his later years, Mr. Vidal appeared with some frequency in films, notably as himself in Federico Fellini’s “Roma” (1972) and as a U.S. senator in Tim Robbins’s “Bob Roberts” (1992). By the early 1960s, the not-yet-40-year-old Mr. Vidal had achieved his goal of financial independence. For the next three decades, he spent much of his life in Italy, his villa a lodestone for literati and glitterati. There he carefully researched his novel “Julian” — about the apostate Roman emperor — and its success relaunched his moribund career as a fiction writer. In general, the older Mr. Vidal published three kinds of fiction: historical novels set in the ancient world, such as “Julian” and 1981’s “Creation” (which features Socrates, Zoroaster, the Buddha and Confucius); campy fantasies that mock American prejudices and conventionalities, the most famous of which is “Myra Breckinridge”; and the so-called American Chronicle, a series of seven novels — the best known are “Burr” and “Lincoln” — detailing the secret political history of the United States. In these years, Mr. Vidal also grew more prominent as a pundit, on TV and in the pages of the New York Review of Books and other periodicals. Although he had published essays and reviews since the 1950s, Mr. Vidal increasingly cast himself as a modern-day Voltaire, commenting on the nation’s follies with waspish asperity and wit. “There is no human problem which could not be solved if people would simply do as I advise,” he said. He insisted that everyone is really bisexual: “There is no such thing as a homosexual or a heterosexual person. There are only homo- or heterosexual acts. Most people are a mixture of impulses if not practices.” Political elections, he observed, were “held at great cost without issues and with interchangeable candidates.” Most famously, during the heated days of the national conventions of 1968, Mr. Vidal squared off on the issue of freedom of speech with conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr. The pair ended up trading insults: “Crypto-Nazi,” Mr. Vidal said. “You queer,” Buckley shot back. Mr. Vidal collected the best of his discursive prose in “United States” (1993), a mammoth volume of literary essays, political polemics and autobiographical reminiscences for which he received the National Book Award. Although it included a scandalously frank account of the Kennedys entitled “The Holy Family,” Mr. Vidal’s finest pieces were not his attacks but his appreciations. He produced exemplary reappraisals — composed in ballpoint pen on yellow legal pads — of his favorite childhood authors (notably L. Frank Baum, creator of the “Oz” books) and of many once-undervalued figures, such as Dawn Powell, Italo Calvino, William Dean Howells, Thomas Love Peacock and Logan Pearsall Smith. That some of these writers continued to be neglected only supports Mr. Vidal’s frequent lament: The age of the reader is passing, and we are living through its twilight’s last gleaming. The occasional politician Although Mr. Vidal found success as a writer and intellectual, he failed in his attempts to win political office. He twice ran unsuccessfully in elections, campaigning for Congress in 1960 and then for the Senate in 1982. While politics was in his view always corrupt, he also felt it had grown more so since World War II. “I date the end of the old republic and the birth of the empire to the invention, in the late thirties, of air conditioning,” he said. Before air conditioning, “the politicians would abandon Washington in the summer; now they stay around all through the year, making mischief.” In his later years, Mr. Vidal grew less witty and increasingly vehement in his political views, speaking out against American policy after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and denouncing the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Mr. Vidal once pointed out that his literary genealogy included “Petronius, Juvenal, Apuleius — then Shakespeare — then Peacock, Meredith, James, Proust.” Like those cultivated and polished writers, Mr. Vidal cast a cold eye on the society of his time and resolutely upheld the values of urbanity and pleasure against the onslaughts of the barbarian, the puritan and the philistine. “Always a godfather, never a god,” he once remarked at a christening. style@washpost.com Dirda reviews books each Thursday in Style and conducts a book discussion for The Post at wapo.st/reading-room. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Gore Vidal was a very talented and famous American writer.

It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago.

Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities have bolstered their search for a missing U.S. citizen and the government rejects assertions that security forces aren't doing enough to find him, the foreign ministry said Friday. David Michael Hartley has been missing since a reported pirate attack September 30 on a lake bisected by the U.S.-Mexico border. Hartley's wife, Tiffany, told authorities her husband was shot and killed by pirates on Falcon Lake during a sightseeing trip. His body has yet to be found, leading to questions about the accuracy of her statements.

David was shot in the head, and she had to leave him behind in order to escape and get help. Tiffany has been advocating for more action to be taken to find her husband and bring his body home. The Mexican government has emphasized its commitment to the search, stating that they have deployed additional personnel, boats, and helicopters to comb the area surrounding Falcon Lake. Authorities from both the United States and Mexico are working together in this joint effort, sharing intelligence and resources. In response to the incident, local and federal officials on both sides of the border have issued warnings to boaters and tourists to stay vigilant and avoid venturing into the lake's remote areas. This incident has also reignited concerns over the increase in criminal activity around the border region, particularly due to its ties to drug trafficking. Authorities are urging anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of David Michael Hartley or the details of the incident to come forward.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the new building that has helped to transform the surrounding area? is inside the article: Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with services from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.Altrincham Interchange is one of the Metrolink's termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16), and now includes a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury. The service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays, and less frequently at other times. National Rail services link the Altrincham and Navigation Road stations with Chester via Northwich, and with Manchester via Stockport. Altrincham Interchange, next to the railway station, is a hub for local bus routes. Manchester Airport, the largest in the UK outside London, is 5 miles (8 km) to the southeast of the town, and is connected via the Manchester Picadilly – Crewe line. There are plans in the future to create a new link between Manchester Airport and the Mid Cheshire Line, which Altrincham Interchange is a station on.

His force of gravitational attraction increased or decreased? A:","completion":"When considering the force of gravitational attraction, we are referring to the force with which the Earth pulls on an object. This force is often experienced as weight and can be described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where F is the force of gravitational attraction, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects being attracted (in this case, Will and the Earth), and r is the distance between the centers of the two objects. In Will's case, since he weighs less than last year, it means his mass (m1) has decreased. The mass of the Earth (m2) remains virtually constant, and the distance between Will and the center of the Earth (r) does not change significantly. As a result, if we plug these changes into the equation, we find that the force of gravitational attraction (F) will have decreased. To break it down, the equation can be simplified as: F = G * m1 * m2 Since G and m2 are constant, we can see that the force of gravitational attraction (F) is directly proportional to Will's mass (m1). Therefore, when Will's mass decreases, the force of gravitational attraction between him and Earth will also decrease. In conclusion, since Will weighs less than last year, his force of gravitational attraction has decreased. This means he experiences a lower pull towards the Earth, and the scale he used to measure his weight also detected this decrease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn't sort of undercut in some way. The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast. There I think maybe the director could have done better. But, to be honest, the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered. But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra Sahi's wife. She may be given little to do, but she does everything with total conviction. I'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience. So if you are in a habit for settling for Bollywood average, you won't get much out of this movie.

This is also why Frankie takes a conservative approach when training upcoming boxers. Although he's a top notch trainer, he's afraid to take them to the top -- he's afraid of what comes with a loss. Thus, we see a boxer leave Frankie for a more aggressive manager.Maggie is extremely determined to prove Frankie wrong, along with the rest of her family. Scrap continues to give Maggie pointers on how to improve and get better. Frankie is still unwilling to commit to become Maggie's trainer. After much persistence, on her 32nd birthday Maggie gets Frankie to agree to train her.We also see a minor back story of Frankie's estranged relationship with his daughter \\"Kate.\\" We see a few shots of letters Frankie writes to his daughter coming back marked, \\"return to sender\\", which he adds to one of many shoe boxes full of such letters in his closet.

Answer:","completion":"Title Suggestion: \\"Fighting Chance: A Knockout Journey\\" In \\"Fighting Chance: A Knockout Journey,\\" we follow the story of Maggie, a determined 31-year-old waitress who dreams of becoming a successful boxer. Narrated by Morgan Freeman's character, \\"Scrap,\\" the movie takes a deep dive into the world of boxing, relationships, and personal triumph. Clint Eastwood stars as Frankie Dunn, a boxing gym owner known for training promising fighters but never taking them all the way to a title bout. When Maggie, played by Hillary Swank, approaches him to help her pursue her boxing dream, Frankie is initially hesitant due to his conservative approach and belief that Maggie is too old to begin training. Throughout the film, we see both characters face their own personal struggles. Frankie is haunted by his past decisions in the boxing world, his conservative training approach, and his guilt over his daughter Kate. His strained relationship with Kate and his unanswered letters to her add an emotional layer to Frankie's character. Maggie, on the other hand, is determined to succeed in boxing and to find a father figure in Frankie, who drowns in his guilt over his estranged daughter. Moreover, she has to overcome societal expectations and stereotypes about women in boxing and face the resistance of her family. Under the watchful eye and encouragement of Scrap, Maggie slowly proves her worth as a boxer. Acknowledging her talent and resilience, Frankie agrees to train her on her 32nd birthday. Together, they embark on a journey that not only tests their abilities in the ring but also helps them confront their inner demons, fears, and other life challenges. \\"Fighting Chance: A Knockout Journey\\" is a poignant and inspiring story that strikes a balance between action-packed boxing scenes and heart-touching emotional moments. Through their shared pursuit of boxing success, Frankie and Maggie develop a deep bond that heals their respective wounds and pushes them to reach their full potential. This film showcases the importance of persistence, struggle, and personal growth while teaching us the value of second chances in the face of adversity. Capturing the spirit of fighting for one's dreams, \\"Fighting Chance: A Knockout Journey\\" delivers a powerful and captivating message about the resilience of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In Las Vegas , federal agents stormed two clubs - Cheetah 's and Jaguars - along with Galardi Enterprises , an office atop a bar in downtown .","completion":"While the two sentences convey a similar situation, they are not exactly the same in terms of meaning and nuance. Here is a comparison and breakdown of the sentences to highlight the differences: 1. In Las Vegas, agents entered two clubs — Cheetah's and Jaguars — along with Galardi Enterprises, an office atop a bar and pool hall in downtown Las Vegas. 2. In Las Vegas, federal agents stormed two clubs - Cheetah's and Jaguars - along with Galardi Enterprises, an office atop a bar in downtown. There are three notable differences between the sentences: 1. Agents vs. federal agents: In the first sentence, the reference is to \\"agents\\", which is ambiguous and could mean any representatives or employees. In the second sentence, it specifies \\"federal agents,\\" which makes it clear that the agents are from a government agency. This difference in descriptions changes the perception of the events taking place in the sentences. 2. Entered vs. stormed: The first sentence uses the term \\"entered,\\" which generally suggests a more casual or calm way of gaining access to the clubs and the office. In contrast, the second sentence uses the term \\"stormed,\\" which suggests forceful entry or aggressive action on the part of the agents. This difference in action words gives a much stronger and more dramatic tone to the second sentence as compared to the first sentence. 3. Bar and pool hall vs. bar: In the first sentence, the location of Galardi Enterprises is described as an \\"office atop a bar and pool hall,\\" while the second sentence only mentions \\"an office atop a bar.\\" This difference in description leaves out the detail about the pool hall, making the location somewhat less specific in the second sentence than in the first one. In conclusion, while both sentences seem to describe the same situation, they convey slightly different meanings and tones due to the variations in the descriptions of the agents, the manner of entering the locations, and the specific location of the Galardi Enterprises office. The first sentence appears to be more neutral and descriptive, while the second sentence seems to emphasize a more dramatic and forceful action by the federal agents."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Here is an article: Throughout the course of the 20th Century, swimming pools have been associated with a certain lifestyle. The Bright Young Things ‘Bath and Bottle Party’ of June 1928, held at St George’s Swimming Baths in London; Terry O’Neill’s 1977 photograph of Faye Dunaway with Oscar in hand by the pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel; even the opening scene of Jonathan Glazer’s Sexy Beast (2000) in which Ray Winstone plays a retired gangster baking in the sun by the side of his pool – the venue and context may change, but one thing remains constant: swimming pools signify luxury, leisure, and above all, glamour. Symbolically though, there’s no better metaphor for repressed desires and clandestine activities. By their very nature pools suggest duality. There’s the world above, and the world below the waterline; a psychological connection between water and the workings of our subconscious. In a world where dreams are manufactured, water is of paramount importance - Thomas AP van Leeuwen A pool, especially a beautifully designed one – think of Gatsby’s ornate marble beauty or newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst’s Neptune Pool at Hearst Castle – is a status symbol. In Billy Wilder’s 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, the ageing silent movie star Norma Desmond’s pool plays a central role, and not simply because the film opens with the discovery of unsuccessful screenwriter Joe Gillis’s body floating face down in it. Like Desmond herself, it stands for the extravagance and excess of Old Hollywood in the “crazy ’20s” when she was at the height of her career. Nothing sums up Desmond’s descent into oblivion and neglect like the image of the empty, leaf-strewn pool; and then with her revitalisation, the pool is also brought back to life. “Poor dope,” says the narrator at the beginning of the film, “he always wanted a pool. Well, in the end he got himself a pool, only the price turned out to be a little high.” Gillis was eager for fame and fortune – everything the pool represented –but he’s also no different from every middle class Tom, Dick and Harry who wants a pool in his own backyard, an increasingly attainable dream in the United States from the ’50s and ’60s onwards. The swimming pool as a suburban status symbol is loaded with many of the same ideals as the grand pools of the wealthy: prosperity, of course, but also a sense of freedom and escape from the daily grind. In Chris Smith’s India-set film The Pool (2007), a young hotel worker becomes obsessed with the swimming pool in the garden of a middle-class villa. He is determined to use it under invitation only, an ambition completely at odds with his existence. His simple aspiration to swim in the pool symbolises his larger life goals such as education and economic advancement. These, of course, are all objectives fundamental to the American Dream – and the suburban aspiration to own a backyard watering hole is particularly evident in California. Southern California, in particular, has long been synonymous with swimming pools, summed up perhaps in David Hockney’s pool-focused paintings from the ’60s and ’70s, the most famous of which is A Bigger Splash (1967), an image that features no figures, just the foamy aftermath of a dive into the otherwise tranquil water. There’s clearly something highly attractive about the domestication of water as a leisure time luxury in the very middle of what is otherwise an arid wilderness. In The Springboard in the Pond: An Intimate History of the Swimming Pool,Thomas AP van Leeuwen suggests a connection between water and dreams, arguing, “in a world where dreams are manufactured, water is of paramount importance. Thus in Hollywood, a place as dry as the nearby desert, the element appears as a dream living in concrete or plastic containers called private swimming pools.” It’s surely no coincidence then that in Mike Nichols’s The Graduate (1967), the friendly career advice a family friend offers Benjamin Braddock, home from college and spending his days “drifting” aimlessly around his parents’ backyard pool on an inflatable sun lounger, is “plastics”. “I just want to say one word to you. Just one word,” the man begins. “Are you listening? Plastics. There’s a great future in plastics. Think about it.” All the while behind them the surface of the pool in its own “plastic container” glistens and ripples in the darkness – a representation of Benjamin’s disaffection and listlessness. Writing in 1977, Joan Didion admits that “the symbolic content of swimming pools has always been interesting,” but, she continues, “a pool is misapprehended as a trapping of affluence, real or pretended, and of a kind of hedonistic attention to the body. Actually a pool is, for many of us in the West, a symbol not of affluence but of order, of control over the uncontrollable. A pool is water, made available and useful, and is, as such, infinitely soothing to the western eye.” In Frank Perry and Sydney Pollack’s Connecticut-set film The Swimmer (1968), based on John Cheever’s 1964 short story of the same name, Ned Merrill, a middle-aged man, decides to “swim home”, pool by pool across his neighbours’ estates. “He seemed to see, with a cartographer’s eye, that string of swimming pools, that quasi-subterranean stream that curved across the county,” writes Cheever. But what begins as an innocent feat of endurance to prove Merrill’s athleticism actually turns out to be an increasingly troubled swim down a river of forgetfulness. We learn – from the snippets of conversation he engages in with the friends he meets along the way – that Merrill’s had some kind of serious mental breakdown and the idyllic domestic set-up he’s swimming home to no longer exists. Not only does Merrill lack his own pool – a notable absence amongst this veritable excess of backyard oases, and thus a sure sign of his inability to exert order over his life – but with each watery immersion the uncontrollable becomes ever more apparent as the picture of a man in serious mental distress is slowly patched together. In at the deep end If America has the monopoly on images of the private pool, across the pond in Europe the municipal version is more often the focus of swimming-related stories, something that’s a necessity of circumstance more than anything else given the absence of a consistently sunny climate like that of California. In Rose Tremain’s novel The Swimming Pool Season (1985), her central characters are a husband and wife who relocate from the UK to the Dordogne after his outdoor swimming pool business has failed. But again, regardless of the difference in size and number of swimmers, images of the public pool in popular culture function with a similar effect to private pools. Films set in public pools such as Jerzy Skolimowski’s Deep End (1970) and Céline Sciamma’s Water Lilies (2007) play with the voyeuristic opportunities of the setting, revealing the pool to be a steamy hotbed of desire, not to mention the actual site of seduction. Water Lilies is a tale of teenage obsession and burgeoning adolescent desire amongst the members of a provincial synchronised swimming team in a suburb outside of Paris, that equates water and sexuality; while the grimy but elegant London-set old Victorian baths in Deep End is a maze of intrigue, illicit longing and sexual encounters. Ultimately sex and death combine and the pool is also an instrument of murder. This same motif can be found in François Ozon’s Swimming Pool (2003). Sarah Morton, a middle-aged English author suffering from writer’s block seeks solitude and contemplation at her publisher’s idyllic holiday home in rural France. Inspired by the events that subsequently transpire, she writes a story of sex and murder, though whether the action we see play out by the side of the pool is actually happening or merely the creation of Sarah’s imagination, we’re never quite sure. The holiday villa pool lies somewhere in between the private backyard version and the larger municipal variety. The most interesting vacations tend to involve a group of people not necessarily intimately related to one another. And as in Swimming Pool, one of the themes most often associated with holiday pools is sexual availability; just think of either Martin Amis’s The Pregnant Widow (2010), set in a Tuscan castle, complete with pool surrounded by bathing beauties for the protagonistto feast his eyes on; or Deborah Levy’s Swimming Home (2011) in which Joe and Isabel Jacobs’ holiday with their daughter and another couple is interrupted by the appearance of a young woman with her sights set on Joe. It’s rare to find something so immediately recognisable the world over as a prized commodity that stands for both the owner’s economic success and firmly demands some sort of symbolic reading. Swimming pools are uncommon hybrids of meaning, something to think about while you lounge by the side of one – private, municipal, or a holiday rental – this summer.

La Strada (lit. \\"The Road\\") is a 1954 Italian drama film directed by Federico Fellini from his own screenplay co-written with Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano. The film portrays a naive young woman (Giulietta Masina) bought from her mother by a brutish strongman (Anthony Quinn) who takes her with him on the road. Fellini has called La Strada \\"a complete catalogue of my entire mythological world, a dangerous representation of my identity that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever.\\" Fellini secured financing through the producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, who wanted to cast Silvana Mangano (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampano, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been the inspiration for the entire project, so Fellini was determined never to accept an alternative to her. For Zampano, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the right person for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, who was a member of Fellini's social circle and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was eager to take the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume. Ultimately, Fellini drew his three leading players from people associated with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampano, later remembering: \\"I thought he was a little bit crazy, and I told him I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days.\\" Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: \\"I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director was the man who had been chasing me for weeks.\\" Fellini was particularly taken with Basehart, who reminded the director of Charlie Chaplin. Upon being introduced to Basehart by Cortese, Fellini invited the actor to lunch, at which he was offered the role of Il Matto. When asked why by the surprised Basehart, who had never before played the part of a clown, Fellini responded: \\"Because, if you did what you did in Fourteen Hours you can do anything.\\" A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony. Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by I Vitelloni, and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: \\"It was his zest for living, and his humor.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who else did he like?","completion":"In the given passage, it is mentioned that Fellini was particularly taken with Richard Basehart, who reminded the director of Charlie Chaplin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Zipoetes I was a king of Bithynia who ruled from around 326 BCE to 278 BCE. To provide more context on Bithynia's history during and after Alexander's conquests, it is essential to mention Bas, the father of Zipoetes I. Bas was the founder of the Bithynian Kingdom and managed to assert and maintain Bithynia's independence despite the expansionist campaign led by Alexander the Great. Bas ruled Bithynia from around 376 to 326 BCE. In the mentioned statement, the battle between Bas and Calas, one of Alexander's generals, indeed demonstrates the intensity of the situation and the subsequent establishment of Bithynia's independence. However, it does not offer the exact time frame of when Zipoetes I assumed the role of king. After Bas' death in or around 326 BCE, his son, Zipoetes I, took over the throne. Zipoetes I further consolidated Bithynia's position as an independent kingdom by expanding its territories during his reign. His rule lasted until his death in 278 BCE, after which his son Nicomedes I succeeded him as the king of Bithynia. In conclusion, the statement regarding Bas defeating Calas to maintain Bithynia's independence provides essential historical context but does not directly answer the question about when Zipoetes I assumed the role of king. Zipoetes I succeeded his father, Bas, and became the king of Bithynia around 326 BCE."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article with the title: \\"U.S. Weighs Pursuit of Death Penalty for Suspect in Boston Bombing\\"","completion":"Title: U.S. Weighs Pursuit of Death Penalty for Suspect in Boston Bombing Introduction The United States has been grappling with the question of whether to pursue the death penalty for the surviving suspect of the tragic Boston Marathon bombings of 2013. The suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, along with his brother Tamerlan, are held responsible for the attack, which left three people dead and injured hundreds more. While the topic of the death penalty remains heavily debated within American society, the case has raised important questions about whether seeking capital punishment in this instance serves the interests of justice and the nation. Background On April 15, 2013, two pressure cooker bombs were detonated near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, resulting in one of the most brutal acts of terrorism on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks. The explosions claimed the lives of three innocent people, including an 8-year-old boy, and caused injuries to more than 260 others. In the subsequent manhunt, the suspects were identified as brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tamerlan was killed in a police shootout, while Dzhokhar was captured several days later. In January 2014, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was indicted on 30 charges, including the use of weapons of mass destruction resulting in death, and the federal government announced its intention to seek the death penalty. In May 2015, a jury sentenced Tsarnaev to death, but his conviction was overturned on appeal in July 2020. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to review this decision during its upcoming term, thus reigniting the debate on the appropriateness of capital punishment in this case. Arguments in Favor of Pursuing the Death Penalty 1. Deterrence: Proponents of the death penalty argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to would-be criminals and terrorists. The prospect of facing the death penalty may act as a strong incentive for individuals to reconsider undertaking terrorist activities within the United States. Thus, seeking the death penalty for Tsarnaev's crimes might deter future acts of terror. 2. Justice for Victims: Many of those directly affected by the bombings believe that seeking the death penalty is an appropriate way to honor the memory of those who lost their lives in this heinous attack. By imposing the harshest penalty available, the prosecution aims to send a strong message about the severity of the crime committed and the suffering inflicted upon innocent victims. 3. Retribution: The retributive nature of the death penalty is another argument raised in favor of pursuing it. In this view, capital punishment offers a sense of closure and justice to the victims and their families by acknowledging the magnitude of the crime and handing down a punishment that matches the severity of the offense. Arguments Against Pursuing the Death Penalty 1. Risk of Execution Errors: Critics of the death penalty argue that the risk of executing an innocent person is too high. While Tsarnaev's guilt may seem clear-cut in this case, concerns about the accuracy of the U.S. criminal justice system persist. Some argue that it would be more humane to pursue a life sentence instead, avoiding the risk of an irreversible mistake. 2. Cost: The financial cost of seeking the death penalty is considerably higher than that of other sentences. Lengthy legal processes and appeals, often spanning years or even decades, can present a significant burden on taxpayers. Critics maintain that it would be better to allocate these resources towards reform and rehabilitation of convicted criminals or to support the victims and their families. 3. International Relations: Pursuing the death penalty for Tsarnaev, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Chechen origin, may have diplomatic implications for the United States. While capital punishment is a legal option in the U.S., many nations have abolished it, viewing it as a violation of human rights. As such, pursuing the death penalty in high-profile cases could potentially strain international relations and hinder cooperation in counter-terrorism efforts. Conclusion The debate over whether to pursue the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev represents a microcosm of the larger conversation about capital punishment within the United States. Regardless of the outcome, this case underscores the need for a thoughtful and conscientious approach to the application of the death penalty. Ultimately, the decision will have lasting implications for the American justice system, domestic and international counter-terrorism efforts, and the nation's ongoing struggle to reconcile the demands of justice and humanity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Question: what was muhammad's vision? Would \\"In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"To answer this question, it is important to first understand the context of Muhammad's vision. Muhammad, the founder of Islam, had a series of revelations from the angel Gabriel that formed the basis for the Islamic faith. His vision was primarily about spreading the message of Islam, which emphasized the worship of one God, social justice, and moral and spiritual values. Now, to address the statement \\"In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina,\\" it can be considered a reasonable answer in the sense that it represents one aspect of the broader vision of Muhammad. The Constitution of Medina was indeed a significant achievement during the early years of Islam, where he managed to bring different tribes together and establish a unified community that followed the tenets of Islam. However, this specific accomplishment, while important, does not fully capture the entirety of Muhammad's vision. His vision also included the global spread of Islam, promoting moral values, and striving for a just society. So, while the Constitution of Medina is a significant part of Muhammad's vision, it should be expanded upon to provide a more comprehensive understanding of his aspirations for the Islamic faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process, involving the respiratory system and the circulation of oxygen throughout the body, begins with inhalation. Inhalation, also known as inspiration, is the process by which air is drawn into the lungs, allowing the oxygen to pass through the bronchial tubes and subsequently enter the pulmonary system. During inhalation, the diaphragm, a large, dome-shaped muscle located at the base of the lungs, contracts and moves downward. This movement increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, creating a negative pressure within the lungs relative to the atmospheric pressure outside the body. As a result, air rushes into the airways, leading to the expansion of the rib cage. The inhaled air enters the body through the nose and mouth, with the nose being the primary entry for air due to its function in filtering, warming, and humidifying the air. Additionally, the nose contains tiny hairs called cilia and a mucus layer that traps particles such as dust and pollen, preventing them from reaching the lungs. From the nose, the air moves through the nasal cavities and into the pharynx, a funnel-shaped passageway that connects the nasal cavity and mouth to the esophagus and larynx. The air then travels down the larynx, or voice box, and passes through the vocal cords. The larynx acts as a protective barrier to prevent food particles from entering the airways during swallowing. Below the larynx, the air reaches the trachea, or windpipe, a tube composed of rings of cartilage that reinforce its structure and prevent collapse. The trachea then divides into two bronchi, which in turn branch into a system of bronchial tubes that extend into the lungs. As the bronchial tubes branch further, they become smaller and eventually transition into bronchioles. Finally, the oxygen in the inhaled air reaches the alveoli, tiny air sacs surrounded by networks of capillaries. It is within the thin walls of the alveoli that the crucial exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and blood takes place. In conclusion, the first step of the process involves inhalation, during which air containing oxygen is drawn into the body through the nose or mouth and travels through the intricate respiratory system, eventually reaching the alveoli in the lungs. From here, the oxygen can pass into the bloodstream, where it can be transported and utilized by cells throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: suppose there is no residual noise in the area happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: less If there is no residual noise in the area, it means that the surroundings are extremely quiet and calm. Although noise pollution does not directly affect oxygen delivery to the bloodstream, a completely noise-free environment can have indirect effects. In a serene environment, the body's parasympathetic nervous system becomes more active, leading to a decrease in heart rate and a more relaxed state. This state of relaxation can, in turn, lead to slower and shallower breathing. When our breathing rate decreases, the lungs take in a smaller volume of air, reducing the amount of oxygen that enters the alveoli. The alveoli play a crucial role in gas exchange; oxygen from the air diffuses across the alveoli walls into the surrounding blood vessels while carbon dioxide diffuses out from the blood vessels to the alveoli and is expelled when we exhale. When less oxygen is available in the alveoli due to slower and shallower breathing, the blood vessels surrounding them receive a smaller amount of oxygen, and therefore deliver less oxygen to the body's cells. It's important to note that this effect would most likely be subtle, and the body has mechanisms in place to regulate breathing and ensure adequate oxygen delivery even in quiet environments.

Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily.

Select from: [+] not enough information [+] old Italian lady [+] Jody [+] Dara Given those answer options, answer the question: Dara and Jody sat on the sun-scorched concrete with their backs against the bus shelter. They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool.

Article: Patti Page, the top-selling female artist of the 1950s with more than 100 million records sold, died on January 2nd, 2013, when she was 85. She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit . Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series \\"The Patti Page Show\\". She continued to record and perform into the 21st century, most recently releasing an album of songs for children, a Christmas record, and a new \\"best of\\" collection.

It could prove to be a pivotal moment in the Italian Serie A title race -- Juventus escaped with a 1-1 draw at AC Milan on Saturday after Sulley Muntari's first-half goal was controversially disallowed despite clearly crossing the line. With champions and league leaders Milan leading 1-0 at the time, Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon desperately clawed back the Ghana midfielder's header from a corner -- and the referee waved play on to the dismay of the home players and their fans. \\"That incident that certainly falsified the result. Either the line was drawn wrong and was a bit too big,\\" Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters. \\"There is no need to see the replays. It was pretty obvious from all around the stadium.\\" The visitors also had a goal disallowed in the second half as Alessandro Matri was deemed to be offside in a very marginal decision, but the substitute leveled in the 83rd minute with his 10th goal this season to maintain Juve's unbeaten record after 24 matches. Antonio Conte's team were reduced to 10 men five minutes later when Arturo Vidal was sent off for a cynical foul on Mark van Bommel, but held on to stay one point behind Milan with a game in hand. The Rossoneri had taken the lead after 14 minutes when Antonio Nocerino fired in a deflected shot against his former club, whose defender Leonardo Bonucci gave the ball away to Robinho with a careless pass. January loan signing Muntari thought he had added to midfielder Nocerino's eighth league goal this season, but the linesman did not flag for the goal despite replays showing the ball went well over the Juve line before Buffon intervened. Third-placed Udinese and Lazio both trail Juve by eight points, but can cut the deficit on Sunday with victories against Bologna and Fiorentina respectively. In Saturday's other match, mid-table Genoa snatched a 2-2 draw against Parma thanks to two late goals from striker Rodrigo Palacio. The Argentine striker followed up his saved penalty to pull one back in the 78th minute, then took his tally to 14 for this season deep into time added on. Parma led in the sixth minute through defender Massimo Gobbi, then striker Sergio Floccari made it 2-0 eight minutes after the break against his former team. In Spain, Levante moved up into the fourth and last Champions League qualification place after snatching a 2-1 win at European rivals Espanyol in Saturday's late match. Substitute Ruben Suarez smashed in a freekick off the defensive wall in the 89th minute to seal the points after it had looked like the Barcelona-based hosts had earned a draw thanks to a 75th-minute header from Nigeria striker Kala Uche, who came on as a substitute. It was Valencia-based Levante's first win in nine La Liga matches. Malaga had temporaily taken fourth after thrashing bottom club Real Zaragoza 5-1, but ended the day in fifth -- one point above Espanyol. Racing Santander and Sporting Gijon remained in the bottom three after sharing the points in a 1-1 draw, while Real Betis and Getafe had the same result in a mid-table clash.

There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims. A 2003 decree by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area. Biritiba Mirim, a town of 28,000 inhabitants, not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away.

A chicken escapes, and an armed gang chases after it in a favela called the Cidade de Deus (\\"City of God\\"). The chicken stops between the gang and a young man named Rocket (BuscapÃ©), who believes the gang wants to kill him. A flashback traces Rocket, the narrator, back to the late 1960s. In the 1960s, the favela is a newly built housing project far from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, with little access to electricity and water. Three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the \\"Tender Trio\\" â Shaggy, Clipper, and Goose â rob and loot business owners; Goose is Rocket's brother. The thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the City and are protected by them in return. Several younger boys idolize the trio, and one, Li'l Dice (Dadinho), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells Li'l Dice to serve as lookout. They give him a gun and tell him to fire a warning shot if the police arrive, but an unsatisfied Li'l Dice fires a warning shot mid-robbery and guns down the motel inhabitants once the gang have run off. The massacre brings police attention, forcing the trio to split up: Clipper joins the church, Shaggy is shot by the police while trying to escape the favela, and Goose is shot by Li'l Dice after taking the thieving boy's money while Li'l Dice's friend Benny (BenÃ©) watches. Some years later in the 1970s, the favela has transformed into an urban jungle. Rocket has joined a group of young hippies.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress? Context: Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.

Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Horace Leonard \\"H. L.\\" Gold (April 26, 1914 February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\", and also wrote briefly for DC Comics. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - A science fiction magazine is a publication that offers primarily science fiction, either in a hard copy periodical format or on the Internet. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - All About the Future is a 1953 anthology of science fiction short stories edited by Martin Greenberg . The stories originally appeared in the magazines Astounding , Galaxy Science Fiction and the Boston University Graduate Journal . - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Martin Greenberg (28 June 1918-20 October 2013) Is an American book publisher and editor of science fiction anthologies. - Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by an Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made \\"Galaxy\\" the leading science fiction (sf) magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?","completion":"This product review most certainly conveys a negative sentiment. There are various cues present within the text which suggest dissatisfaction and an unfavorable opinion of the subject— in this case, a made-for-TV production. Let's take a closer look at these cues: 1. Title: The title includes the phrase \\"Wow......Did that suck!!!!\\", which signifies a strong reaction of disappointment. The author not only used strong language, but also used multiple exclamation points to emphasize the intensity of the dissatisfaction. 2. Description as \\"made for TV shlock\\": The use of the word \\"shlock\\" refers to something that is worthless, inferior, or has low quality. By describing the production as such, the reviewer is expressing their opinion that it lacked value, and thus reinforces a negative sentiment. 3. Comparison to watching flies procreate: This statement serves as a metaphor that highlights the level of dissatisfaction with the content. Comparing something as undesirable as watching flies procreate signifies the author's way of saying they found the subject utterly unappealing and less-than-mediocre.

The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.

He is a registered Republican who successfully ran with the Republican, Conservative, Independence, and Reform Party endorsements. The district includes portions of Putnam and Westchester counties in the Hudson Valley. Can we draw the following conclusion? Kevin Bryne is part of the 92nd District","completion":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that Kevin Byrne is part of the 92nd District based on the provided information. It’s explicitly stated that Kevin Byrne serves as the Assembly member for the 94th District of the New York State Assembly, which includes portions of Putnam and Westchester counties in the Hudson Valley. We do not have any information to suggest that he has any association with the 92nd District. Any such conclusion would be speculative and unsupported by the facts at hand. To elaborate further, Districts in the New York State Assembly are political boundaries that dictate which constituents an Assembly member represents. Each Assembly member represents one District. Given that, it is highly unusual for an Assembly member to switch Districts. In fact, an Assembly member's District can only change through redistricting, which is a process that typically occurs every ten years after the US census data is updated, or if the Assembly member runs for and is elected to represent a different District. Unless there is clear evidence that any of these circumstances have taken place, the most accurate and reliable course is to assume that Kevin Byrne still represents the 94th District as specified. Switching districts would involve a comprehensive process and would generally be highly publicized, especially when it involves a change from one region to another (like from the 94th to the 92nd district).

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a large earthquake happened recently happens, how will it affect the rocks crack less. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a large earthquake happening recently can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of rock cracking and the development of future earthquakes. Direct effects: 1. The large earthquake may relieve some of the pressure built up within the Earth's crust, causing a temporary decrease in the stress on the rocks surrounding the cracks. This could lead to less cracking and movement in the short term. 2. The energy released during the large earthquake could cause existing cracks to widen or new cracks to form, changing the configuration of the rock formations and potentially reducing the likelihood of another significant earthquake in the near future. Indirect effects: 1. The seismic waves produced by the large earthquake can cause changes in the Earth's crust, such as rearrangements of rock layers or alterations in the properties of the rocks themselves. These changes could influence the overall stability of the crust and potentially reduce the likelihood of another significant earthquake. 2. Large earthquakes can trigger secondary effects, such as landslides and ground subsidence, which may alter the pressure distribution within the Earth's crust and influence the development of future rock cracking and earthquake potential. Overall, a large earthquake happening recently could affect the rocks' cracking processes and the likelihood of future earthquakes by relieving pressure, causing changes in rock configurations, and triggering secondary effects that alter stress distribution within the Earth's crust. However, it is essential to note that these effects may vary depending on the specific location, the magnitude and characteristics of the large earthquake, and the geological context of the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\".

Given the question: Information: - The Pilgrimage ( Portuguese : O Diário de Um Mago , \`\` Diary of a Mage '' ) is a 1987 novel by Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho . It is a recollection of Paulo 's experiences as he made his way across northern Spain on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela . The novel serves as part adventure story , part guide to self - discovery . - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Santiago de Compostela, commonly known as Santiago, is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain. - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Paulo Coelho de Souza (, , ; born August 24, 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist. He is the recipient of numerous international awards, amongst them the Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum. His novel \\"The Alchemist\\" has been translated into 81 languages. According to \\"The Washington Post\\", Paulo Coelho has sold an estimated 350 million books and is the all-time bestselling Portuguese-language author. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.

So the answer is: (I). no"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. They are special. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"Considering the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, \\"They are special,\\" requires analyzing several aspects such as grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Here's a detailed breakdown of each aspect: 1. Grammar: The sentence follows the basic structure of subject-verb-object, in this case: \\"They(subject) - are(verb) - special(object).\\" This structure is grammatically correct because the verb agrees with the subject, and it follows the standard format for English sentences. Therefore, the sentence maintains its grammatical integrity. 2. Syntax: Syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. The syntax in this sentence is simple and straightforward, as it follows the standard order (subject-verb-object) without any complex structures or subordination. It is a simple statement that can be easily understood by any English speaker, maintaining its syntactic integrity. 3. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meaning of individual words and phrases and how they contribute to the overall meaning of the sentence. In this sentence, the individual words have clear and concise meanings: a. \\"They\\" - A plural pronoun referring to more than one person or object. b. \\"are\\" - A form of the verb \\"to be,\\" which denotes existence or identity. c. \\"special\\" - An adjective describing a unique or exceptional quality or characteristic. When combined, these words create a sentence with a clear meaning - that the people or objects being referred to possess unique or exceptional qualities. The semantic integrity of the sentence is preserved. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics evaluates how language is used within a particular context. In this case, the context of the sentence is not given. However, given the simplicity and clarity of the sentence, it can be inferred that the speaker or writer is expressing an opinion or observation about the subject (the people or objects referred to as \\"they\\") being noteworthy or exceptional in some manner. When considering the context, it's crucial to note that the indexicality of the pronoun \\"they\\" might be a source of ambiguity. Without any context, \\"they\\" could refer to any group of individuals or objects, which may pose difficulties in understanding and interpretation. Despite this potential issue, the sentence maintains its pragmatic integrity as long as the context is clear to both speaker/writer and listener/reader. In summary, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"They are special\\" is preserved when closely examining grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The sentence is simple, clear, and easy to understand when given sufficient context, effectively conveying its intended message."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The personal name \\"Sonja\\" doesn't change. - \\"la rubia\\" - In Spanish, \\"la\\" is a feminine definite article that translates to \\"the\\" in English. \\"Rubia\\" means \\"blonde\\" in English, and it's used to describe the female subject, Sonja, in this sentence.

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight.

This provides evidence to the reader that Faerûn is deeply intertwined with \\"D&D\\" content, both in terms of tabletop gameplay resources and in novels and video games inspired by the setting. As there are numerous source books and multimedia content explicitly focusing on Faerûn, it is reasonable to infer that D&D players would be quite familiar with or, at the very least, aware of the Faerûn setting. The text also implies that Faerûn is used quite extensively within the D&D community, as it is referenced in multiple formats and creations that cater to the players of the game. Furthermore, both the \\"D&D\\" community and players are known to be highly engaged in various campaign settings, eagerly exploring and appreciating the diverse, intricate worlds created for playing. This reinforces the assumption that Faerûn is indeed well-known among D&D players. In summary, given the strong connection between the Faerûn subcontinent and \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" in the provided text, combined with the D&D community's interest in campaign settings and the extensive amount of source material available, it is appropriate and coherent to conclude that Faerûn is well-known among D&D players."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine the terms involving 'a' on the right-hand side of the equation: -20*a = -23*a - 107*a + 2310 -20*a = (-23 - 107)*a + 2310 -20*a = -130*a + 2310 2. Now, we want to get all 'a' terms on one side and all constant terms on the other. To do this, we'll add 130*a to both sides of the equation: -20*a + 130*a = -130*a + 130*a + 2310 (130-20)*a = 2310 110*a = 2310 3. Now, in order to isolate 'a', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 110: (110*a) / 110 = 2310 / 110 a = 21 So, the value of 'a' that satisfies the given equation is 21."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Together with his brother Greg, they dedicate time away from their adventure tour company to drape the town is Christmas cheer. When Dan's old high school rival Mitch Bright, a mean-spirited and embittered militant atheist returns home after 20 years, Dan is immediately suspicious.

Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband. I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way. A few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn’t have.

Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another’s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily. I never knew I needed romance because I’d never had it. This is how I need to be loved.

Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating noises now? I heard it again. It was a fine bell, reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I'd seen in documentaries. And accompanying the bell, I saw a light. Now, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense. First, the whole in-a-vacuum why's-there-a-bell thing. Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright. These signals were the heralds of my saviors. The first words they said to me meant nothing. I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing. Next to those, nothing else mattered. The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better. (I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.) When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around. The ship, it was odd and old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew standing around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk.

Now let's solve for x: Step 1: Add 6 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -6. -6x - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6, which is -6x = 6. Step 2: Now let's get rid of the -6 in front of the x by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. (-6x) / (-6) = 6 / (-6). This gives us x = -1.

Various methods have been used in the history of the American colonies and the United States but only five methods are currently used. Historically, burning, crushing, breaking on wheel, and bludgeoning were used for a small number of executions, while hanging was the most common method. The last person burned at the stake was a black slave in South Carolina in August 1825. The last person to be hanged in chains was a murderer named John Marshall in West Virginia on April 4, 1913. Although beheading was a legal method in Utah from 1851 to 1888, it was never used. How many execution methods are currently outlawed in the United States? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"To determine how many execution methods are currently outlawed in the United States, we first need to identify the currently used methods and other historical methods that are no longer in use. 1. Currently used methods: There are five methods currently used in the United States: lethal injection, electrocution, gas chamber, hanging, and firing squad. 2. Historically used methods: Burning, crushing, breaking on the wheel, bludgeoning, and beheading were mentioned as historical methods. Hanging was also a historical method, but it is still in use today. Now, let's compare the historical methods to the current methods: - Burning - not used currently. - Crushing - not used currently. - Breaking on the wheel - not used currently. - Bludgeoning - not used currently. - Beheading - not used currently.

Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is hungry for a hit. He has received a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers near perfection.

He invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from Sidney's plays, to discuss it. Clifford (Reeve) arrives by train. Myra tries desperately over the course of an evening to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners, but to no avail; Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), a minor celebrity who is staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house; before she leaves she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him. As she prepares for bed, Myra is beginning to come to terms with what Sidney has done. All is calm until Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out; she collapses and dies. Sidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and sidles unperturbed to Clifford's side. They exchange a few words about what to do with Myra's body, then exchange a passionate kiss. Clifford moves in with Sidney.

Question: I can use this background: The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered. Tanks do not have a steering wheel. Instead, they have an accelerator to produce forward motion and separate brakes on each tread. The operator uses brakes on both treads at the same time in order to stop, but brakes on only one tread to turn the tank. By braking one side, the operator causes that side to slow down or stop while the other side continues at the previous speed, causing the tank to turn towards the slower tread. Now, I have a new situation: Benjamin is taking an Army training class and is learning to operate a tank. Today, he is in a tank with an instructor on a training course. Benjamin drives the tank forward and comes to a large dirt mound blocking his path. He needs to decide whether to break the left tread or right tread. Answer this question please: If the tread on the right is going faster which direction will the tank turn? Answer:","completion":"If the tread on the right is going faster, and Benjamin chooses to brake the left tread, the tank will turn towards the left.

Gather Your Materials: Start the process by gathering your shoe cleaning materials. You'll at least need a brush (soft bristle for delicate materials, medium or hard bristle for more resistant footwear), a shoe cleaning solution, a towel, and water. If the shoes are very stained, you might also need baking soda or toothpaste. 2. Remove the Laces: To ensure you're able to clean every part of the shoe effectively, it's best to remove the shoelaces. This allows you to clean the tongue of the shoe and the area beneath the laces thoroughly. You can clean the laces separately using soap and water, or replace them if they're old and frayed. 3. Brush off Excess Dirt: Brush the shoes gently to remove any dry, loose dirt. This step helps prevent you from rubbing grit into the shoes as you clean. It's just a surface level cleaning to prepare the shoes for washing. 4. Apply Your Cleaning Solution: Create a cleaning mixture with your shoe cleaning solution and water following the instructions on the product package. If you're using household products, a combination of warm water and a small amount of dish detergent can work as well. Once created, dip your brush into the solution. 5. Begin Scrubbing: Use the brush to gently scrub the surface of the shoes. Start at the soles and work your way up. Pay particular attention to stains and scuffs, you might need to scrub harder at those spots. 6. Wipe and Rinailse: After making sure you've scrubbed the entire surface of your shoes, use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe off the soapy solution. If necessary, rinse the shoes under a gentle stream of cold water. Be sure not to soak them, as this could damage some types of shoes. 7. Dry the Shoes: Pat the shoes dry with a towel to remove excess moisture. Then, leave them in a well-ventilated area to air dry. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or near a heat source, which could distort the shape and cause damage. You can stuff the shoes with newspaper or a dry towel to help them retain their shape as they dry. 8. Replace the Laces: Once the shoes are dry, replace the laces if you've also cleaned and dried them or if you've bought new ones. Justifying each step, the process is laid out in such a manner that it allows you to gather all necessary materials before beginning to prevent interruption. Removing the laces ensures that the entire material of the shoe can be cleaned and not just the visible parts. Brushing off excess dirt ensures that the cleaning solution can work directly on the stains rather than on surface grime. Rinsing and drying properly prevent water marks and damage to the shoes, round off the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His main focus is the long-suspected connections between macabre rituals and unexplained phenomena in the town. The townsfolk are wary of outsiders, but Dr. Harris is determined to uncover their secretive past. One day, while examining artifacts in the dense woods surrounding Willowbrook, Dr. Harris comes across a gruesome sight: Sydney Campbell's severed arm, dangling from a tree. Sydney, a young and curious journalist, had arrived in Willowbrook weeks earlier to investigate the same mysteries. The news of her disappearance had shaken the town, and the police had given up searching when they found no leads. The discovery of her severed arm, however, reopens the case. Dr. Harris teams up with Lila Dawson, the local librarian, who believes that there is more to the town than meets the eye. They delve deeper into Willowbrook's history, discovering a clandestine sect that practices ancient rituals in an attempt to remain in control. The sect's members are willing to go to any lengths to keep their activities secret, including silencing individuals that come too close to uncovering the truth. After a series of tragic incidents, it becomes clear that their followers are deeply entrenched in the community, which forces Dr. Harris and Lila into a dangerous game of deception and intrigue as they risk it all to expose the truth. In a heart-stopping climax, Dr. Harris and Lila enter the hidden lair of the sect, where they find evidence of their involvement in Sydney's murder and the unexplained phenomena in Willowbrook. With the help of local authorities, they manage to dismantle the organization, putting an end to the reign of terror that had gripped the town.

He publishes his findings, bringing closure to Sydney's family and inspiring other researchers to delve into the unexplored parts of human history. \\"The Lurking Shadows\\" is a gripping tale of mystery, ancient rituals, and humanity's thirst for power.

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Robots make me nervous--especially the ones which seem to think for themselves. I was embarrassed to admit this till I heard that Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, felt the same way. Gates said in an interview with the social networking and news website Reddit: \\"I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent.That should be positive if we manage well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern.\\" Well, maybe I don't have to worry about my computer and kitchen equipment yet. After I use them I can always pull the plug. But in the future, machines might find a way to prevent us from switching them off. There's a terrible thought! Maybe the problem with computers too clever for us is not that they are evil like some we've seen in sci-fi movies. What could put us in danger is that they might be too efficient. That's what philosopher Nick Bostrom from Oxford University believes. He says that machines are indifferent to humans and in pursuit of their own goals,the destruction of people might be just additional damage. Bostrom gives us an example: A machine which might have as its only goal to produce as many paperclips as possible might look at human bodies as extra material for paperclips and go after you. Because it is, well, a machine, it would not take pity on you. It's a good thing that American writer Isaac Asimov thought about how far robots can go and left us his three rules of robotics.

Huge sinkhole opens up in Japanese city: 'I heard a loud boom' Read more In a typical demonstration of Japanese workmanship and efficiency, workers toiled around the clocks and had practically filled in the section of road in just two days, according to local media. The road reopened to traffic and pedestrians early on Tuesday after local officials declared the repaired stretch safe. The weeklong rush to reopen the busy stretch of road included repairs to a sewage pipe and replacing traffic lights and utility poles that were swallowed when the sinkhole opened up shortly after 5am local time on 8 November. The incident caused power cuts and disrupted phone signals, and gas and water supplies, but there were no reports of injuries. The biggest city sinkholes around the world – in pictures Read more The mayor of Fukuoka, Soichiro Takashima, said the affected ground was now 30 times stronger than before, adding that a panel of experts would be set up to establish the cause of the cave-in. Local media reports said the 30m by 27m sinkhole, which was 15 metres deep, was caused by construction work on an extension to an underground line. The Fukuoka workers, who filled the hole with 6,200 cubic metres of sand and cement, drew praise on social media. One person tweeted: “I’m surprised the road reopened in a week!” Another said: “Impressive. That was fast.” The astonishing speed of the repair work brought back memories of the efforts to reopen roads that were badly damaged by the March 2011 triple disaster.

Question: what is feedback mechanism in plants during respiration I found the following answer on Google: This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not correctly explain the feedback mechanism in plants during respiration. Let me provide you with a more detailed and comprehensive answer. Respiration is the process by which plants produce energy by breaking down glucose molecules in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide, water, and usable energy (ATP). A feedback mechanism in the context of respiration refers to a regulatory system that monitors and maintains the balance between the processes of respiration and photosynthesis. Plant respiration is tightly regulated by various feedback mechanisms that involve sensors, signaling pathways, and regulatory molecules. The main feedback mechanism during plant respiration is based on concentrations of cellular components and gases like oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Here's an overview of the feedback mechanism that occurs during plant respiration: 1. Oxygen (O2) Concentration: Respiration depends on the availability of oxygen. A decrease in oxygen concentration signals the plant to lower its respiration rate, saving energy and preventing the production of harmful reactive oxygen species. Conversely, increased oxygen concentrations encourage higher respiration rates, supporting active growth and metabolism. 2. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Concentration: Plants monitor the concentration of CO2 in their cells, as it is a key component in photosynthesis and a byproduct of respiration. If the concentration of CO2 increases due to higher-than-normal respiration rates, the plant adjusts its processes to avoid excess CO2 buildup. This may involve altering the balance between photosynthesis and respiration rates or opening stomatal pores to release excess CO2. 3. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) Concentrations: The primary purpose of respiration is to produce ATP, which serves as an energy currency for the plant's cellular processes. Plant cells sense the relative concentration of ATP and ADP molecules. When ATP levels are high, respiration may slow down to conserve energy and resources. Conversely, if ATP levels are low, and ADP levels are high, the plant may increase its respiration rate to generate more ATP for energy-demanding processes. 4. Allosteric Regulation of Enzymes: In addition to sensing the concentration of gases and energy molecules, plants also regulate respiration by modulating the activity of enzymes involved in the process. Key enzymes, like cytochrome c oxidase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, are sensitive to feedback inhibition or activation, allowing the plant to fine-tune its respiration rate according to its needs. For example, high concentrations of ATP may inhibit specific enzymes in the respiratory pathway, thereby slowing down the production of ATP and conserving energy. In summary, the feedback mechanism in plants during respiration is a complex regulatory system that involves monitoring and adjusting the respiration rate based on the concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, and ADP, as well as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. This ensures that plants maintain a balance between respiration and photosynthesis, optimizing growth, and functioning under changing environmental conditions. The answer you found on Google does not accurately describe this intricate feedback process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information: - A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross. - Raymon van der Biezen ( born January 14 , 1987 in Heesch ) is a Dutch BMX racer . Van der Biezen reached the semi final of the 2008 World Championship in Taiyuan , China . He qualified himself for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed. The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old. - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom. - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions. - Freestyle BMX is bicycle motocross stunt riding on BMX bikes. It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland. - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races. 'raymon van der biezen' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'sport'?

Process: - Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day - They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey - They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen - They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark - They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey - The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak - The owl eats the prey, or carries it back to its perch - Question: suppose more heavy exercising happens, how will it affect Owls will become more sickened. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The question seems to be asking about the impact of increased heavy exercise on owls and how it might affect their ability to become sickened as well as the potential impact on their hunting process, specifically the second effect mentioned - sitting still on a perch and waiting for prey. First, it's essential to understand that owls are wild animals with specific hunting and survival strategies. They naturally engage in a level of physical activity best suited to their survival. If the situation requires, owls might indulge in more aggressive hunting behavior and increased physical activity to meet their energy and nutritional needs. However, imposing artificial heavy exercise on owls could potentially have negative consequences on their overall health and behavior. Increased heavy exercise could lead to higher energy expenditure, potentially causing owls to require additional food intake to meet the increased caloric needs. This increased need for food could place greater pressure on the owl to hunt more frequently and possibly deviate from their typical hunting strategies. As the question addresses the influence of the perturbation on the second effect mentioned (sitting still on a perch and waiting for prey), we can assume increased heavy exercise might cause the owl to become more restless or less patient while waiting for prey. This could potentially lead to less effective hunting due to an inability to remain still and inconspicuous or a reduction in the amount of time spent waiting for prey to approach. Now, let's address how this exercise-induced change in hunting behavior could influence the owl's susceptibility to becoming sickened. If the owl cannot hunt effectively due to the inability to sit still or wait patiently on a perch, it may consume less food, leading to malnutrition, decreased immune system function, and an increased risk of disease or illness. Moreover, excessive physical activity could also cause stress, further impacting the owl's immune function. Therefore, based on the potential challenges and changes in hunting behavior caused by increased heavy exercise, it is reasonable to assume that the owls' risk of becoming sickened would be affected in a \\"more\\" way – implying a higher probability of illness or disease. In conclusion, imposing unnatural heavy exercise on owls could potentially disrupt their hunting habits, most notably, their ability to sit still on a perch and wait for prey. This disruption could negatively influence their overall health and make them more susceptible to sickness. The supposed perturbation would likely have a \\"more\\" effect on the owls' risk of becoming sickened."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Steven David \\"Steve\\" Levitt (born May 29, 1967) is an American economist known for his work in the field of crime, in particular on the link between legalized abortion and crime rates. Winner of the 2003 John Bates Clark Medal, he is currently the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, director of the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He was co-editor of the Journal of Political Economy published by the University of Chicago Press until December 2007. With journalist Stephen J. Dubner, he co-authored the best-selling book Freakonomics (2005) and its sequels SuperFreakonomics (2009) See The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime for a detailed discussion of the issue. Revisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argued that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s. This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said \\"The numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion.

So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion.\\" In 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results (\\"Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?\\" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp. 1 -37.). In 2004, the authors published a response, in which they claimed Joyce's argument was flawed due to omitted-variable bias. In November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz, published a working paper, in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were middle class whites rather than low income minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle class women had the financial means for an abortion. The Economist remarked on the news of the errors that \\"for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another.\\" In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and showed that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Muscat in the sunny Sultanate is a well-kept secret “THE Sultan is close friends with the Queen,” says my local guide, Batir. We Brits are very popular in Oman, even if most of us have barely heard of the place. Exploring this safe, smart and friendly corner of the Middle East feels like stumbling across a closely-kept secret — an old Arabia I had thought was all but lost. But apparently the royals have been escaping to the mysterious sunny sultanate for decades, with the most recent visit from Prince Charles and Camilla in October. It’s the ideal destination for a winter warmer, with some of the best beaches on the Arabian Peninsula bathed in constant sunshine and served by a handful of world-class hotels. And with Oman Air and now British Airways offering direct daily flights from Heathrow to the capital, Muscat, it’s just seven hours to summery sun, glistening sea and lots of sand. Like most people visiting Oman, I made my jumping-off point Muscat, a city of neat neighbourhoods spread over a wide coastal area with a skyline pierced by domes and minarets. As I pulled back the curtains at the Crowne Plaza Muscat on my first day, green parakeets and blue Indian rollers flitted across Al Qurum Bay, welcoming me to the subtropics. Oman Tours picked me up for sightseeing trip, heading straight for the nearby Royal Opera House. It’s an oddity in the Middle East, where such temples to music are forbidden under Islam. This one only exists thanks to the Sultan’s love of music. Muscat’s main attraction is the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, with a Swarovski crystal chandelier and the world’s second-largest Persian rug. The small Bait Al Zubair Museum gives tourists a good grounding in all l things Omani. On the old Muscat waterfront we visited the atmospheric Muttrah Souk, packed with produce including burning frankincense wafting through the labyrinth of lanes. Nearby, I sampled home-cooked Omani cuisine at Bait Al Luban restaurant, hidden in an antique house. The Shangri-La Barr Al Jissah, which combines three hotels in one resort, occupies one of the prettiest spots along Muscat’s coastline. I spent the day wandering through the arches and fountain-filled courtyards of the Arabian palace-style Al Hisn hotel, perched on sea cliffs. Below, the Sea of Oman is a vibrant underwater world, with dolphins, rays, turtles, whale sharks and little reef fish such as blue tangs and puffers. On a dive and snorkelling trip with Oman Sail I was in luck, as a huge pod of playful dolphins arrived to perform tricks in our wake. Oman Sail’s world-class dive centre is based at the Millennium Al Mussanah Resort, about an hour’s drive north of Muscat. From here dive guide Richard led us to the underwater Eden of the Daymaniyat Islands. Diving into the Unesco-protected marine reserve felt like plunging into an aquarium, with great clouds of fish. Back on dry land, Oman’s dashing dunes are another natural highlight. I went quad biking and dune-bashing in the rolling sands, and cycled along the winding paths, enjoying the breeze and Martian-like scenery. In Oman’s cultural centre, Nizwa, I visited the morning cattle market, part of one of Arabia’s oldest souks, where you can buy anything from meat and fruit to incense and coffee pots. Childhood dream Towering over the souk, Nizwa’s fortress is a fine example of an Arabian castle, honey-coloured and round, with a wonderful warren within. Oman has castles in spades. I visited a cluster of them in the historic Al Batinah region, near Muscat. Al Hazm fort was a childhood dream of hidden rooms, staircases and dark passages. At nearby Rustaq fort, bats stirred in the darkness as I descended the stone steps into the bowels of the castle. After exploring ruins in white heat, a trip to the oasis of Ain Thowarah put spring back in my step. But my favourite Omani oasis, just east of Nizwa, was Birkat Al Mawz, an ancient plantation of date palms, banana and mango trees watered by stone aqueducts. Oman is roughly the size of the UK and I only glimpsed a fraction of the country in my week-long trip, but I managed to have an epic sand-and-sandals adventure — all within an hour-and-a-half’s drive from Muscat.

Hot Country Songs is a chart published weekly by \\"Billboard\\" magazine in the United States. This 50-position chart lists the most popular country music songs, calculated weekly by collecting airplay data from Nielsen BDS along with digital sales and streaming. The current number-one song, as of the chart dated for October 7, 2017, is \\"Body Like a Back Road\\" by Sam Hunt. \\"Billboard\\" began compiling the popularity of country songs with its January 8, 1944 issue. Only the genre's most popular jukebox selections were tabulated, with the chart titled \\"Most Played Juke Box Folk Records\\". The chart length was not standardized; a given week had anywhere from two to eight positions. For approximately ten years, from 1948 to 1958, \\"Billboard\\" used three charts to measure the popularity of a given song. In addition to the jukebox chart, these charts included: The names of each chart changed slightly during each chart's life. The \\"jukebox\\" chart – which by 1956 was known as \\"Most Played C&W in Juke Boxes\\" – ended on June 17, 1957. The \\"best sellers\\" and \\"jockeys\\" charts continued until October 13, 1958. Starting with the October 20, 1958 issue, \\"Billboard\\" began combining sales and radio airplay in figuring a song's overall popularity, counting them in one single chart called \\"Hot C&W Sides\\". The chart began with a standard length of 30 positions each week. The name of the chart, and the number of positions varied through the years: Its name was switched to \\"Hot Country Singles\\" on November 3, 1962; it was expanded to 50 slots on January 11, 1964; then 75 on October 15, 1966; and finally 100 beginning July 14, 1973. 1. what is the number one song on the Hot Country Songs chart in this article? 2. as of what date? 3. how many positions are on that chart? 4. does it include streaming data too? 5. who publishes it? 6. is that a tv show? 7. what is it? 8. when did they start tracking the popularity of country songs? 9. what three charts did they use to measure a songs popularity? 10. how long did they use those for? 11. what years did it span? 12. when did the jukebox chart end? 13. did the other charts end at the same time? 14. when did they end? 15. how many positions did the new C&W chart have? 16. when did they start that? 17. did they ever expand the position count? 18. to what? 19. what was the chart named in 1962?

We have a list of comma-separated items, and the task is to return the count of numerical elements in the list. Here is how I think we can solve this problem step by step: Step 1: Initialize a counter variable \`num_count\` to 0. Step 2: Traverse the list. For each item in the list, check if it is numerical. Step 3: In Python, we can do this by using the \`isnumeric()\` string method, which returns True if all the characters are numbers, False otherwise. We will use it in the if condition to increase the count of \`num_count\`. Step 4: After the traversal is complete, return the value of \`num_count\`, which holds the total count of numerical elements in the list. Here is the Python code for these steps: \`\`\`python def count_numerical(list): num_count = 0 for item in list: if item.isnumeric(): num_count += 1 return num_count input_list = ['9697', '2213', '1925', 'Y', 's', 'L', 'A', '2703', '6801', '7431', 'L', 'U', '1893', 'c', 'c', 'Y', 'c', 'u', '5603', 'W', 'M', '1863', 'A', '9285', '3613', '7277'] print(count_numerical(input_list)) \`\`\` The function count_numerical() receives a list, iterates over every element and checks if the current element is numeric. If it is, then it increments the counter, and at the end, it returns the count of numeric elements. This solution works because each item in the list is string. Even the numbers are represented as strings, therefore we can use the isnumeric() method to check if a certain string represents a number. The time complexity of this code is O(n). It traverses the list only once, where n is the size of the list. The isnumeric() method also works in constant time, so the time complexity doesn't increase. The space complexity is O(1). Only a single extra variable is used, so the space complexity is constant. This code should solve the task. Let's run this code and get the answer.

Summarize the following: Look within yourself to decide how comfortable you feel opening up to someone. You may feel more vulnerable at some times than you do at others, and it's okay to guard yourself when you don't feel comfortable. Identify what you are comfortable with, as well as what makes you uncomfortable. Each time you're with someone, take small steps to push yourself to get closer to them while still honoring your comfort level. You might start by offering a nice comment to a coworker. On another encounter, you might offer them a small token of friendship, such as a donut or coffee. When you feel ready, you could invite them to do something. Smile and greet people when you see them. If someone makes small talk with you, participate in the conversation instead of giving them one-word replies. When you see someone you know, take a minute to say hello and ask how they are. If you’re shy, you might be used to minding your own business in public, so start slowly. Work on making eye contact and smiling. When you feel more comfortable, start chatting with people more often. Be willing to meet new people and expand your social horizons. See the good side of your friends and acquaintances, and take an optimistic view of your relationships. If any new opportunities or invitations come your way, accept them. For instance, if your classmate asks you to study with her later, say yes, even if you aren’t sure you’ll like it. Give her (and yourself) a chance. Build connections with other people by being interested in them. Try to find out more about your acquaintances’ goals, families, likes, and dislikes. When you’re with your friends, ask them about any projects they’ve been working on or issues they’ve been dealing with lately. For instance, you could ask something like, “Why did you decide to major in architecture?” or “How are you liking your new apartment?” Of course, you don’t want to ask anything too personal, like “Why are you getting divorced?” unless you know the person well and get the sense that they want to talk about it with you. To maintain a friendship, asking questions isn’t enough – you’ve got to talk about yourself, too. As you get to know people, share more of your thoughts and personality quirks. Opening up to others will make them feel like you’re invested in the relationship. For instance, if your closest pals are sharing their dreams, it might be nice to share your own. You might say, \\"You know I've always secretly dreamed of spending a year traveling the world.\\" Consider telling your close friends that you’re trying to stop pushing others away. That will help your friends understand you better. They may even be able to help you, if you let them. Once you’ve connected with someone, do your best to keep them in your life. Don’t cancel social plans you’ve made, even if you feel anxious. Respond to your friends promptly when they reach out to you, and if you don’t hear from someone for a while, call or text them yourself. Keeping in touch with people can be hard work, especially if you’re used to ducking out of relationships when you get uncomfortable. However, if you want to keep people around, you’ve got to stay on their radar. If you’re really not feeling up to talking, don’t leave your friends hanging. Say something like, “I can’t meet up today, but I’d love to see you soon. How about Thursday?” If you’ve let things lapse with someone you care about, call them up or email them. Explain why you pushed them away, and apologize for any hurt you caused them. If they’re willing to revive the relationship, promise to treat them better in the future. If a former friend doesn’t want to revive the friendship, accept their answer and leave them alone, but let them know they can contact you if they change their mind. Keep in mind that apologizing won’t fix a broken relationship overnight. To make things right in the long term, you’ll have to be a better friend from here on out.","completion":"To build and maintain healthy social connections, start by assessing your comfort level with opening up to others. Understand that it is normal to feel vulnerable at times and protect yourself when you don't feel at ease. Gradually push yourself to get closer to others by offering compliments, small tokens of friendship, and participating in conversations when you are comfortable doing so. Remember to smile and greet people. Work on making eye contact and engaging in small talk. As you gain confidence, be open to meeting new people, expanding your social circle, and being optimistic about your relationships. Accept new opportunities and invitations to strengthen connections. Show genuine interest in others by asking about their goals, families, likes, and dislikes, but avoid asking questions that are too personal unless they seem willing to discuss them with you. In addition to asking questions, share more about yourself as you get to know people, which will help build trust and investment in the relationship. Inform your close friends about any personal struggles you may have, like pushing people away, so they can better understand you and possibly offer support. Once you have connected with someone, make efforts to stay in touch and keep them in your life. Respond to your friends promptly when they reach out, and initiate contact when you haven't heard from them in a while. Avoid canceling social plans due to anxiety and always offer an alternative if you can't make it. Consistently maintaining connections may be challenging, but it's crucial for keeping people around. If you have previously pushed people away, consider reaching out to them, apologizing for any hurt caused, and explaining your actions. Be prepared for the possibility that they might not be willing to revive the relationship. However, if they are, commit to being a better friend moving forward.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

Step 2: Determine the context and tone of the key words The words \\"cold\\" and \\"dead\\" have a negative connotation in the context of a movie review. Step 3: Compare the overall tone to the options provided A. Negative - There is a higher likelihood that this option matches the tone of the review because of the negative connotation of the key words. B. Positive - This option is less likely to be accurate, as the tone of the review seems to be negative.

Please answer this question: What American city produces most of the egg rolls sold in grocery stores in the United States?","completion":"The American city that produces most of the egg rolls sold in grocery stores in the United States is Houston, Texas. An important reason for this is the existence of a massive food manufacturing company named Windsor Foods, which is a leading producer of frozen specialty foods, including various types of Asian appetizers like egg rolls. The company operates several manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, but their largest facility that produces egg rolls is located in Houston. Windsor Foods, now a part of Ajinomoto Foods North America, has been dedicated to producing quality, frozen Asian cuisine, including egg rolls, potstickers, and wontons, for both consumers and foodservice industries. Though their Houston facility specializes in producing egg rolls, they have a wide range of products that cater to different tastes and regions. Houston has become a major hub for such production due to its strategic location, well-established infrastructure, diverse workforce, and easy access to raw materials and logistics networks. The city's proximity to major transportation routes, such as ports and highways, allows for seamless distribution of goods across the country and even to international markets. Additionally, Houston's diverse population and cultural melting pot provide a rich source of skilled labor and expertise in various types of cuisine, including Asian food. Thus, the Houston-based facility of Windsor Foods plays a significant role in producing and supplying egg rolls to grocery stores all over the United States. The company's long-standing commitment to quality and innovation, coupled with the advantages of the city's strategic location and infrastructure, has led Houston to play this crucial role in the American grocery supply chain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ash Mattley, a doctor in a small village deep in the jungles of Borneo, is approached by another scientist, Carl Wessinger regarding his studies of an enzyme found in a rare beetle. With the aid of Mattley and a group of natives, Wessinger secures several of the beetles, but then betrays his team and leaves them behind in a cave. Later, Wessinger uncovers a fossil in the jungle, but the natives in his new team fall in fear and worship before the deceased creature, which they call \\"Balakai.\\" Two years later, Mattley's clinic is beset by a series of gruesome murders in the jungle. The natives attribute the killings to Balakai, who is an ancient myth in the area. Mattley is enlisted by Claire Sommers, a CIA agent, to find Wessinger. The government had been monitoring Wessinger's activities in the jungle after he began working for them, but the doctor had recently fallen off radar, and Sommers reveals she has been sent to track him down. Together with Matzu, a boy whose sister was one of the victims, they set out into the jungle. Mattley does not initially believe that Balakai is real, but Sommers eventually tells him that the CIA was funding Wessinger's research into the fossil, leading him to change his mind.

Summarize this article: He told the Welsh Tories in Llangollen that Wales' future depended on voters making the \\"right choices\\" in the assembly election and EU referendum. The prime minister stressed the value of the EU to farmers in particular. Ex-Welsh Secretary David Jones said he was \\"disappointed\\" Mr Cameron used his platform to promote the EU cause when the party was supposed to be neutral. Addressing party members on Friday, the prime minister said: \\"Let us remember - this isn't some abstract question. \\"These are actually people's jobs, people's livelihoods, people's life chances, people's families we're talking about. \\"I say don't put them at risk - don't take this leap in the dark.\\" Mr Cameron added that he \\"loved Britain, not Brussels\\", but felt it was in the national interest to stay in the EU. Clwyd West MP Mr Jones - who intends to vote to leave the EU in June - said: \\"The party announced last September that it would remain neutral in the referendum campaign. \\"It is therefore very disappointing that the prime minister should use a Conservative conference to promote the Remain cause, particularly when no other speakers are being allowed to speak in favour of Brexit. \\"It is important that everyone in this debate from the leader down should play by the rules if party unity is to be maintained.\\" Two other senior Welsh Conservatives expressed \\"concern\\" and \\"surprise\\" to BBC Wales that the prime minister's speech focused on the EU rather than the assembly campaign and Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies. Earlier on Friday, Mr Davies - who wants the UK to leave the EU - made no reference to the June referendum in his own address to the conference. Instead, he made his bid to win the assembly election in May, saying Welsh Labour was a \\"lazy, complacent\\" government which had \\"run out of steam\\" after 17 years in power. Aside from his comments on Europe, Mr Cameron called on voters to give the Conservatives a chance of power in Cardiff Bay, to deliver \\"real change\\" and create a Welsh \\"powerhouse\\".

Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads.

We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

He talks to you and plays with you. He can even think for himself and figure out what you need. It may feel as if you have a considerate new brother who keeps you company all the time. But come to think of it, can you really trust him? Ever since the first robot was created decades ago, scientists have kept thinking about the task of making robots more like humans. However, as they have gotten closer to that goal, doubts have grown. According to the BBC, Japanese robot designer Masahiro Mori argues that the more lifelike robots become, the more humans feel a connection to them. But once they become too similar to humans, people begin to feel uncomfortable. This theory is what led to the creation of a brand new robot in Switzerland earlier this month. Roboy, as the new machine is called, has various human-like abilities such as hand-shaking and bicycle-riding, but instead of a skin-like covering, Roboy is wrapped in shiny white armor that clearly shows its robot status. \\"As long as people can clearly see that the robot is a machine, even if they project their feelings into it, then they feel comfortable,\\" Rolf Pfeifer, the creator of Roboy from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, told the BBC. But the problem that people have with robots is not just with the way they look. It also has to do with the roles that they play in our lives. A survey last year of European Union countries showed that 88 percent of those interviewed agreed that robots are \\"necessary as they can do jobs that are too hard or dangerous for people\\", such as space exploration and war fighting. But when it comes to taking care of children, 60 percent said that robots should not be allowed to participate, because as robots become more advanced and complicated, parents may tend to hand over too much responsibility to them.

In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu.

Article: In prefix = st1 /America, drivers' education is part of regular high school curriculum. Every student in his or her second year of high school is required to take a class in driver's education. However, unlike other courses, it is not given during the regular school year. Instead, it is a summer course. The course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations and driving time to practise driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students have a text from which they study the basic laws they must know to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone wanting to get a driver's license. Driving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel (steering wheel) and practise starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two-hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and \\"driver\\" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. Drivers Ed cars are unlike other cars in which they have two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and one on the other side where the instructor sits. Thus, if the student driver should run into difficulties the instructor can take over. The car also has another special feature. On the top of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should use extra caution because the student driver is a beginning driver, not very experienced and prone to driving slowly. After the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old), they can go to a designated state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test.

But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk. \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Milan 0-1 Atlético Madrid Atlético Madrid must have wondered how they escaped back to the Vicente Calderón with an unlikely victory after Milan dominated possession without making the vital breakthrough. Diego Costa grabbed the only goal seven minutes from time during a rare foray into enemy territory by the visitors but Milan will look back on a first half in which they could have been home and dry by the interval. Twice they hit the woodwork, first with Kaká. Adel Taarabt teed up the Brazilian who unleashed a shot that was heading for the far top corner until Thibaut Courtois flung himself across goal to tip the ball on to the bar. In the 18th minute it was the post's turn to intervene. Taarabt was involved again, sweeping in a cross which Andrea Poli met perfectly, glancing his header down to the far bottom corner only for Milan to be denied again by the fingertips of Courtois, who got just enough on the ball to deflect it on to the post. Atlético were doing their best to disrupt Milan's rhythm with a succession of petty fouls, Emiliano Insúa seeing yellow for hacking down Mattia De Sciglio, but on the half-hour Kaká was again testing their defence. Mario Balotelli wrongfooted the visitors with a sly backheel and Kaká saw his shot whistle just over the bar. If anything, Atlético stepped up their fouling in the second half, with Balotelli their principal target, but Milan resolutely wasted every free-kick they were given. Balotelli departed after 77 minutes clutching his shoulder after another hefty challenge and was replaced by Giampaolo Pazzini. The substitution coincided with a spell of increased ambition from Atlético, who at last began to get players into the opposition half with some regularity. They almost scored in the 79th minute when Raúl García blazed over from around the penalty spot. In the 83rd minute they did make what may be the tie's decisive breakthrough. Gabi's corner from the right skimmed off the top of Ignazio Abate and Diego Costa crashed his header past the helpless Christian Abbiati.","completion":"Despite dominating possession, Milan were unable to score against Atlético Madrid, who emerged victorious with a 1-0 win.

He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.

The England striker is yet to feature this term due to an ankle injury he suffered in the summer, but is now back in training. In his absence, the Hammers have beaten Liverpool and Manchester City - Premier League runners-up and winners in 2013-14 - and are fourth in the standings after nine games. Andy Carroll takes part in a West Ham training session last Friday at Chadwell Heath training ground. Carroll sprints during training as he prepares to return to action following an ankle injury. Carroll celebrates after scoring for West Ham against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light back in March. 'I think we can push right on for Europe,' Carroll told whufc.com. 'I don't see why not - I think all the lads are positive about that and I know the gaffer is too. 'We're playing fantastically. The gaffer has signed some great players and we're showing the quality we've got with the goals we're scoring. That's why we are where we are in the league.' Allardyce has often been criticised for a direct approach, with targetman Carroll key, but the likes of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho have given the Hammers an added dimension. Diafra Sakho (left) celebrates with Aaron Cresswell after scoring for West Ham against Manchester City. Morgan Amalfitano and Enner Valencia end up in the crowd after West Ham took the lead against City. Carroll has also been keenly watching Aaron Cresswell's performances at left-back and is relishing the chance to work with a player who has delivered accurate crosses time and again this term. The 25-year-old former Newcastle and Liverpool striker added: 'We scored three headers at Burnley, and another on Saturday (against City) with Cresswell crossing the ball in. He whips them in and puts them on a plate. 'The service that everyone is putting in the box to create chances has been great. That's what I thrive on.

For instance, the signings of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho have given West Ham a significant boost. These additions, coupled with their winning performance thus far, have demonstrated the genuine talent on the roster. Furthermore, Carroll is looking forward to playing alongside Aaron Cresswell, a left-back who has consistently provided accurate crosses throughout the season. Commenting on Cresswell's ability, Carroll states, \\"He whips them in and puts them on a plate. The service that everyone is putting in the box to create chances has been great.
