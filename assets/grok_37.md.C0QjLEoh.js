It was always sitting on the shelves alone, until one day I decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. I stared in awe at it, since it was the first ever game for the PS1 that I owned that had 4 discs. When I played it, I couldn't put the controller down, seriously. The storyline of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII Storyline, and that is hard to accomplish. When you play the game, you get so involved with the characters it's unbelievable that it's only a PS1 game, as It feels like a movie. And I believe it should be made into a movie. Too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it, as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves, with a 50% off sign sitting on it, trying to sell. Well I am one of those people who always look at those on the ends, and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good. Heck, that is how I got into final Fantasy VII, looking in a catalog, and finding it. But this is different than Final Fantasy. Legend of Dragoon, is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games, surprisingly. I wouldn't be surprised if it was made by Square Enix but it's not. Hardly any games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is. But what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised, which it should be. Graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? It's PS1 man, made in 1999. Story I have already mentioned is amazing, almost beats VII. Characters are a amazing, you get involved so much with them, and their actions. A definite 10 out of 10. Definitely deserved more praise, and a very well done RPG by a company other than Square Enix. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought positively of the game, not a movie.

Right after the Pentagon was hit, NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft. It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all. After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland. But another aircraft was heading toward Washington, an aircraft about which NORAD had heard nothing: United 93. United Airlines Flight 93 FAA Awareness. At 9:27, after having been in the air for 45 minutes, United 93 acknowledged a transmission from the Cleveland Center controller. This was the last normal contact the FAA had with the flight.

Movie title: Sniper Context: Hartman Fong (Richie Jen) succeeds Shane (Bowie Lam) as the leader of Hong Kong's Special Duties Unit Sniper Team. Hartman who is by-the-book and hierarchical, got the job despite being the second best shooter in team history. The best was Hartman's former teammate Lincoln (Huang Xiaoming), whose unorthodox methods and confidence makes him arrogant and disdainful of authority. Hartman and Lincoln are two alpha males with a long-running rivalry, with only room at the top for one sharpshooter. Lincoln however was dismissed and jailed for accidentally killing a hostage (the son of the bank chairman) during a bank robbery committed by crime boss Tao (Jack Kao). Lincoln maintained in defense that Tao was about to pull the pin of a grenade but no one else on the Sniper Team could support his story, indeed there is a feeling that Hartman (who was the only other person who could have been in a position to see Tao with the grenade) may have withheld key evidence that would have exonerated Lincoln. Back to the present, upon his release from prison after a four-year stint, Lincoln still harbors a grudge against his former SDU teammates despite being welcomed back into society by Shane. Within days Lincoln has purchased an illegal sniper rifle. He also rekindles his relationship with his wife Crystal (Mango Wong) who encourages him to seek revenge, after they view the wedding ring in the aquarium. In a flashback, there are two rookie cops getting involved in criminal shootout. One of them is OJ, who manages to stay calm and kills a criminal. Lincoln sees potential in this youngster and decides to take him under his wing. Yet when OJ becomes fascinated by Lincoln and determines to top his shooting skills, he becomes another wild card on the loose. OJ's unorthodox means leads him into frequent conflicts with Hartman's rigid authoritarian style. Within a few days of being a free man, Lincoln helps crime boss Tao escape prisoner transfer convoy.

Answer the following question: Information: - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - Electronic System is a Belgian synthesizer group (by Dan Lacksman, also known from Telex). - Fibre Channel, or FC, is a high-speed network technology (commonly running at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 128 gigabit per second rates) primarily used to connect computer data storage to servers. Fibre Channel is mainly used in storage area networks (SAN) in commercial data centers. Fibre Channel networks form a switched fabric because they operate in unison as one big switch. Fibre Channel typically runs on optical fiber cables within and between data centers. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - In the computer storage field, a Fibre Channel switch is a network switch compatible with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. It allows the creation of a Fibre Channel fabric, that is currently the core component of most storage area networks (SAN). The fabric is a network of Fibre Channel devices which allows many-to-many communication, device name lookup, security, and redundancy. FC switches implement zoning, a mechanism that disables unwanted traffic between certain fabric nodes. - Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. is an American technology company specializing in data and storage networking products. Originally known for its leadership in Fibre Channel storage networks, the company has expanded its focus to include a wide range of products for New IP and Third platform technologies. Offerings now include routers and switches optimized for data center, campus and carrier environments, IP and Fibre Channel storage network fabrics; Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-defined networking (SDN) solutions such as a commercial edition of the OpenDaylight Project SDN Controller; and network management software that spans physical and virtual devices. - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. - In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products and systems. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are embedded systems (such as traffic lights, consumer appliances, remote controls and digital watches), computers, computer peripherals, mobile phones, and digital cameras. The firmware contained in these devices provides the low-level control program for the device. As of 2013, most firmware can be updated. - A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. It generally includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data communications connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, fire suppression) and various security devices. Large data centers are industrial scale operations using as much electricity as a small town. - A mobile phone is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Most modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and therefore mobile telephones are often also called \\"cellular telephones\\" or \\"cell phones\\". In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming, and digital photography. Mobile phones which offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones. - A storage area network (SAN) is a network which provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to enhance storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as locally attached devices. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network (LAN) by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments. - A digital camera or digicam is a camera that produces digital images that can be stored in a computer, displayed on a screen and printed. Most cameras sold today are digital, and digital cameras are incorporated into many devices ranging from PDAs and mobile phones (called camera phones) to vehicles. - In storage area networking , Fabric OS is the firmware for Brocade Communications Systems 's Fibre Channel switches and Fibre Channel directors . It is also known as FOS and Fabos . After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'fabric os' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - activity - algorithm - area - building - campus - cell - channel - company - computer - computer data storage - data - device - digital camera - dvd - edition - electronics - era - facility - fiber - field - fire - firmware - frequency - goal - group - information - mobile phone - network - operating system - operation - part - photography - radio frequency - range - scale - science - security - sequence - service - set - software - synthesizer - system - technology - television set - user Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, 'fabric os' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of' with 'firmware'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The drying process for a down jacket takes quite a long time, but you can help it along by removing as much moisture as possible from the coat. Run the jacket through two or three additional spin cycles after the second rinse is complete. If possible, increase the speed of the spin with each cycle. Squeeze the jacket by hand to remove excess moisture if you don’t have a washing machine. Don’t wring the jacket, as this could damage the feathers. Then, lay the jacket to hang on a radiator or hang it to dry. After the spin cycles, place your jacket into the dryer along with two or three clean tennis balls. As the tennis balls bounce around in the dryer with the jacket, they will fluff the feathers inside. This fluffing will prevent the feathers from clumping together, and help return their loft. Be warned that the drying process can take up to three hours, but do not increase the heat above low. Higher heat can damage or melt parts of the jacket. Tumble drying is the recommended method for drying down jackets, because air drying can take so long, and eventually the jacket can start to smell. However, if you don’t have a dryer, dry the jacket over a radiator if possible, or hang it to air dry. As the jacket dries, remove it from the dryer every 30 minutes to shake the jacket vigorously and break up feather clumps. You know the jacket is dry when the feathers stop clumping together, and when it feels light and fluffy again. Even if you're radiator or air drying your jacket, be sure to shake it out every half hour to break up clumps. When the jacket is fully dry, give it a final shake. Hang it somewhere to air out for a couple hours before wearing or storing the jacket. Never compress a wet down jacket, as this can destroy some of its ability to insulate properly. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses the proper drying process for a down jacket.

Given the background: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. and the situation: Two rivers spring from the same mountain.

Movie plot title: Seven Movie plot: In an unidentified city of constant rain and urban decay, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is preparing to retire and leave the horrors of the city. Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death. The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti. Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost. Somerset theorizes that a serial killer is basing his crimes on the Seven Deadly Sins, with five more to go.To give Mills and Somerset a chance to get along with each other, Mills's wife, Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) invites Somerset over for dinner. While they are eating, a train passes by on the track nearby, making the building and all its contents and inhabitants tremble: the couple mention that that's why the realtor was so nervous for them to see the apartment quickly. After Tracy goes to bed, Mills and Somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes. They find a picture of Gould's wife with blood painted around the eyes.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who is Erasmus' cousin married to? The novel begins in England during the Age of Enlightenment but long before the days of Darwin and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The novel is broken into two books, beginning in 1752 and 1753 and ending in 1765, with a decade or so separating the two. Matthew Paris is a central character in the novel, a physician several years older than his cousin Erasmus. Prior to the beginning of the story Paris had been imprisoned for writings on the age of the earth that clashed with a literal interpretation of the Bible, his wife Ruth dying while he was incarcerated. Wishing to escape his past, he accepts a position as surgeon on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship built and owned by his uncle William Kemp. The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long-standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father. The ship's crew is made up of men available at the time around the Liverpool docks, and many are recruited by blackmail and deception. As the ship sets off toward the African continent to collect its cargo, it becomes clear that Paris and the ship's captain, Saul Thurso, have very different world views.

Henry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 - December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. Although the surgery was partially successful in controlling his epilepsy, a severe side effect was that he became unable to form new memories. H.M. was widely studied from late 1957 until his death in 2008. His case played an important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. Henry Molaison was born on February 26, 1926, and experienced intractable epilepsy that has sometimes been attributed to a bicycle accident at the age of seven. (This accident was initially reported to have occurred at age nine, but was corrected by the patient's mother at a later stage.) He had partial seizures for many years, and then several tonic-clonic seizures following his 16th birthday. In 1953, he was referred to William Beecher Scoville, a neurosurgeon at Hartford Hospital, for treatment. Scoville localized Molaison's epilepsy to his left and right medial temporal lobes (MTLs) and suggested surgical resection of the MTLs as a treatment. On September 1, 1953, at the age of 27, Molaison's bilateral medial temporal lobe resection included the removal of the hippocampal formation and adjacent structures, including most of the amygdaloid complex and entorhinal cortex. His hippocampi appeared entirely nonfunctional because the remaining 2 cm of hippocampal tissue appeared to have atrophied and because the entire entorhinal cortex, which forms the major sensory input to the hippocampus, was destroyed. Some of his anterolateral temporal cortex was also destroyed. After the surgery, which was partially successful in its primary goal of controlling his epilepsy, Molaison developed severe anterograde amnesia: although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge, but researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the one- to two-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded. However, his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them. The case was first reported in a paper by Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. Near the end of his life, Molaison regularly filled in crossword puzzles. He was able to fill in answers to clues that referred to pre-1953 knowledge. For post-1953 information he was able to modify old memories with new information. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio. He died on December 2, 2008. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What are the symptoms of that?","completion":"I see that the user has not specified what \\"that\\" refers to in the question \\"What are the symptoms of that?\\". To move forward, I'll need to make an assumption based on the context of the provided paragraph. The best match for \\"that\\" based on the paragraph appears to be Molaison's condition post-surgery. Therefore, the symptoms of Molaison's condition post-surgery include: 1. Severe anterograde amnesia: Although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. 2. An impaired ability to form new semantic knowledge: Some scientists believe he was unable to form new factual knowledge, though the extent of this impairment is a matter of debate. 3. Moderate retrograde amnesia: Molaison could not remember most events in the one- to two-year period before surgery, and some events up to 11 years before, suggesting that his amnesia was temporally graded. 4. An intact ability to form long-term procedural memories: Despite his memory impairments, he could learn new motor skills, even though he could not remember learning them. The choice of these symptoms is based on the narrative of Molaison's life post-surgery as described in the paragraph and they directly respond to the user's question.

It may sound simple, but the message is extremely important. \\"Children often don't have the experience to know that when something bad happens---they lose an important game or their best friend lets them down---it's not the end of the world,\\" explains Nancy Leffert, a senior research scientist with the Research Institute, an American adolescents and children's research group. \\"They think their bad feelings will last for ever, or that one failure will ruin everything.\\" Unfortunately, that kind of thinking discourages motivation . \\"If a child believes that the cause of her upset is lasting, or that nothing she does will make a difference, it decreases her ability to keep on trying.\\" says Dorothy Rich, president of the MegaSkills Education Center of the Home and School Institute, based in Washington.

The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. and a hint : Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. Please answer this question : Which wildfire, the one in Texas or the one in Seattle, will have higher intensity? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The wildfire in Texas is likely to have a higher intensity compared to the one in Seattle, based on the given information. There are several factors contributing to this conclusion: 1. Time of the day: The Texas wildfire is occurring during daytime, while the Seattle wildfire is during nighttime. As mentioned in the hint, wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours because of several factors like lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. The sunlight warming the ground during the day also leads to air currents traveling uphill, thereby fanning the wildfires. 2. Geographic location: Texas is situated in the southwest part of the United States, which is known for having a warmer and drier climate compared to the northwest region, where Seattle is located. This difference in climate can contribute to the difference in wildfire intensity between the two locations, with the Texas wildfire being more intense due to its warmer and drier environment. 3. Type of fire: The Texas wildfire is a brush fire, while the Seattle wildfire is a forest fire. Although both types of fire can have varying intensities, brush fires tend to spread more quickly and consume more fuel due to the nature of the vegetation involved. Additionally, since brush fires typically ignite in drier areas, they are more likely to be fed by abundant, easily combustible fuel sources, such as dried grasses and shrubs. Taking all these factors into account, the wildfire in Texas is deemed to have a higher intensity than the one in Seattle. The combined influence of the time of the day, the geographic location, and the type of fire put the Texas wildfire in a more favorable condition for increased intensity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose from options. \\"Which of these is warm-blooded?\\" Choose your answer from: * a frog * a snake * a vulture * a lizard","completion":"The correct answer is a vulture. Let's examine the evidence from the fact that a bird is warm-blooded, and how that connects to the options provided. Warm-blooded animals, also known as endotherms, are able to generate their own body heat and maintain a consistent internal temperature regardless of the external environment. Birds, as well as mammals, fall into this category. In contrast, cold-blooded animals, also known as ectotherms, rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. These animals tend to be more active in warm environments and less active in colder ones. Examples of cold-blooded animals include reptiles and amphibians. Now let's evaluate the options provided: 1. A frog: Frogs are amphibians, which are cold-blooded animals. They depend on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. Therefore, a frog is not warm-blooded. 2. A snake: Snakes are reptiles, another group of cold-blooded animals. Like frogs, they rely on external heat sources to maintain their optimal body temperature. So, a snake is not warm-blooded either. 3. A vulture: Vultures are a type of bird, and as previously mentioned, birds are warm-blooded animals. They can generate their own body heat and maintain a consistent internal temperature, regardless of the external environment. So, a vulture is warm-blooded. 4. A lizard: Lizards, like snakes, are reptiles, which means they are cold-blooded animals. They rely on their environment to regulate their body temperature. Hence, a lizard is not warm-blooded. Considering the evidence from the fact that birds are warm-blooded, we can determine that a vulture is the warm-blooded animal among the options provided. The other three options—frogs, snakes, and lizards—are cold-blooded animals that belong to the categories of amphibians and reptiles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Japanese. Your job is to translate the Japanese sentence into Farsi. Problem:ここに来てインフルエンザが流行します Solution:","completion":"To translate the given Japanese sentence \\"ここに来てインフルエンザが流行します\\" into Farsi, let's break it down step by step. 1. First, let's identify the main elements of the sentence. ここに来て (koko ni kite) means \\"coming here\\" or \\"now that we are here\\". インフルエンザ (influenza) is \\"influenza\\" or \\"flu\\" in English. が (ga) is a subject marker. 流行します (ryūkō shimasu) means \\"It is spreading\\" or \\"It is becoming popular\\". 2. Now, let's find the corresponding Farsi words or expressions for each part: ここに来て (koko ni kite) - حالا که اینجا هستیم (hâlâ ke injâ hastim) インフルエンザ (influenza) - انفلوآنزا (anflūânzâ) 流行します (ryūkō shimasu) - در حال گسترش است (dar hâl-e gostâresh ast) 3. Finally, let's combine the Farsi words and expressions to create the translated sentence: حالا که اینجا هستیم، انفلوآنزا در حال گسترش است (hâlâ ke injâ hastim, anflūânzâ dar hâl-e gostâresh ast) So, the solution is: حالا که اینجا هستیم، انفلوآنزا در حال گسترش است (hâlâ ke injâ hastim, anflūânzâ dar hâl-e gostâresh ast) which means \\"Now that we are here, influenza is spreading.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes (b). No The answer is:","completion":"(b). No While it is true that oak trees do shed their leaves seasonally each year, they are not the only species that exhibit this behavior. Vines, as you have mentioned, also shed their leaves each year, as do many other deciduous plants. Deciduous plants, in general, are those that lose their leaves in response to seasonal changes, typically during the autumn months. This process allows the plants to conserve water and protect themselves from the cold temperatures of winter. Examples of deciduous plants that shed their leaves seasonally each year include: 1. Maples 2. Oaks 3. Beeches 4. Birches 5. Elms 6. Willows 7. Poplars 8. Dogwoods 9. Hawthorns 10. Vines Since the question \\"what sheds their leaves seasonally each year?\\" does not specifically ask for a single answer, but instead inquires about the general category of plants exhibiting this behavior, it would be incorrect to say that the right answer is only \\"oak\\". Instead, a more accurate response would encompass various deciduous trees and plants, including oaks and vines, that shed their leaves seasonally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Original and thought provoking Review: This is a very good movie.Some people might complain that Mel Gibson's graphic use of violence, reminiscent of the Passion of Christ, is excessive but somehow with him, unlike Tarrantino for example, it just doesn't seem to be for the sake of it. The execution scenes in the Mayan capital are very gruesome and probably historically inaccurate but they enhance the movie and bring home just how savage human nature can be beneath the surface, in any culture and at any time.That was also the core message of Conrad's Heart of Darkness and I wondered when I watched this film if Gibson's choice of title \\"Apocalypto\\" and Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now\\", based on The Heart of Darkness, was coincidental.And that's the irony of the ending.

Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the early Permian time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today. Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta. This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color. Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is 100 to 300 feet (30 to 90 m) thick.

They are usually not tightly-packed enough to be picked up, but some images on Twitter show people have succeeded in taking them inside, in a bid to preserve their shapes. Works of art: The last time snow rollers - also known as snow doughnuts - were reported in western","completion":"Pennsylvania was back in 2007, making this recent phenomenon an uncommon and interesting sight for many. Snow rollers form when a certain combination of meteorological conditions is met, creating stunning, ephemeral sculptures that delight and mystify those who are fortunate enough to witness them. Snow rollers, also known as snow doughnuts or snow bales, are cylindrical snow formations that occur when light, fluffy snow is blown by strong winds across a relatively smooth surface, such as a field or lawn. As the snow is blown along, it begins to accumulate and roll, eventually forming a cylinder shape that can vary in size, ranging from as small as a golf ball to as large as a car tire. The delicate nature of the snow means that these sculptures are often short-lived, as they can easily be damaged by further wind, precipitation, or fluctuating temperatures. To form a snow roller, several specific conditions must be met: 1. A layer of ice or crusty snow: The surface beneath the loose snow must be smooth and slippery, which is often achieved after a period of melting followed by a rapid freeze. 2. Loose, powdery snow: The snow must be light and fluffy in order to be easily blown by the wind, and it must also be sticky enough to cling to itself as it rolls. 3. Strong, gusty winds: Winds must be strong enough to initiate rolling, but not so powerful that they break the delicate formations apart. 4. Adequate snow cover: There must be sufficient snow to allow for the continuous accumulation as the rollers form. The rarity of snow rollers can be attributed to the precise conditions necessary for their formation, as well as their evanescent nature.Due to the susceptibility of these sculptures to environmental factors, it is no surprise that people are excited by their appearance and rush to capture photos, as their presence is often fleeting. As the news of snow rollers appearing throughout the Midwest has spread, social media has played a crucial role in sharing images and experiences of this captivating phenomenon. From casual observer to professional photographers, people have been captivated by the whimsical beauty of these fragile formations. Beyond pure aesthetic enjoyment, snow rollers also serve as a striking reminder of the power and intricacy of natural processes. They perfectly illustrate how even the seemingly chaotic force of wind can give rise to delicate and mesmerizing works of art. Weather enthusiasts and curious onlookers alike revel in the opportunity to study and appreciate this rare weather occurrence, reinforcing the importance of maintaining an awareness and respect for the wonders found within our natural world. In conclusion, snow rollers are a rare and enchanting phenomenon that provide a unique glimpse into the artistic capacity of the natural world. The specific combination of meteorological conditions required to create these fragile, wind-sculpted formations ensures that their appearance is an exceptional and treasured event. The delight and fascination surrounding snow rollers, from social media-fueled excitement to scientific intrigue, highlights the endless capacity for wonder that can be derived from our ever-changing and awe-inspiring environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is the logical first step before the owl can fly out into the night and begin performing the subsequent activities mentioned in the process."},{"prompt":"Given the background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. and the situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: An October 22, 1998 article by Dianne Rinehart reported that according to an Angus Read poll, 51 per cent of British Columbians viewed the Nisga'a Final Agreement as a step in the right direction, with 33 per cent of those polled holding the opposite view and 16 per cent unsure of their views. Hypothesis: in the 90's British people by 1/2 agreed with the final agreement","completion":"Yes, we can draw the following hypothesis from the context, but with some modifications to ensure accuracy and clarity: Hypothesis: In the late 1990s, around half of British Columbians agreed with the Nisga'a Final Agreement as a positive step. This hypothesis is derived from the data provided in the context. The context mentions an Angus Read poll from October 22, 1998, in which 51% of British Columbians viewed the Nisga'a Final Agreement as a step in the right direction. It is important to note that in this context, \\"British\\" refers to the residents of British Columbia, a province in Canada, not the people of the United Kingdom. The context also states that 33% of those polled held the opposite view, implying that they believed the Nisga'a Final Agreement was not a step in the right direction. Moreover, 16% of the respondents were unsure of their views. These data points provide a detailed breakdown of the varying opinions on the Nisga'a Final Agreement during that time in British Columbia. To further support this hypothesis, it would be helpful to consider the historical background of the Nisga'a Final Agreement itself. The Nisga'a Final Agreement was a significant treaty negotiation that took place in British Columbia, Canada, in the late 1990s. It was an agreement between the Canadian federal government, the provincial government of British Columbia, and the Nisga'a Nation, a group of indigenous people from the northwest coast of British Columbia. The agreement aimed to address issues such as Nisga'a land ownership, self-government, and financial compensation. It was a complex and contentious issue that raised concerns about the rights of indigenous people in Canada, with many individuals having strong opinions about its impact on Canadian society. Thus, the hypothesis that around half of British Columbians in the late 1990s agreed with the Nisga'a Final Agreement as a positive step is grounded in the context provided by the Angus Read poll. However, it is important to consider that public opinion may have evolved since then or that other factors may have influenced the poll results. Nonetheless, this hypothesis gives us insight into the general opinion climate surrounding the Nisga'a Final Agreement in the late 1990s in British Columbia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Add spaces: Itisdifficulttosaythisistherightwaybecauseitalwaysdependsonthecircumstancesandorganizations.","completion":"It is difficult to say this is the right way because it always depends on the circumstances and organizations. In many situations, determining the most suitable approach to addressing a problem or making a decision is a complex process that requires considering various factors and perspectives. Businesses, institutions, and individuals often need to make decisions in a context that is highly dynamic and unpredictable. As a result, what may be deemed as the most effective solution in one instance might not be the most suitable choice in another. For instance, the effectiveness of a particular management style or decision-making strategy could vary significantly across different organizations given their unique structures, internal cultures, and workforce personalities. In some organizations, a more hierarchical management approach could yield better results, while other firms might benefit from a more decentralized and collaborative approach. Similarly, when it comes to problem-solving, specific methods and tools may prove useful in addressing certain types of issues but may not be as effective if applied to other situations. For example, brainstorming might work for generating creative ideas and identifying viable solutions, while a more analytical approach may be preferable for industries that are highly quantitative and data-driven. Moreover, factors such as organizational size, available resources, industry dynamics, and external pressures could all have a significant bearing on the appropriate course of action. A small start-up, for example, may need to adopt a more flexible and agile mindset to survive and thrive in a highly competitive market, necessitating continuous adaptation and innovation. In contrast, larger corporations may be more constrained by bureaucratic systems and regulations, calling for greater emphasis on stability and risk mitigation. Additionally, the way organizations manage their relationships with stakeholders can play a crucial role in determining the most appropriate course of action. Engaging with customers, employees, suppliers, and others in a manner that effectively balances competing interests and demonstrates a commitment to ethical behavior and social responsibility can ultimately drive success over the long term. In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to identifying the right way to approach various challenges and decisions. The most effective strategies and methods are contingent on a multitude of factors, including the specific circumstances at hand and the broader context in which organizations operate. Decision-makers should aim to remain cognizant of these complexities and adapt their approaches accordingly to ensure that they are best positioned for success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

Summarize this article: Image copyright Artur Żmijewski Image caption Jewish groups want senior Polish officials to condemn the video Holocaust survivor groups have asked the Polish president to explain how artists were able to film a naked game of tag inside a Nazi camp gas chamber. The film shows men and women running around laughing at the former Stutthof camp, where 65,000 people were killed. Game of Tag, shot in 1999 by Artur Żmijewski, was exhibited in Krakow in 2015 despite Israeli objections. But the filming location was not known until this year, following a visit by the British Royal Family. Experts compared footage from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's visit to Stutthof and its gas chamber with the Polish video. In their letter, groups including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which investigates Nazi war criminals, and the Center Organization of Holocaust Survivors in Israel asked President Andrzej Duda if Mr Żmijewski had had permission to make the film and whether there were rules of conduct at Stutthof. They also said that \\"no comment or word of critique was heard from Polish official sources regarding the video\\" and asked President Duda to \\"clearly, properly condemn this so-called artwork\\". Image copyright EPA Image caption The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's visited Stutthof in July \\"It's really outrageous. I hope the Polish president will put in place regulations to make sure stuff like this doesn't happen again,\\" the Wiesenthal Center's chief Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff told the BBC. \\"It was banned in Germany, Estonia took it down when we contacted them. In Poland for some reason, which lost six million people - three million Jews and three million Poles - they didn't get it,\\" he added. Jerusalem-based lawyer David Schonberg first noticed that Mr Żmijewski's video was shot in Stutthof after noticing that footage from William and Catherine's visit in July showed the same stains on the walls, ledge along one side, plughole in the centre and doors at each end. Experts at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem confirmed the finding. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts compared footage from the royal visit to the video Mr Schonberg told the BBC that more important than the video itself was the \\"apparent indifference\\" to it in Poland. \\"This is a problem that needs to be addressed. If people are not sufficiently sensitive to the terrible acts of the Holocaust and do not respect its victims then proper conduct in the sites in Poland cannot be properly secured,\\" he said. \\"This also requires proper scrutiny of these sites and making sure that objectionable materials that are so insensitive to the memory of the Holocaust will not be brought on public display.\\" Mr Schonberg said the video's reception in Poland was particularly hard to understand as the majority of those who died at Stutthof were Polish non-Jews. The 2015 Krakow exhibition, Poland-Israel-Germany - The experience of Auschwitz, was sponsored by the Israeli embassy, which then called for part of the video to be removed after Jewish groups protested. But the Krakow Art Museum said it should be shown because it was a matter of freedom of expression. A description of Mr Żmijewski on the Warsaw Art Museum's website states that the people in the video are having fun, \\"but they are also very serious. They know where they are - in the gas chamber of a former Nazi extermination camp\\". The Baltic death camp where thousands perished ||||| Holocaust survivors have voiced anger over a video artwork that showed naked people playing a game of tag in a Nazi gas chamber. Several Jewish organisations have written jointly to Poland's president Andrzej Duda, demanding to know if authorities gave permission for the footage to be filmed at the Stutthof concentration camp, where 65,000 people were murdered during World War Two. Artur Żmijewski's film, entitled Game of Tag, was displayed at Krakow's Museum of Contemporary Art in 2015 as part of an exhibition about Auschwitz. No details about where it was recorded were divulged at the time, but the work was denounced as \\"revolting and a total insult to the victims\\" by some Jewish leaders. Researchers have now discovered film's location was Stutthof, about 20 miles east of Gdańsk, the Times of Israel reported. The Organisation of Holocaust Survivors in Israel and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, a Jewish research and human rights group, are among those demanding answers from the Polish government and the management at the concentration camp site, which now houses a museum. Their letter to President Andrzej Duda asked whether artists did “obtain permission from the Stutthof administrators to make this video, what rules exist for proper conduct at the site, how these are enforced”. It notes that \\"no comment or word of critique was heard from Polish official sources regarding the video, neither from the Prime Minister’s office, nor from any official or government representative\\". The video was filmed in 1999 and displayed in 2015 in an exhibition titled “Poland – Israel – Germany. The experience of Auschwitz”, which examined the Nazi death camp's impact on public discourse. The exhibition was endorsed and sponsored by the Israeli Embassy in Poland. But after an outcry from Jewish groups, the embassy called for the video be removed. “It is the most disgusting thing I’ve seen in a long time,” Efraim Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Centre’s chief Nazi hunter, said in 2015. “It is just revolting and a total insult to the victims and anyone with any sense of morality or integrity.” The museum withdrew the work in response to criticism but later reinstated it, defending freedom of artistic expression.

First question: What should be one's relation to the internet and its “discussions” in times of studying or important transition phases? Second question: What are some good case studies of the importance of investing in branding, especially as it relates to start-ups? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: One's relation to the internet and its \\"discussions\\" in times of studying or important transition phases should be moderated and carefully managed. The internet can be an extremely valuable source of information and networking opportunities, but it can also be distracting and detrimental to one's productivity if not properly regulated. Here are a few suggestions for effectively managing your time online during these critical periods: 1. Set priorities: Understand the importance of the task at hand, and prioritize your online usage accordingly. Focus on research, educational materials, and resources that directly relate to your studies or the transition you are going through. 2. Limit distractions: Use website blockers, browser extensions, or other tools to minimize distractions caused by social media, news feeds, and other time-wasting sites. 3. Time management: Allocate specific periods of the day for engaging in online discussions, researching, or browsing the web. This will help keep your internet usage in check and ensure you are not compromising on your primary objectives. 4. Curate your online presence: Follow carefully selected forums or discussion boards that are relevant to your study area or the transition phase you are going through. This will help you stay connected with like-minded individuals and gain helpful insights while avoiding unrelated discussions or debates. 5. Use digital tools responsibly: Platforms like Google Scholar, academic databases, and online collaboration tools can greatly enhance your productivity and efficiency when studying or transitioning phases. Use these resources to your advantage, but do not overly rely on them to the point where they become a crutch. Second question: Branding is important in establishing a unique identity for a startup and communicating the company's values and offerings to potential customers. Some good case studies of the importance of investing in branding for start-ups include: 1. Airbnb: The famous online marketplace for hospitality services underwent a complete rebranding exercise in 2014. Its unique logo also referred to as the \\"Bélo\\", combined with a new visual identity, portrayed a sense of belonging and community. This rebranding played a significant role in Airbnb's growth and positioned the company as a global leader in the hospitality industry. 2. Slack: The popular workplace communication tool utilized branding as a vital component of its growth strategy. Slack differentiated itself from other collaboration tools on the market by forging a strong, friendly, and human-centric personality. This branding strategy allowed Slack to resonate with its target audience, making it the go-to choice for businesses of all sizes. 3. Mailchimp: The email marketing platform successfully positioned itself as a user-friendly and powerful tool for small businesses, thanks in large part to its strong and recognizable branding. The company's friendly and quirky mascot \\"Freddie\\" along with its cohesive design language enabled Mailchimp to garner trust among customers, driving adoption and growth. 4. Warby Parker: This innovative eyewear company's branding incorporates a sleek, minimalist design and focuses on its promise to provide affordable, socially responsible, and stylish eyewear. Warby Parker's branding resonated with customers, leading to the company rapidly becoming an iconic brand in the eyewear industry. 5. Casper: The mattress and sleep product start-up cleverly used branding to create a comfortable and friendly image, setting itself apart from traditional mattress retailers. With its simple, clean design and focus on modern customer experience, Casper's branding helped carve a unique niche for the company in a crowded market. In conclusion, the two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question relates to managing one's relationship with the internet during crucial periods in life, while the second question focuses on the importance of branding for start-ups and provides examples of successful case studies."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Here are some essential aspects to consider when preparing your boat for transport: 1. Choose the right boat transport company: Research and select a reliable, experienced, and fully licensed boat transport company that specializes in moving boats like yours. Check online reviews and ask for recommendations from fellow boaters or marinas. Obtain several quotes to compare pricing and services offered. 2. Measure your boat: Accurately measure your boat's dimensions, including length, beam, height, and weight. Providing precise measurements will help the transport company determine the appropriate trailer and equipment needed for the move, ensuring the safety of your boat during transit. 3. Secure and remove all loose items: Before loading the boat onto the trailer, perform a thorough inspection of your vessel. Remove any unsecured items and store them safely to avoid damage or loss. Tie down items that must remain on deck, such as masts, antennas, or dinghies, to prevent movement during transport. 4. Empty fuel and water tanks: To reduce the weight of your boat and minimize potential hazards, drain both fuel and water tanks to a minimal level. Additionally, disconnect and store fuel lines and batteries in a secure location. 5. Protect fragile boat parts: Wrap all fragile components, such as propellers, antennas, and navigation equipment, in protective material. Remove any detachable parts that may pose a risk to the boat during transportation, and store them safely. 6. Inspect the boat's exterior: Check for any existing scratches, dents, or damage to the boat's exterior and take photos for documentation purposes. If any issues arise during the transport process, this documentation will provide valuable evidence when filing a claim with the transport company or their insurance provider. 7. Prepare for loading and unloading: Ensure that proper loading and unloading procedures are in place. This may include securing a spot at a marina that can accommodate both the boat transporter and the boat itself. Make arrangements for any necessary permits and notify the marina staff of the boat's arrival and departure times. 8. Inspect the trailer: If you are using your trailer, make sure it is in good working condition and prepared for the journey. Check the tires, brakes, and hitch, and ensure that all lights are functioning correctly. If the transport company is providing the trailer, inquire about the equipment's condition and maintenance history. 9. Review the transport route: Discuss the transportation route with the boat transport company. Make sure to identify any potential obstacles or challenges along the road, such as low bridges, narrow roads, or weight-restricted roadways, and plan accordingly. 10. Obtain insurance: Ensure that your boat is adequately insured for transport. Verify the boat transport company's insurance coverage and determine if you need additional coverage through your insurance provider for added protection during the move. These steps will help ensure a smooth and stress-free boat transport process. By taking the time to prepare your boat for transport, you can rest assured that both your vessel and your peace of mind will be safeguarded throughout the journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Leigh Griffiths added the second within the space of five minutes. Griffiths fired a third late on. It was the Scotland striker's 32nd goal of an increasingly impressive season. For Celtic, a stressful day ended happily with an important win and the sight of Patrick Roberts, their loan signing from Manchester City, making a bright debut. Celtic finished the match with a convincing attacking midfield trio of Scott Allan, Ryan Christie and Roberts. The three of them combined to set up Griffiths, who rifled home in typically ruthless fashion. Caley Thistle have made strides in the last few months, moving from ninth in the Premiership in mid-December to sixth before this game on the back of an impressive run. In fairness, they took their confidence with them on the road south. The only problem was that they left their finishing power behind. John Hughes' team played some terrific stuff and caused Celtic an amount of trouble before the champions found themselves, Their profligacy was terminal and it started as early as the 18th minute, when an Iain Vigurs free-kick on the left was completely missed by Craig Gordon. Standing alone behind the goalkeeper was Gary Warren, who duly missed the target with a header that could comfortably be described as a sitter. Celtic huffed and puffed, but the best moments all belonged to Inverness. Just after the half-hour, they had a breakaway and a four-on-two with the Celtic defence. They butchered the moment through their own indecision and the marvellous work-rate of Griffiths, who made the key intervention in his own penalty area. There was a restless mood inside the stadium. Celtic's attacking midfield trio of Stuart Armstrong, Stefan Johansen and Mackay-Steven were passive and error-prone and their supporters were not slow in telling them. Boos rang out at the break and, within three minutes of the restart, Inverness were in again. It was another counter-attack, after Mackay-Steven had been hustled off the ball. Jordan Roberts went by the one-paced Erik Sviatchenko with a gob-smacking ease, but his effort was weak and Gordon dealt with it. That was the sliding doors moment for the visitors. Within 11 minutes, Celtic had scored twice and the game was up. In those moments, Hughes, standing motionless on the touchline, must have pondered football's capacity to inflict pain. Mackay-Steven scored the first after Inverness took too long to get rid of a loose ball, the midfielder snapping his shot past goalkeeper Owain Fon Williams. Then it was Griffiths - unsurprisingly - who added a second when he went on a diagonal run across the Inverness penalty area and then fired across Fon Williams and into the corner of his net. Celtic bossed it from there. Johansen should have made it three but missed, much to the chagrin of the home crowd. Their top scorer's second, and Celtic's third, was a classic moment of Griffiths efficiency, aided and abetted by three young players who warrant a lot more game time in the coming months.

Joseph Guilherme Raposo, OIH (February 8, 1937 - February 5, 1989) was a Portuguese-American composer, songwriter, pianist, television writer and lyricist, best known for his work on the children's television series Sesame Street, for which he wrote the theme song, as well as classic songs such as \\"Bein' Green\\" and \\"C Is For Cookie\\". He also wrote music for television shows such as The Electric Company, Shining Time Station and the sitcoms Three's Company and The Ropers, including their theme songs. In addition to these works, Raposo also composed extensively for the DePatie-Freleng Enterprises such as Halloween Is Grinch Night, Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You? and The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat. In 1971, Children's Television Workshop created the show The Electric Company, meant to help teach reading to children who had outgrown Sesame Street. Raposo served as the musical director of the show for its first three seasons, and contributed songs throughout the show's run, until 1977. Raposo performed joke characters for film segments on The Electric Company similar in style to what he had done on Sesame Street. One segment showed him attempting to get dressed in jacket and necktie against a white wall under the word \\"dressing\\", until the prefix \\"un-\\" appears and attaches itself to the prior word, forcing him to engage in a mock striptease which ends with him modestly hopping off-screen and tossing the remainder of his clothing into an empty chair left on-screen. In a variation of this film, he is shown packing a suitcase when the \\"un-\\" prefix returns and pesters him using the behavior of a meddling fly until, exasperated, Raposo strikes the word with a hammer, knocking it unconscious into the suitcase, which he then triumphantly slams shut with a smirk. Raposo enjoyed doing animation voicework. Other forays of his into the craft included both the tenor singing role of \\"master pickler\\" Gil Gickler in DePatie-Freleng's Dr. Seuss cartoon program Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You? and Gickler's spoken dialogue. Raposo also performed at least three other character voices in the cartoon, including a Groogen musician whose \\"flugel bugle\\" is destroyed by Pontoffel in an attack flyover, as the ancient Senior Fairy above McGillicuddy who oversees the fairy squadron's worldwide search for the missing Pock and his piano, and as an angry Groogen dairywoman spilt milk upon by a too-close fly-by of Pontoffel's. The HBO animated adaptation of Madeline, for which Raposo composed the music and songs (with writer/lyricist Judy Rothman), aired four months after Raposo's death; the cartoon The Smoggies, for which Raposo wrote the theme song, premiered in Canada.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many years did he write songs?","completion":"Joseph Guilherme Raposo wrote songs for many years. It's not clear exactly how many years he wrote songs, but he worked on Sesame Street from the beginning in 1969 and continued to write songs for different projects until his death in 1989.

Q:The city's community garden was demolished for yet another what? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - wasteland - ocean - desert - parking lot - flowers A:","completion":"The city's community garden was demolished for yet another parking lot. Considering the options provided, the most suitable answer would be \\"parking lot\\" because it is a possibility in an urban environment. A community garden is usually a shared green space located within a city, where the members of the community plant and tend to various types of flowers, edible plants, and other flora. It serves as a beautiful and useful space for local residents, but can also be a valuable piece of real estate for other purposes, especially if it is located in a densely populated area. The idea of converting a community garden into a wasteland, ocean, or desert is not feasible since these are natural landscapes and typically cannot be artificially created within a city. Moreover, these options do not make logical sense as there are no benefits in intentionally creating these environments in an urban area. In contrast, a parking lot, although it is an unfortunate loss of a valuable community space, can be created in an urban setting and may be needed to accommodate the increasing number of vehicles in the city. As for the option of replacing the community garden with flowers, though a potential idea, it still does not present any clear indication of why or for what reason the garden was demolished. It is important to consider the context and purpose behind the demolition of the community garden, and a simple garden of flowers would not seem to be a logical or sustainable reason to demolish an existing, thriving area. In conclusion, based on the provided options, the most suitable answer to the question is that the city's community garden was demolished for yet another parking lot. This represents the unfortunate reality that many green spaces in urban environments face: the continuous pressures of urbanization and the need for new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population can lead to the elimination of valuable green spaces, even though they provide essential services and amenities to the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Q: What is the process in which a liquid changes to a solid? Choices: - condensation - boiling - melting - freezing A: Answer:","completion":"The process in which a liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. Freezing, also known as solidification, is a phase transition that occurs when a substance loses its thermal energy and its temperature decreases, eventually reaching the substance's freezing point. At this point, the motion of its particles slows down significantly, and the substance begins to form a crystalline structure as it transitions from a liquid state to a solid state. To further understand the freezing process, let us delve into some of its main aspects: 1. Freezing point: The freezing point is the temperature at which a liquid turns into a solid. For water, this occurs at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard conditions (1 atmosphere pressure). However, the freezing points of other substances may vary depending on their chemical properties and the external pressure applied. 2. Crystalline structure: As a liquid cools down and its particles lose energy, they begin to slow down and arrange themselves in a fixed and orderly pattern called a crystalline structure. This structure is characteristic of solid materials, giving them their rigidity and resistance to deformation. 3. Latent heat of fusion: The latent heat of fusion, also known as the enthalpy of fusion, is the heat energy required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid state at its melting point (and vice versa) without any change in temperature. During freezing, the substance releases this latent heat as it changes to a solid state, while the substance absorbs the heat when melting. 4. Supercooling: In some cases, a liquid can be cooled below its freezing point without transitioning to a solid—a phenomenon known as supercooling. This can be observed when water droplets in clouds remain in a liquid state even when the temperature is below freezing. Eventually, these supercooled droplets may come into contact with a surface or particles in the air, acting as a nucleus and triggering the freezing process. 5. Purity and freezing point depression: The presence of impurities or solutes in a liquid can affect its freezing point—a concept known as freezing point depression. The addition of solute particles disrupts the crystal formation process and requires a lower temperature for the substance to freeze. For example, adding salt to water lowers its freezing point, leading to the use of salt in winter to de-ice roads and sidewalks. In conclusion, the process in which a liquid changes to a solid is freezing. This process involves the cooling of the substance, the formation of crystalline structures, and the release of latent heat of fusion. It is important to note that the freezing point, crystallization, and other factors related to freezing may vary depending on the purity of the substance and the presence of other components."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His successor, Napoleon III, and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The successor improvement that made a significant contribution to sanitation in Paris during Napoleon III's reign and Haussmann's tenure as prefect of the Seine can be credited to a combination of several pivotal advancements in urban planning and infrastructure. One of the most notable improvements was the construction and modernization of the city's sewer system under their guidance. Before delving into the details of these improvements, it is essential to acknowledge the background and context of the time. In the mid-19th century, the streets of Paris were congested, and the city's infrastructure was deteriorating. This led to a multitude of sanitation issues, including poor waste management, contaminated drinking water, and the rapid spread of diseases such as cholera. Napoleon III and Haussmann were determined to address these problems through a series of large-scale public works projects aimed at transforming Paris into a modern, clean, and functional city. One major successor improvement that significantly contributed to sanitation was the development of a centralized and efficient sewer system. Under Haussmann's direction, an expansive network of sewers was constructed, replacing the outdated and insufficient sewer system that predated their administration. These new sewers were larger and better equipped to handle the increasing amounts of waste produced by Paris' growing population. Additionally, they were designed to prevent waste accumulation and facilitate regular maintenance, which greatly improved overall sanitation and the health of the city. In conjunction with the new sewer system, Haussmann's efforts to redesign the streets of Paris also had a significant impact on sanitation. The construction of wide boulevards enabled better circulation of air and sunlight, reducing dampness and improving overall cleanliness. Furthermore, these wider streets facilitated easier access for sanitation workers and other officials tasked with maintaining clean and healthy conditions in the city. Another key improvement was the construction of new aqueducts and water infrastructure to supply clean water to the city's inhabitants. By providing a centrally controlled and regulated supply of water, it became easier to prevent contamination and ensure the overall safety and hygiene of the city's drinking water supply. Lastly, the creation of new parks, such as the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, contributed to improved sanitation by providing green spaces for residents to enjoy. These parks not only offered recreational opportunities but also functioned as \\"lungs\\" for the city, offering fresh air and enhancing the overall quality of the urban environment. In conclusion, the successor improvement that contributed to sanitation in Paris during Napoleon III's reign and Haussmann's tenure as the prefect of the Seine can be attributed to an array of advancements in urban planning, infrastructure, sewer systems, and water supply management. These large-scale public works projects radically transformed the city, laying the foundation for modern Paris and its impressive standards of cleanliness and public health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Two friends studied different planets for their school project. Sean studied Earth's atmosphere, while Bill studied Venus's and Mercury's. Which friend studied less about clouds made of sulfur dioxide? A:","completion":"Sean studied less about clouds made of sulfur dioxide. In their school project, Sean focused on Earth's atmosphere, while Bill studied Venus's and Mercury's atmospheres. Earth's clouds are primarily composed of water vapor, making them different from Venus's clouds, which consist of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. Given that sulfur dioxide is a significant component of Venus's clouds, it's safe to say that Bill, who researched Venus's atmosphere, would have studied more about clouds composed of sulfur dioxide. Meanwhile, Sean focused on Earth's atmosphere, where clouds of sulfur dioxide are less prevalent. Consequently, Sean is the friend who studied less about clouds made of sulfur dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who has devised and elaborate scheme against Lufton with Pindalest? , can you please find it? Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The full name of the person who has devised an elaborate scheme against John Lufton with Jake Pindalest is Tate Riling. Tate Riling is a smooth-talking individual and an old friend of Jim Garry, the protagonist of the story. Riling and Pindalest aim to force Lufton to sell his cattle at a significantly low price by manipulating various situations and taking advantage of the government's orders to remove the cattle from the Indian reservation.

Explanation: The first method mentioned (without circling bad area with a colored marker) is the correct answer because it provides a complete and effective approach to test for leaks in flotation devices. By filling each inflatable device with air and spraying it with a soap-and-water mixture, you can observe if any bubbles are formed, which would indicate air escaping and thus a leak. Repeating this process for each device helps ensure their leak-proof nature before mounting. The second method (circling bad area with a colored marker) is incorrect as it only differs from the first method by including an unnecessary step. Circling the bad area with a colored marker is not a part of the process to check if the flotation devices are leak-proof. While marking the leak location could be helpful in repairing the device later, it is not essential to the goal of checking for leaks."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"If by \\"suppose eggs happens\\" you mean an increase or decrease in the number of eggs used in the batter or a change in the way eggs are incorporated, it could have an effect on the process and the resulting pancakes. 1. If more eggs are used, the batter may become denser, and the pancakes might end up thicker and less fluffy. This change could require an adjustment to the cooking time and temperature to ensure that the pancakes cook evenly. 2. If fewer eggs are used or if no eggs are used, the pancakes could lack structure and be less fluffy or more delicate. It might be necessary to adjust other ingredients (e.g., adding a different leavening agent or a binding ingredient like flaxseed) to achieve the desired pancake texture. 3. If the incorporation method for eggs changes, such as beating them separately to create a foam before folding them into the batter, this could result in fluffier pancakes as the air trapped in the foam will help the pancakes to rise during cooking. Overall, the perturbation to the egg content or method could have both direct and indirect effects on the pancake-making process, and adjustments may need to be made.

Flo Rida's debut studio album, 2008's Mail on Sunday, reached number four in the US. The album was succeeded by R.O.O.T.S., the next year. Flo Rida was born as Tramar Lacel Dillard in Carol City, Florida, on September 17, 1979. His parents raised him and his seven sisters together, some of whom sang in a local gospel group. His brother-in-law was a hype man for local rap group 2 Live Crew, and while in ninth grade, Flo Rida joined an amateur rap group called the GroundHoggz. The GroundHoggz had been a three-man group, with members who lived in the same apartment complex as Flo Rida. They started recording at underground studios in Carver Ranches. The GroundHoggz, in this four-man incarnation, remained together for eight years. While performing, Fresh Kid Ice of 2 Live Crew took notice and asked him to be his hype man, a shortly after he took him for a show in Hawaii. They developed a long lasting friendship, Flo Rida considers this period as his schooling. He would often bring his group around when performing with him. They were eventually all invited as featured guests on Fresh Kid Ice's fourth album Freaky Chinese (2004). Flo Rida's work with 2 Live Crew member Fresh Kid Ice, attracted the attention of DeVante Swing, a member of the band Jodeci. However, he was rejected by several of the major labels, so he sought many other jobs outside of music. After graduating from high school in 1998, he studied international business management at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for two months and attended Barry University for two months.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. I am facing a new situation today: Iceland and Ireland both used agriculture as a the main component of their economies. Ireland used lots of fertilizer and had big environmental problems as a result. Iceland does a lot of greenhouse agriculture using geothermal energy, so it is more protective towards the environment. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country had less fertilizer in their bodies of water? A:","completion":"A: Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it appears that Iceland likely had less fertilizer in their bodies of water compared to Ireland. The background article discusses how rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away into bodies of water, which can lead to harmful algae growth and the creation of dead zones due to oxygen depletion. In the new situation, we learn that Ireland used significant amounts of fertilizer in their agriculture, which likely led to the aforementioned environmental issues. On the other hand, Iceland is known for using greenhouse agriculture powered by geothermal energy, which is a more environmentally friendly approach. Greenhouse agriculture allows for the controlled use of water, nutrients, and other resources, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable farming method. As such, it is less likely for excessive fertilizer runoffs to occur in Iceland. Moreover, utilizing geothermal energy, a renewable and clean source of power, further contributes to the reduction of environmental hazards. In conclusion, considering the environmental implications of traditional agriculture involving heavy use of fertilizer, as experienced by Ireland, and the more sustainable and controlled approach of greenhouse agriculture in Iceland, it is reasonable to infer that Iceland had less fertilizer in their bodies of water compared to Ireland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the following context: The group opened 1965 with their first tour of Australia and New Zealand, with Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales, on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate the police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.Following a mid-year tour of the United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the British Invasion. Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, \\"Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like \\"Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can come over here and make a career for himself.\\" following which a punch was thrown and the AFM banned them.A stopover in Bombay, India, during the band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies to write the song \\"See My Friends\\", released as a single in July 1965.

The answer is:","completion":"The group that opened 1965 with their first tour of Australia and New Zealand, along with Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs, is not explicitly named in the provided context. However, the context suggests that the group in question had members named Avory and Dave Davies and was involved in several incidents involving on-stage fights, a ban by the American Federation of Musicians, and the creation of the song \\"See My Friends.\\" These details match with the well-known British rock band \\"The Kinks.\\" Formed in 1964, The Kinks consists of members Ray Davies, Dave Davies, Mick Avory, and Pete Quaife.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

Which entity is this text about? \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" is a Christmas carol that tells a story of a Bohemian king going on a journey and braving harsh winter weather to give alms to a poor peasant on the Feast of Stephen (December 26, the Second Day of Christmas). During the journey, his page is about to give up the struggle against the cold weather, but is enabled to continue by following the king's footprints, step for step, through the deep snow. The legend is based on the life of the historical Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia or Svaty Vaclav in Czech (907-935). The name Wenceslas is a Latinised version of the modern Czech language \\"Vaclav\\". The tune is that of \\"Tempus adest floridum\\" (\\"It is time for flowering\\"), a 13th-century spring carol in 76 76 Doubled Trochaic metre first published in the Finnish song book Piae Cantiones in 1582. Piae Cantiones is a collection of seventy-four songs compiled by Jaakko Suomalainen, the Protestant headmaster of Turku Cathedral School, and published by Theodoric Petri, a young Catholic printer. The book is a unique document of European songs intended not only for use in church, but also schools, thus making the collection a unique record of the late medieval period. A text beginning substantially the same as the 1582 \\"Piae\\" version is also found in the German manuscript collection Carmina Burana as CB 142, where it is substantially more carnal; CB 142 has clerics and virgins playing the \\"game of Venus\\" (goddess of love) in the meadows, while in the Piae version they are praising the Lord from the bottom of their hearts. The text of Neale's carol bears no relationship to the words of \\"Tempus Adest Floridum\\". In or around 1853, G. J. R. Gordon, the British envoy and minister in Stockholm, gave a rare copy of the 1582 edition of Piae Cantiones to Neale, who was Warden of Sackville College, East Grinstead, Sussex and to the Reverend Thomas Helmore (Vice-Principal of St. Mark's College, Chelsea). The book was entirely unknown in England at that time. Neale translated some of the carols and hymns, and in 1853, he and Helmore published twelve carols in Carols for Christmas-tide (with music from Piae Cantiones). In 1854, they published a dozen more in Carols for Easter-tide and it was in these collections that Neale's original hymn was first published. The tune has also been used for the Christmas hymn Mary Gently Laid Her Child, by Joseph S. Cook (1859-1933); GIA's hymnal, Worship uses \\"Tempus Adest Floridum\\" only for Cook's hymn. Entity:","completion":"The text is about the Christmas carol \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" and its origins. It discusses the story of Bohemian King Wenceslas I, upon which the carol is based, as well as the tune \\"Tempus adest floridum\\" from the Finnish songbook Piae Cantiones.

The statement implies that there are still remains of the historic castle present that allow it to overlook the town. Kendal Castle is a significant historical site located in Kendal, Cumbria, England. It is believed that the castle was built in the late 12th century, serving as an important stronghold and residence for local nobility, including the barons of Kendal. Over the centuries, the castle has experienced natural deterioration, damage from weather, and the passage of time, leading to the current state of ruins. However, the phrase \\"overlook the town\\" signifies that there are sufficient remnants of the castle structure remaining to be visible from the town and perhaps even offering a vantage point to look over the town. This contradicts the hypothesis that states the remains of Kendal Castle are completely gone.

Washington (CNN) -- Republican leaders will propose cutting more spending to balance the amount of additional disaster relief money in a short-term government spending measure defeated earlier by the House, two Republican sources told CNN on Thursday. The additional spending cut, called an offset, would be roughly 100 million from a Department of Energy loan program linked to the solar panel firm Solyndra, which recently collapsed, said the sources -- a GOP aide and a Republican member of Congress -- who spoke on condition of not being identified. The plan, which faces sharp Democratic opposition, could pave the way for a partial government shutdown when the current fiscal year ends on September 30 if it is not resolved. This time, the speaker threatened members with pulling them from committee assignments if they failed to support the continuing resolution on Wednesday, according to a Republican source who attended the","completion":"meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity. The new proposal, with the added spending cuts, is expected to gain more support from conservative Republicans who previously opposed the initial bill. Democrats, however, argue the additional cuts are unnecessary and could hurt the nation's already struggling clean energy industry. They claim the offsets are simply a political move by Republicans attempting to capitalize on the Solyndra scandal, which has become an emblem of failed government investments in green technology. As September 30 approaches, both parties continue to blame each other for the impending shutdown. Republican leaders insist on their demand for more spending cuts, while Democrats point out that the disaster relief aid should not be held hostage to partisan wrangling. In a last-minute effort to avert a government shutdown, several members of both parties come together behind closed doors to negotiate an agreement. The compromise includes a smaller offset than initially proposed by the Republicans, which focuses only on wasteful spending within the Department of Energy loan program, while preserving funding for other vital clean energy initiatives. The bipartisan deal is reached just hours before the deadline, averting a potentially disastrous government shutdown. The House quickly passes the compromise bill, followed by approval in the Senate and the president's signature. Disaster relief aid is provided with minimal delays, allowing affected communities to start rebuilding. Funding for the clean energy sector is maintained, but with increased scrutiny and oversight to prevent future Solyndra-like situations. While the immediate crisis is averted, the last-minute compromise only serves as a temporary solution to the long-standing disagreement between Republicans and Democrats on government spending. Both parties declare victory to their constituents: Republicans claim they successfully pressured Democrats to address wasteful spending and be more fiscally responsible, while Democrats argue they successfully pushed back against harmful Republican austerity measures and defended important clean energy initiatives. However, this victory is short-lived, as the fundamental disagreement between the two parties on spending priorities, debt, and economic policy only deepens the political divide between them. As the nation moves closer to the next fiscal year, new battles over the budget and spending priorities loom on the horizon, threatening to repeat the cycle of brinkmanship and last-minute deals. In conclusion, the story ends with a temporary compromise, which averts a government shutdown and provides disaster relief funding. Nonetheless, the underlying issues of partisan disagreements on spending, debt, and economic policy remain unresolved, setting the stage for future confrontations between the two parties. While this particular situation was diffused, it serves as yet another reminder of the deep ideological divide in American politics and the challenges faced in bridging that divide for the good of the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the US presidential election of 1916, Paul and the NWP campaigned in western states where women could already vote against the continuing refusal of President Woodrow Wilson and other incumbent Democrats to actively support the Suffrage Amendment. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest and picketing at the White House. The pickets, participating in a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign known as the \\"Silent Sentinels,\\" held banners demanding the right to vote. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, many people viewed the picketing Silent Sentinels as disloyal. In June 1917, picketers were arrested on charges of \\"obstructing traffic.\\" Over the next six months, many, including Alice, were convicted and incarcerated at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia (which later became the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the District of Columbia Jail. When the public heard the news of the first arrests some were surprised that leading suffragists and very well-connected women were going to prison for peacefully protesting. President Wilson received bad publicity from this event, and was livid with the position he was forced into. He quickly pardoned the first women arrested on July 19, two days after they had been sentenced, but reporting on the arrests and abuses continued. The Boston Journal, for example, stated, \\"The little band representing the NWP has been abused and bruised by government clerks, soldiers and sailors until its efforts to attract the President's attention has sunk into the conscience of the whole nation.\\" Suffragists continued picketing outside the White House after the Wilson pardon, and throughout World War I.

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences.

As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield. 20th Century Fox announced on April 1, 2006 that the film would be released worldwide on July 27, 2007. The film was released a day earlier in Australia and the United Kingdom. Little information about the plot was released in the weeks building up to the film's release.

This statement implies that the speaker or group the speaker represents has been under significant influence or pressure from lobbyists, whether these are individuals, organizations, or corporations seeking to advance their own interests. Lobbying is a common practice in political and business arenas where entities strive to sway the decision-making process in their favor. Often lobbyists use persuasion, information, or other means to influence those in a position to make decisions. This influence can be positive or negative. Positive lobbying can serve to highlight areas of collective concern, bringing important issues to the forefront of our attention that need to be addressed. But on the negative side, lobbying can sometimes exert undue influence and benefit a select few at the expense of the majority. Saying \\"if such proof was needed\\" infers that for the speaker, the fact they're lobbying in the first place demonstrates their inherent influence and possibly the imbalances associated with it. Still, they seem to acknowledge that others might require more tangible, concrete evidence to be convinced of the lobbyists' impact.

Constipation is not a glamorous topic, but it’s certainly important, especially in older adults. As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.

Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command: 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view. 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view. 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row. 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments. 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column. 6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column. 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column. 8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column. 9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. 10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance. 11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument. 12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments. 13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument. 14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument. 15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument. 16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table 17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. 20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. Input: round_eq { avg { all_rows ; time } ; 2:08.00.0 } Output:","completion":"In this task, you are asked to classify a command into one of seven categories based on its function. The command provided is: round_eq { avg { all_rows ; time } ; 2:08.00.0 } To classify the command, let's break it down step by step: 1. \\"round_eq\\" checks if the two arguments are roughly equal under a certain tolerance. 2. \\"avg { all_rows ; time }\\" calculates the average value of the 'time' column for all rows of the table. 3. \\"2:08.00.0\\" is a given reference value to compare with the average value computed in step 2. By looking at these steps, we can see that this command calculates the average value of the 'time' column over the entire table and compares it with a given reference value to check if they are roughly equal within a specific tolerance. This falls under the category of \\"aggregation\\" as it describes the average value over a column, with the scope of all table rows.

Mao Asada (Qian Tian Zhen Yang , Asada Mao, born September 25, 1990) is a former Japanese competitive figure skater. She is the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World champion (2008, 2010, 2014), a three-time Four Continents champion (2008, 2010, 2013), and a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2005-06, 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14). She is the only female figure skater who has landed three triple Axel jumps in one competition, which she achieved at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Asada moved from Japan to the United States in August 2006 to train with Rafael Arutyunyan in Lake Arrowhead, California. There she was able to escape the overcrowding of Japanese rinks and the pressure of the Japanese media. At her first event, the 2006 Skate America, Asada won the bronze medal behind Miki Ando and Kimmie Meissner. Asada had won the short program, but was fourth in the free skating, finishing with a total score 171.23 points. She was 21.36 points out of first place. Asada won her second event, the 2006 NHK Trophy with 199.52 points, setting the highest combined score in a Ladies' competition under the ISU Judging System and consequently, a world record. Her margin of victory was 20.21 points ahead of silver medalist Fumie Suguri. Asada went into the 2006-07 Grand Prix Final as the reigning champion. She placed second with 172.52 points, 11.68 behind gold medalist Yuna Kim. Asada had won the short program, but placed fourth in the free skating. Asada won the 2006-07 Japan Championships by 26.11 points ahead of silver medalist Miki Ando. At the 2007 Worlds Championships, Asada was fifth in the short program, 10.03 points behind Yuna Kim, who placed first in that section of the competition with a score of 71.95 points, setting a new world record for the highest short program score. Asada won the free skating with a score of 133.13 points, setting a new world record for the highest free skating score, a record which stood for eight months. During her free skating, she successfully landed a triple axel, a triple flip-triple loop combination, a double axel, a triple lutz, a triple flip, and a triple lutz-double loop-double loop combination but under-rotated the second jump of a double axel-triple toe loop combination. She won the silver medal at her first Senior World Championships appearance, earning an overall of 194.95 points, 0.64 behind gold medalist Miki Ando and 8.31 ahead of Yuna Kim, who won the bronze.

Context: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Movie title: Red Riding Hood Movie plot: Set during a cold winter in a snow-covered forest during an undeterminate year of the Medivel times, Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) is a young woman living in the small village of Daggerhorn. She is in love with the woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), but her parents Cesaire (Billy Burke) and Suzette (Virginia Madsen) have promised wealthy blacksmith Adrian Lazar (Michael Shanks) that Valerie will marry his son Henry (Max Irons) hoping Valerie will marry into wealth so she and they can live off Lazar's money.Valerie plans to run away with Peter, but their plans are put on hold when the town sirens erupt, telling the couple that the werewolf who terrorizes their village has struck again. On closer inspection of the victim (found among a field of haystacks), it is found to be Lucy, Valerie's older sister. The townspeople offer a monthly sacrifice to the beast and stay away from the woods but Lucy ventured there after discovering that Valerie had been promised in engagement to Henry, whom Lucy loved.Adrian, Henry, Peter, Cesaire, and the other men venture out into the woods to a mountain cave hunt the Wolf. Against Henry's protest, the group splits into two groups and Henry and his father are attacked. The others manage to behead the wolf, but it kills Adrian in the process. The men bring back the head of a common gray wolf, thinking it is the one that has been terrorizing the village.Valerie sees Suzette crying over Adrian's body and confronts her. Suzette admits that she and Adrian once had an affair and that Lucy is actually his daughter as well as Henry's half-sister. This is the reason why she could not be offered to him. Valerie also learns that Cesaire is seemingly unaware of this.The townspeople decide to celebrate the death of the wolf, but their preparations are interrupted by the arrival of famous witch hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), who reveals that the townspeople did not slaughter the real Wolf because it would have changed back into its human form if they did. Solomon knows this because he... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Red Riding Hood, it is not explicitly mentioned who takes Valerie to the church. However, given the context and the setting of the film, it is likely that her family, including her parents Cesaire and Suzette, would accompany her to the church for various events and gatherings, especially considering the close-knit nature of the small village of Daggerhorn. The movie's plot revolves around the love triangle between Valerie, Peter, and Henry, set against the backdrop of a village terrorized by a werewolf. In the midst of these complicated relationships and the looming threat of the werewolf, the villagers turn to their faith and community for support and guidance. During the course of the movie, the village seeks the help of Father Solomon, a renowned witch hunter, to deal with the werewolf problem. This situation would have inevitably led Valerie and other villagers to interact with him and attend the church where he presided over various events and ceremonies. While we cannot confirm who exactly takes Valerie to the church, it can be inferred that her family members, including her parents, would play a significant role in accompanying her when the need arises. In conclusion, the movie Red Riding Hood does not provide a direct answer to the question of who takes Valerie to the church. However, considering the social dynamics of the village and the involvement of her family in her life, it can be reasonably assumed that her parents or other family members would accompany her when necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Former model Maria Wyeth, who comes from a Nevada town with a population of 28, is now a successful actress. But she is unhappily married to, and separated from, temperamental producer Carter Lang and also chronically depressed and institutionalized. Reflecting back on what brought her here, Maria recalls driving around Los Angeles in her yellow Chevrolet Corvette and spending time with her closest friend, B.Z. Mendenhall, an unhappy man who is gay. Maria has a brain-damaged daughter, Kate, who is being kept in a sanitarium at the insistence of Carter, who resents Maria visiting the girl so frequently. Maria's secret desire is to live somewhere with Kate and find some kind of joy in life together. Maria has been having an affair with Les Goodwin, a screenwriter. When she tells Carter she is pregnant, he demands she get an abortion. Maria goes to Las Vegas and has a fling with a mob-connected lawyer, Larry Kulik, and later returns to L.A. and has a one-night stand with Johnny Waters, a television star who needs to watch his own show on TV to get in the mood.

They determined that the most likely source of the problem was an island off the coast, where a series of strange seismic events and weather anomalies had been reported over the past few days. Armed with this information, Traiven, Shawn, and Joker set out on a reconnaissance mission to the island. They traveled by air, flying over the island in a stealth helicopter, equipped with advanced surveillance systems that allowed them to monitor the situation from a safe distance. As they approached the island, they noticed that the strange events appeared to be centered around a remote area, which was home to an abandoned research facility. They decided to focus their attention on this location, hoping to uncover clues about what was causing the mysterious events. As they explored the facility, they discovered that it had once been used to study kaiju and their incredible powers. Piecing together the information they found, they realized that the facility had been running experiments on a captured kaiju, hoping to harness its energy for military purposes. However, it seemed that the experiment had gone awry, and the kaiju had escaped, wreaking havoc on the island. Knowing the stakes had just been raised, the team decided to press on in their mission to stop the kaiju, even though they knew they were not fully prepared to battle such a powerful foe. They tracked the creature to a densely forested area of the island, where they found evidence of its destructive path. Realizing that the kaiju was growing increasingly dangerous, Traiven and Shawn began to devise a plan to stop the creature before it could cause any more harm. With Joker's help, they pieced together a plan that involved using the island's terrain and their own expert combat skills to their advantage, in hopes of capturing and neutralizing the kaiju. The intense battle that ensued tested the limits of their abilities, as Traiven, Shawn, and Joker fought the kaiju with every ounce of strength and skill they possessed. Despite the odds being stacked against them, they persevered, relying on their training and teamwork to gradually weaken the kaiju. Finally, after a grueling struggle, the team managed to subdue the creature and neutralize the threat it posed. Exhausted but victorious, Traiven, Shawn, and Joker contacted General Shinnle to report the successful completion of their mission. The experience had proved to them that, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges, they were capable of overcoming obstacles and achieving their objectives. General Shinnle praised the trio for their bravery and resourcefulness, and expressed his gratitude for their efforts in preventing further harm to innocent lives. In the aftermath of the mission, the team continued to hone their skills and took on new challenges, knowing that they would always be stronger together.

On his profile, Daniel said that he was from Melbourne, with the personal description that he was 'extremely unlucky in love and not your average guy.' Daniel, who uses the account names dja86dj and daniel86dja, has since deleted the offending OKCupid account. In all of the proposals towards Melbourne based women, Daniel offered 500 then raised the sum to 1000 then 2000. One of the women said he had been messaging her intermittently from different accounts for years. However, none of the women who were messaged by Daniel reported him to police. Daniel is seen urging the women to consider his offer of money for sex. Daniel, who uses the account names dja86dj and daniel86dja, has since deleted the offending OKCupid account. A police spokesperson said that no offence had been committed in the messages: in Australia, it is legal to offer money for sex. Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of feminism and prostitution at Melbourne University, told The Age laws should be tightened up on dating sites. 'Women are in no position to know whether men who they have never met are going to be dangerous to them or not,' she told The Age. She said Daniel's messages would have been deemed illegal in Ireland, Canada, Sweden and Norway, where it is unlawful to offer money for sex. OKCupid is owned by the same US company which runs Tinder, Match.com,and Collegehumour. In March, a 65-year-old New York man sued the OKCupid after he was swindled out of 70,000 by a man he met on the site. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A 28-year-old man named Daniel from Melbourne has sparked concern after offering women money for sex on the dating site OKCupid. Using different accounts, Daniel messaged several women and enquired if they had ever been offered money, subsequently naming prices and urging them to consider his proposition. Although his actions were not reported to the police, as offering money for sex is not illegal in Australia, his messaging has raised concerns about the safety of users on dating sites. Daniel's profile described him as \\"extremely unlucky in love and not your average guy.\\" In his proposals to Melbourne-based women, he initially offered 500 for sex, before raising the amount to 1,000 and later 2,000. One woman reported that he had been messaging her sporadically from different accounts over the years. This incident has led to calls for tighter regulations on dating sites. Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of feminism and prostitution at Melbourne University, argued that women cannot know whether unknown men messaging them might pose a risk. Prof. Jeffreys noted that offering money for sex is illegal in Ireland, Canada, Sweden, and Norway. She called for similar legislation to be implemented in Australia. OKCupid, owned by the same US company that runs Tinder, Match.com, and Collegehumor, has also courted negative attention in the past. In March, a 65-year-old man from New York sued the site after losing 70,000 to a scammer he met through the platform."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the worst relationship you've ever been in?","completion":"No, the following two questions are not the same, although they may appear to be related to similar aspects of personal experiences. Let's examine each question more closely to understand the differences between them: 1. What was the worst date you've ever been on? This question is specifically asking about a particular date or a single meeting between two people who are exploring or pursuing a romantic or a potential romantic connection. A date generally represents a chance for two individuals to get to know each other better, engage in a shared activity, or spend time together in order to determine whether there might be compatibility for a potential deeper relationship. Dates usually involve one-off events or experiences that can potentially leave positive or negative impressions. People may have several bad dates over time, as the dating process is often about trial and error to find the right partner. In this context, the question is asking for the worst experience someone has encountered during a single date. Factors determining a \\"worst\\" date could include mismatches in personalities, unmet expectations, offensive or inappropriate behaviors, lack of chemistry, a boring or awkward conversation, or an unsatisfactory activity or location for the date. When answering this question, someone may recount an anecdote or story that describes the particular circumstances or events that led to their categorization of the date as the \\"worst.\\" 2. What is the worst relationship you've ever been in? A relationship consists of an ongoing romantic, emotional, or intimate connection between two people. Relationships occur when two individuals develop a mutual bond beyond an initial date or meeting and both parties agree to engage in a deeper partnership, investing time, energy, and emotions into nurturing and maintaining the bond. Relationships can last weeks, months, or years, and can involve varying levels of commitment and emotional investment. When asking about the worst relationship someone has ever been in, the question delves into a broader scope of personal experiences, considering the overall quality and duration of a partnership. Factors that contribute to a \\"worst\\" relationship can be numerous and multifaceted, potentially including communication issues, incompatibility, negativity, lack of trust, dishonesty, infidelity, abuse (emotional or physical), or simply a decline in emotional connection over time. Answering this question, individuals would reflect on their past relationships and choose the one that had the most negative impact on their overall well-being or happiness, possibly sharing specific situations or patterns that occurred within that partnership. In conclusion, while both of these questions pertain to romantic experiences, they differ significantly in scope and context. The first question focuses on a singular, isolated event (a specific date), while the second question involves a broad evaluation of an entire relationship. Both questions solicit personal stories or experiences; however, they prompt different aspects of one's romantic history to be examined and shared."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea. But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

En français, la phrase ci-dessus est rendue de la manière suivante : Daté au bureau du Ministre, ce 17ème jour de mars 2004. Lors de la traduction d'une date en français depuis l'anglais, il est important de garder à l'esprit les différences de format entre les deux langues. Dans l'exemple donné, l'anglais utilise « 17th day of March » pour représenter le jour, tandis que le français utilise généralement une forme plus simple en utilisant simplement le numéro du jour suivi du mois, comme dans « 17 mars ». Cependant, pour une traduction plus littérale, on peut dire « 17ème jour de mars ». Il est également important de noter que les mois en français sont généralement écrits en minuscules, alors qu'en anglais, ils sont souvent écrits avec une majuscule initiale. Ainsi, il convient d'écrire « mars » avec une minuscule en français. En outre, considérez que la préposition « de » est utilisée en français pour indiquer l'année, et non « of » comme en anglais. Par conséquent, la traduction correcte serait « 17ème jour de mars 2004 ».

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. As the distance between the objects increases the magnetic force of attraction decreases. When you hold two magnets far away what is the force between them Strong or Weak? Answer:","completion":"As the distance between the objects increases, the magnetic force of attraction between them decreases. This phenomenon is governed by the inverse square law, which implies that the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it can be represented as: F = (k * |m1 * m2|) / d^2 Where: - F represents the magnetic force between the two magnets - k is a constant of proportionality - m1 and m2 are the magnitudes of the magnetic moments of the two magnets - d is the distance between the magnets When you hold two magnets far away from each other, the distance (d) between them becomes relatively large. As the distance in the denominator increases, the overall force F decreases according to the inverse square law. This means that as the distance between the two magnets increases, the magnetic force of attraction between them becomes weaker. Therefore, when you hold two magnets far away from each other, the force between them is weak. This weak force might not be enough to produce any noticeable attraction or effect, especially in the presence of external influences such as gravity, friction, or other nearby magnetic sources. However, as you bring the two magnets closer to each other, the magnetic force between them will increase and become significantly stronger, leading to a much more noticeable attraction or repulsion between the magnets, depending on their orientation. In summary, the magnetic force between two magnets is dependent on the distance between them, with the force becoming weaker as the distance increases. Consequently, when holding two magnets far away from each other, the force between them is weak."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Stockings are smaller than a tissue. Let's analyze the statements step-by-step and justify the steps: Step 1: Assessing the size comparison provided in the statements. - The statement [1] compares the size of stockings to a computer. Generally, it is true that stockings are smaller than most computers. - The statement [2] compares the size of stockings to a tissue. This comparison is inconsistent - as tissues, when unfolded or folded, are smaller than or could be similar to the size of stockings; they are not larger than stockings. Step 2: Determine which statement is more relevant to the goal. - Since the goal is to obtain stockings, a comparison of sizes with a tissue or a computer doesn't necessarily help accomplish this goal. However, understanding the size of stockings can be important when it comes to storage, fitting, or organizing them with other items. Step 3: Choose the statement that makes more sense for the given goal. - Considering the analysis in step 1 and step 2, statement [1] makes more sense because the size comparison is more accurate.

Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area. - Mek We Dweet is a studio album by Jamaican reggae singer Burning Spear . It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991 . - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Winston Rodney OD (born 1 March 1945), better known by the stage name Burning Spear, is a Jamaican roots reggae singer and musician. Burning Spear is a Rastafarian and one of the most influential and long-standing roots artists to emerge from the 1970s. - Mento is a style of Jamaican folk music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as acoustic guitar, banjo, hand drums, and the rhumba box a large mbira in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the bass part of the music. - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: When did the narrator start her self-portrait? Options: A. not enough information B.

UPDATED:. 08:06 EST, 31 October 2012. A motorcyclist badly injured in a crash had to be driven to hospital by his brother after ambulances sent to get him were diverted nine times. David Pinion, 24, lay in agony for 90 minutes after suffering extensive internal bruising in the crash as a paramedic at the scene desperately tried to organise an ambulance. But the paramedic was eventually told that the ambulances en route had to be diverted to 'more serious' incidents nine times and it would be best if the patient made his own way to the hospital. Crash scene: David Pinion, 24, lying at the side of road underneath. blankets while his brother tries to help him up to take him to the. hospital. It is unclear how many ambulances had been dispatched. Mr Pinion, whose waist had ballooned from 42in to 48in because of the swelling, was forced to ask the paramedic to call his brother to pick him up from the scene of the accident in Ely, Cambridge on October 14. The injured biker then had to be lifted off the road by his brother Robert and friend Chris Boon who drove him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Mr Pinion also suffered damage to his pelvis and ankle and was given morphine by hospital staff to ease his pain. Mr Pinion, from Prickwillow, Cambridge,said: 'The rapid response paramedic who got to me first was brilliant. 'She couldn't have done any more for me, but the people on the radio said they couldn't get an ambulance to me. 'They kept diverting them to more incidents because I was deemed not serious enough. 'Busy time': Ambulances sent to the scene were diverted nine times to 'more serious' incidents. 'The paramedic was arguing with them and. telling them I could have been bleeding internally but they just said. they were sorry and there was nothing they could do. 'Fortunately I didn't suffer any broken bones but I was in so much pain that I really wouldn't want to know what a broken bone feels like.' But Mr Pinion's angry family called for improvements to the ambulance service before lives are lost by delayed response times. Mr Pinion's mother Vanessa said: 'Does someone have to die before we have a decent, reliable ambulance service with a reasonable response time?' An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'This incident has already been raised by the Trust for investigation because the wait for transport to hospital was not acceptable. 'The patient was assessed on-scene by a paramedic, who arrived within six minutes, as not being in a life-threatening condition and during this exceptionally busy time all ambulances which became available had to be diverted to life-threatening calls.' Highlights:","completion":"- Motorcyclist David Pinion was badly hurt in a crash. - He waited 90 minutes, but ambulances were all busy. - David's brother drove him to the hospital instead. - David's family wants better ambulance services."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does \\"division\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? Magnolias belong to the division Magnoliophyta. The BBC's engineering division.","completion":"No, the word \\"division\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. The term is used to portray different concepts in both contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Magnolias belong to the division Magnoliophyta,\\" the term \\"division\\" is used in a biological or taxonomical context. In biology, division refers to a rank or category in the classification hierarchy, especially in the classification of plants and fungi. In this classification system, divisions are often considered equivalent to phyla in the animal kingdom. The division Magnoliophyta includes all flowering plants, and magnolias are members of this group. The purpose of this sentence is to inform the reader about the position of magnolias within the hierarchy of the biological classification system. In the second sentence, \\"The BBC's engineering division,\\" the term \\"division\\" refers to an organizational structure within a company or institution. Within the context of a business or corporation, a division is a distinct unit or section that operates semi-autonomously within the larger organization. Divisions typically have specific responsibilities, functions, or areas of expertise, and they serve to streamline the operation of the company or entity. In this sentence, the engineering division of the BBC would be responsible for tasks related to the maintenance, development, and optimization of engineering and technical infrastructures that support the broadcasting network. In summary, the term \\"division\\" has different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence, it refers to a classification rank in the biological taxonomy, whereas in the second sentence, it denotes an organizational unit within a company or institution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device When his side lost so meekly in Slovakia last month, the sense was that Strachan would recognise that the relationship between him and his players had run its course. Scotland performed with more gusto against England last week and it is clear that the players who are selected in the squads are still committed to the manager. But, by his own admission, they are all delivering 100% in every training session and game - yet the results have still been poor. How then could Strachan turn the team's fortunes around? It was that realisation that led to the view that he would surely stand down or be dismissed, an outcome that sections of the support would have welcomed. Sacking him would have cost the Scottish FA in compensation, when the qualifying campaign is already approaching a lost cause, but its board did not take that decision. Instead, Strachan has to turn around the team's form when they next play in March - and also public opinion. The head coach is now under more pressure than ever. He insists he can still steer Scotland to a World Cup qualifying play-off spot. To do that, his side need to finish second in Group F, with a better points tally (with games against the bottom side discounted) than the runners-up in at least one other group, since only eight of the nine second-placed teams will contest the play-offs. Group E is bottom in the runners-up rankings as it stands, but even reaching second place requires a drastic turnaround in Scotland's fortunes. They have won only one of their opening four games, against Malta, and drawn their home tie against Lithuania. Trips to Slovakia and England delivered two 3-0 losses. The simplest route to second place lies in making the assumption that England win all of their remaining qualifying games, which would repeat their 100% record in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. If Scotland win all of their five remaining games, they will finish on 19 points. If Slovenia lose to England and both games against Scotland, their best points tally would be 17. Assuming the same for Slovakia, their best points tally would be 18. There are other permutations. Slovenia travel to Slovakia in September and if that game is drawn then Scotland could finish second with 17 points, which would require four wins and one draw. In those circumstances, Scotland could potentially make the play-offs by beating Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia at Hampden, winning in Lithuania away and getting a point in Slovenia. Whatever happens, Scotland need to address their own decline first. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Scotland's national football team faces an uphill battle to secure a World Cup qualifying play-off spot after a poor start to their campaign. The team has won only one of its first four games and lies fifth in Group F, raising doubts over coach Gordon Strachan's tenure. To qualify for the play-offs, Scotland must finish second in their group and achieve a better points tally than at least one other second-place team. With five games left to play, beginning in March, the team needs drastic improvements in form to regain momentum and public support."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Question: According to the passage, what are some limitations and criticisms of humanism, and why does Tony Davies argue that it should not be entirely abandoned? Answer: The limitations and criticisms of humanism include its failure to fulfill its emancipatory ideal, highlighted by antihumanists, and controversial views like Heidegger's, who considered humanism only applicable to the Germans and specifically to the Nazis. Tony Davies argues that humanism should not be entirely abandoned because it remains the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution, and provides the freedom to speak, write, organize, and campaign for individual or collective interests."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Combine facts and answer this: Who wrote the Salford-set 1999 British comedy starring Om Puri that rose to popularity along with Anita and Me? Answer:","completion":"The Salford-set 1999 British comedy film starring Om Puri is \\"East is East,\\" which was written by Ayub Khan-Din. \\"East is East\\" is a film adaptation of Khan-Din's critically acclaimed semi-autobiographical play of the same name that premiered in 1996. The story revolves around the Khan family of mixed Pakistani-English ethnicity, living in Manchester, England, in the early 1970s, and the cultural struggles they face. Om Puri, renowned Indian actor, plays the role of George Khan, a Pakistani immigrant still deeply rooted in his traditional values, attempting to raise and enforce his beliefs upon his British-born children. The film brilliantly presents the conflicts the Khan family faces, especially the children, as they try to navigate their lives, torn between two very different cultures. The success of \\"East is East\\" allowed it to reach greater audiences and received several awards and nominations. This popularity eventually spawned a sequel titled \\"West Is West\\" in 2010, continuing the story of the Khan family. \\"Anita and Me\\", on the other hand, is a separate British comedy-drama film released in 2002, based on the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Meera Syal. The story is set in the Midlands during the 1970s and focuses on the coming-of-age experiences of a young British Asian girl named Meena, portrayed by Chandeep Uppal, and her friendship with a neighboring white girl, Anita, played by Anna Brewster. Both \\"East is East\\" and \\"Anita and Me\\" gained popularity due to their nuanced portrayal of the immigrant experience and British Asian identity. They both highlight the complexities of living between two cultures and the challenges faced by the characters as they navigate the cultural divide.

In this context, it can be inferred that the researchers have been diligent in their efforts to provide a comprehensive and cohesive account of their research. The premise states that the researchers provide a great deal of detail and description, which means they were thorough in documenting and presenting their findings. Furthermore, the researchers were attentive in quoting directly from the participants' own words as well as vignettes in the observers' field records. This demonstrates the researchers' commitment to accuracy and authenticity in their presentation of the information, thereby ensuring a complete and coherent narrative. However, it is important to consider that a person's perception of \\"difficult to read\\" may vary. In this case, comprehensiveness and cohesiveness in the research might make the text denser and may require more effort to understand the information. This added complexity could make the text less accessible for some readers, especially those who are not familiar with the research topic or methodology.

News article: Chelsea Manning: what kind of treatment can she expect in jail? 'I want everyone to know the real me' … Chelsea Manning. Photograph: Ho/AFP/Getty Images In July last year a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence for sexual offences was found hanged at Full Sutton, a maximum security men's jail near York. In the months leading up to the hanging, William \\"Billie\\" Evans had been wearing women's clothing and makeup as he became she. Evans was in the process of transitioning into a woman when she died. An inquest has not yet been held into the 44-year-old's death, though a prisoner at the jail told the Guardian she had been subjected to intense bullying and had been moved to a supposedly safer wing of the jail when she was found hanging in her single cell. But we don't need a coroner to confirm that male prisons are pretty macho places, where bullying is rife. Gyms are the most popular recreational facility, and are usually packed with inmates bent on bulking up their already honed torsos. For gay men, prison presents a challenge: abuse is commonplace, and gay men usually develop a thick skin and a readiness to meet mockery head-on. But those trapped in the wrong gender and undergoing change face an entirely different order of challenge. After Bradley Manning was jailed for 35 years this week for leaking a cache of US government secrets, his lawyer, David Coombs, announced that his client wished to be called Chelsea Manning and addressed with the female pronoun. Coombs said Manning was seeking hormone therapy and not a sex-change operation. Some jurisdictions in the US now require facilities to provide hormone therapy to trans inmates as a part of their routine medical care, but Fort Leavenworth, the military installation where Manning is being held, is not currently compelled to do the same. Officials there have made it clear that they will not be providing the required treatment, beyond psychiatric support. No inmates have received sex-reassignment surgery while in US prisons, Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project for Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, told NBC News this week. But a 2010 study by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation identified more than 330 transgender inmates in a population of about 160,000, equal to about 0.2%. The National Center for Transgender Equality in the US estimates that the actual figure may be much higher. The prison service in England and Wales says it does not collate figures of transgender prisoners nationally, with a spokeswoman saying simply that \\"prison staff are required to manage transgendered prisoners in accordance with the law\\". The Scottish Prison Service (SPS), which has a more enlightened policy on trans issues, confirms that in the past year, five prisoners who presented as male when entering the prison system ended up in women's jails, with seven women doing the reverse and ending up in male jails. Currently the Scottish prison population stands at 8,292, (compared with 88,179 in England and Wales), so that is 0.14%. In Scotland transgender inmates are identified as soon as they go to jail, says Tom Fox, head of corporate affairs at the SPS. \\"In all cases, a risk assessment is conducted on arrival at the prison. Thereafter, a multidisciplinary case conference is carried out as soon as possible, [which] will decide on the management of that person. The SPS is developing a policy on gender identity and gender reassignment. Interim guidance developed in conjunction with relevant partners has been issued to staff. The guidance and policy is being developed in partnership with the Transgender Alliance and our legal partners.\\" He is unsure whether any inmates have undergone surgery, but said that the SPS would permit it. Ever since the Gender Recognition Act 2004 came into force, prisons in England and Wales have been forced to accommodate the needs of trans inmates who have received legal acknowledgement of their acquired gender through the issue of a gender recognition certificate. A special prison service order deals with the issue of gender-change prisoners and provides guidance for prison managers and staff. Its main tenet declares establishments must provide prisoners who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria with the same quality of care they would expect to receive from the NHS if they had not been sent to prison. Jails are instructed to permit prisoners undergoing gender reassignment to live permanently in their acquired gender. This includes dressing in appropriate clothing, adopting new names and form of address. The rules differ according to gender; males wishing to transition to females may be refused permission to transfer to a female prison on grounds of security, but female-to-male prisoners may not be refused a transfer, because there are no grounds that can prevent location in the male estate. The position was clarified in a high court judgment in 2009. A pre-operative transgender prisoner at HMP Manchester (formerly Strangeways) asked for a judicial review after being refused a transfer to a female prison on security grounds. The judge, David Elvin QC, ruled that the decision contravened Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered that the claimant be transferred to a female jail. Experts for the prison service and the claimant successfully argued that the Gender Identity Clinic in London would not approve surgery until she had spent a period living as a woman in a female jail. It followed that as long as she remained in the male estate, she was unable to progress towards surgery. \\"The prison service seems to have confused attitudes,\\" the claimant said in evidence. \\"They will not consider me as a female until I have my penis removed, notwithstanding my gender recognition certificate. Yet they resist moving me to the female estate, which would enable me to have the surgery.\\" The 27-year-old said she had been trying to \\"get this sorted\\" since she was 10. \\"It is frustrating not to be able to progress to the final stage, and I worry it may never happen. I get frustrated, but I try to deal with it on my own. I do cry and let my emotions out, but I do this in the privacy of my cell. It is not something I can discuss with anyone in prison.\\" As for what will happen to Manning, it is far from clear. LGBT groups in the US declare the military's refusal to provide hormone therapy unconstitutional. But change could be on the horizon. Last year a US judge ruled that the State Department of Correction must provide sex-reassignment surgery for Michelle Kosilek, who is serving a life sentence for murder. Massachusetts prison officials have asked a federal appeals court to overturn the ruling. If Kosilek wins, Manning may be able to expect more compassionate treatment, too.

All Indian religions assert it to be a state of perfect quietude, freedom, highest happiness along with it being the liberation from \\"samsara\\", the repeating cycle of birth, life and death. - \\"Learn to Fly\\" is the first single from the Foo Fighters' third album \\"There Is Nothing Left to Lose\\", released in 1999. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - The Grammy Award for Best Rock Song is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality songs in the rock music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \\"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\\". - Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. - There Is Nothing Left to Lose is the third studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released November 2, 1999. The album marks the first appearance of drummer Taylor Hawkins, and is often seen as a departure from the band's previous work, showcasing a softer, more experimental sound. In a 2006 interview, Dave Grohl states that the album is \\"totally based on melody\\" and that it \\"might be his favorite album that they've ever done.\\" - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 April 5, 1994) was an American musician, artist, songwriter, guitarist and poet. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene and grunge genre. Nirvana's debut album \\"Bleach\\" was released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. - \\"Best of You\\" is a song by American alternative rock band Foo Fighters, and the first single released from the band's fifth studio album, \\"In Your Honor\\" (2005). Dave Grohl notes that the song was written following appearances at 2004 American presidential candidate John Kerry's campaign trail and is \\"about breaking away from the things that confine you\\". To date, it is the band's only single to reach Platinum status in the US. The song holds the band's highest chart peaks in the U.S. (#18), the UK (#4), and Australia (#5), and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song won the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. It also topped \\"Billboard\\"'s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for seven weeks. Following the band's performance at Live Earth, the song again entered the UK charts at #38. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - \`\` The Pretender '' is a song by the American alternative rock band Foo Fighters . It was the first single from the group 's 2007 album Echoes , Silence , Patience & Grace .

It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. - Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Kerrang! is a UK-based magazine devoted to rock music, currently published by Hamburg based Bauer Media Group. It was first published on 6 June 1981 as a one-off supplement in the \\"Sounds\\" newspaper. Named after the onomatopoeic word that derives from the sound made when playing a power chord on a distorted electric guitar, \\"Kerrang!\\" was initially devoted to the new wave of British heavy metal and the rise of hard rock acts. In the early 2000s it became the best-selling British music newspaper. 'the pretender ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'record label'?

Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development.

The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\".

Katrina offered her some pain pills.","completion":"Monica knew that Katrina was having cramps because she was on her period, so Monica offered her some pain pills. She could not stand to see her friend in pain and felt that it was important to provide some kind of relief. Monica remembered how terrible it felt when she herself experienced cramps during her period and understood the uneasiness Katrina was going through. In that moment, she made a judgement call to help her friend feel better. Their friendship had always been one of understanding and support, and this occasion was no different. Monica thought about the times when they had been there for each other through thick and thin, during happy moments and difficult ones. She knew that, at times like this, it was essential to stand by her friend and make her feel comfortable. She approached Katrina with a kind and gentle smile, trying to gauge her level of discomfort and assess if she was in unbearable pain. Monica carefully handed her a bottle of over-the-counter pain relief medication, explaining that these pills had helped her through many similar situations. She trusted that this simple gesture would alleviate Katrina's discomfort, at least for the time being. Katrina, though initially hesitant to accept the pills due to a moment of pride, soon realized that she could use some help. She felt grateful for Monica's understanding and concern and took the pills with a warm \\"Thank you.\\" As they sat together, waiting for the medicine to take effect, they found solace in each other's company and in the reminder that they were there to support one another. In that moment, what started as a small act of kindness turned into a bonding experience. The girls engaged in light conversation, and Monica made sure to avoid any topic that could stress Katrina further. Periods are a natural and normal part of life for many women, but are often associated with pain and discomfort. Monica's concern and care helped make an uncomfortable situation more manageable for her friend. As time passed and the pain began to subside, Katrina felt grateful not only for the relief that the pain pills had provided, but also for the love and compassion Monica had shown her. Their friendship, built on trust, understanding, and loyalty, had been further enriched by this simple yet meaningful gesture. In conclusion, Monica offered her friend Katrina pain pills because she empathized with Katrina's painful experience caused by menstrual cramps. This small act of kindness served as a reminder of the strength of their friendship and the importance of being there for the people we care about."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: If you're about to reach a stop sign in your car what must you do? Possible A: slow down, go fast, roll over, crash, fly Why is \\"slow down\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Slow down\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Common sense, as a general concept, refers to the innate, practical knowledge that humans possess which allows them to make logical judgments and decisions in a variety of situations. In the context of driving, common sense plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and well-being of all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists. 1. Traffic regulations: One of the primary reasons \\"slow down\\" is aligned with common sense is due to traffic regulations. Stop signs are a standard traffic control device installed to inform drivers that they are required to make a complete stop at a specific point, usually at an intersection. Adhering to traffic rules and regulations promotes order and predictability on the road, making the act of slowing down when approaching a stop sign a common sense action. 2. Safety: Another crucial aspect of common sense is prioritizing safety. Slowing down when approaching a stop sign is the safest course of action to prevent accidents or collisions with other road users. Coming to a complete stop allows the driver to assess the situation, check for cross traffic or pedestrians, and proceed only when it is safe to do so. Adopting a common sense approach and slowing down at stop signs contributes to overall road safety. 3. Responsibility: As a responsible driver, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and hazards on the road. Failing to slow down at a stop sign can lead to accidents, penalties, or legal consequences. As a sign of respect for fellow road users and a commitment to adhering to the rules of the road, slowing down at a stop sign demonstrates responsible behavior informed by common sense. 4. Collision avoidance: As a driver, one of the fundamental common sense principles is to avoid potential collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Slowing down when approaching a stop sign ensures that the driver has sufficient time to react, assess the situation, and avoid any potential dangers. In contrast to the other possible answers provided, such as \\"go fast,\\" \\"roll over,\\" \\"crash,\\" and \\"fly,\\" \\"slow down\\" is the clear choice based on common sense. These alternative responses do not contribute to good decision-making, as they either defy the laws of physics, like \\"fly,\\" or actively encourage behavior that would significantly increase the risk of harm, like \\"go fast,\\" \\"roll over,\\" or \\"crash.\\" In summary, \\"slow down\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it adheres to traffic regulations, promotes safety, demonstrates responsibility, and helps avoid collisions. Choosing to slow down when approaching a stop sign not only prevents accidents but also fosters a safer and more predictable driving environment for all road users."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the condition (ABC is not busy being part of the problem) were met, the result (it would have been a good story for ABC News) would happen. The hypothesis is also a counterfactual conditional statement. If the condition (ABC news had not incited the terrorist) were met, the result (there would have been no story) would happen. Step 3: Check for entailment with the given counterfactual conditionals An entailment exists if the truth of one statement (A) guarantees the truth of another statement (B). In this case, the truth of the premise would need to guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Now let's examine the premise and hypothesis. The premise states that if ABC News wasn't part of the problem, then it would have been a good story for them. The hypothesis states that if ABC News hadn't incited the terrorist, there would have been no story. Step 4: Assess if the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis The conditions of the premise and the hypothesis are different (being part of the problem vs. inciting the terrorist), so it's unclear if one guarantees the truth of the other. Also, the outcome in the premise (a good story for ABC News) is not the same as the outcome in the hypothesis (no story at all), which indicates that these statements don't entail each other. Conclusion: The given premise does not entail the given hypothesis. While there may be some relationship between ABC News being part of the problem and inciting the terrorist, the information given doesn't allow us to determine that one statement guarantees the truth of the other."},{"prompt":"Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Sic.

Lewis Robert \\"Hack\\" Wilson (April 26, 1900 - November 23, 1948) was an American Major League Baseball player who played 12 seasons for the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark yet to be surpassed. \\" Wilson made his major league debut with the Giants on September 29, 1923 and became the starting left fielder the following season. By mid-July he was ranked second in the National League (NL) in hitting. He ended the season with a .295 average, 10 home runs, and 57 runs batted in (RBIs) as New York won the NL pennant. In the 1924 World Series he averaged only .233 in a seven-game loss to the Washington Senators. Multiple stories exist to explain the origin of Wilson's nickname: By one account, a New York newspaper held a nicknaming contest; the winning entry was \\"Hack\\" because he reminded many fans of another stocky athlete, the popular wrestler Georg Hackenschmidt. In another version, McGraw is said to have remarked that Wilson's physique was reminiscent of a \\"hack\\" (slang for taxicab in that era). Giants teammate Bill Cunningham claimed that the nickname was based on Wilson's resemblance to Hack Miller, an outfielder with the Chicago Cubs. The New York Times printed the first documented usage of \\"Hack\\" on June 10, 1924. Early in the 1925 season Wilson hit the longest home run on record at Ebbets Field against the Brooklyn Robins, but fell into a slump in May, and was replaced in left field by Irish Meusel. On July 2 he hit two home runs in one inning, tying Ken Williams' major league record set in 1922, but his hitting slump continued. In August McGraw told reporters that he had \\"...made the mistake of rushing [Wilson] along,\\" and sent him to the Giants' minor league affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. At season's end, a front office oversight--or possibly, deliberate inaction--left him unprotected on the Toledo roster, and the last-place Chicago Cubs acquired him on waivers. \\"They let go the best outfielder I ever played alongside\\", said Giants right fielder Ross Youngs, \\"and they're going to regret it.\\" During the 1925 World Series -- between the Senators and the Pittsburgh Pirates -- Wilson's son, Robert, was born. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article and Hack Wilson's life and career: 1. Hack Wilson's physical attributes: Standing at only 5 feet 6 inches and weighing around 190 pounds, Wilson's powerful build and short legs were unusual for an outfielder. However, his large arms, broad shoulders, and powerful upper body allowed him to generate an impressive amount of power for his size, which contributed to his success as a hitter. 2. Record-breaking 1930 season with the Cubs: Wilson had a phenomenal season in 1930, posting incredible numbers that still hold significance in baseball history. He hit 56 home runs, which remained the National League record until 1998 when it was surpassed by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. More notably, Wilson set the all-time MLB record for runs batted in (RBIs) with 191, a record that still stands today. 3. Alcoholism and personal struggles: Hack Wilson's life was not without its challenges, as he battled alcoholism throughout his career and life. His drinking led to issues with management, and he was even traded several times due to this behavior. Sadly, his addiction ultimately led to a downward spiral in his career and contributed to his early death at the age of 48. 4. Post-career and Hall of Fame induction: Wilson's post-baseball life was marked by financial struggles, failed business endeavors, and alcoholism. However, his remarkable career was finally recognized when he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979, more than 30 years after his death. 5. Legacy: Despite his tumultuous personal life, Wilson's outstanding baseball accomplishments still make him a notable figure in the sport's history. He was known for his powerful swing and ability to hit the ball out of the park, as well as for his unforgettable record-setting 1930 season. Hack Wilson's legacy serves as both a testament to his incredible talent and a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of personal struggles, such as substance abuse, in the lives of professional athletes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The quiet and gentle 25-year-old was on the verge of starting a new career in Information Technology (IT) when his life was tragically cut short due to the senseless act of violence. An unfortunate chain of events led to Thavisha's untimely demise. He was working his last shift at his part-time job and was about to clock off. However, he was persuaded to take one final delivery before finishing his day. Little did he know that this seemingly innocuous decision would result in an appalling and life-changing encounter. While on his last delivery, Thavisha was brutally attacked for his phone, a motive which highlights the tragic prevalence of crime and violence dominating today's society. Thavisha, a hard-working, ambitious, and gentle young man, had moved from Sri Lanka to pursue a promising career in the IT industry. His life and the hopes of his family were shattered when the defendants, Shamraze Khan and Kasim Ahmed, callously targeted him. During the court proceedings, it was revealed that Shamraze Khan had been charged with Thavisha's murder. On the other hand, Kasim Ahmed pleaded guilty to the heinous crime, accepting full responsibility for his appalling actions. Both defendants now face the specter of justice for their cold-blooded actions that ended an innocent young man's life. Thavisha's murder brings to light the harrowing dangers faced by individuals engaging in seemingly safe tasks, such as making deliveries for occupations that are traditionally viewed as low-risk. His death highlights the pressing need for greater safety measures for employees in these sectors, as well as a renewed focus on addressing crime and violence in our communities. The senseless murder of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris has sent ripples of shock and sorrow throughout the community. His family, friends, and colleagues are grappling with the traumatic reality of losing someone so young and full of potential.

As our society grapples with pervasive crime and violence, it is essential that we take meaningful action to implement strategies to curb these alarming trends. We need to invest in community-based initiatives, education, and law enforcement efforts to combat the root causes of crime and prevent needless acts of violence, like Thavisha's murder, from recurring. In conclusion, the immeasurable loss of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris serves as a stark reminder of the urgency to address the societal issues surrounding crime and violence. Moving forward, it is the responsibility of our communities and institutions to implement comprehensive action plans to prevent future tragedies such as this and to create a safer world where talented, hard-working individuals like Thavisha can realize their dreams and achieve their fullest potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them. Would trail B be shorter or longer than trail A? Hint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to... Answer:","completion":"In this scenario, it is likely that trail B would be longer than trail A. Since ants communicate using pheromones and are able to detect the shortest and most efficient route to a food source by reinforcing the pheromone trail, the trail with the most ants (trail A) would indicate that it is the most efficient path. When a food source is found, ants mark the trail on their way back to the colony, and other ants follow and reinforce this trail. As more ants use the trail, the pheromone scent becomes stronger, signaling to other ants that it is the optimal path. When the food source is exhausted, ants stop marking the route, allowing the scent to dissipate slowly. On the other hand, trail B was abandoned, suggesting that it was not the shortest or most efficient route to a food source. The ants would have explored other routes (including trail A) and determined that trail B was not the best option. Consequently, fewer ants marked and reinforced trail B, causing the pheromone scent to diminish and ants to stop using that trail."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this \\"Prepare your thread.\\"","completion":"Title: \\"Getting Your Thread Ready: A Simple Guide for Little Hands\\" Hello, boys and girls! Today, we're going to learn about preparing threads! Threads can be used for many things like sewing, making friendship bracelets, or even creating little projects with your family, like making decorations for your room. But first, we need to get our thread ready. Let's begin! 1. Choosing the Thread The first thing we have to do is choose the right thread. Let's think of this as picking your favorite flavor of ice-cream. Just like there are many flavors, there are many colors of thread. Pick a color that you love! 2. Measuring the Thread Now that you've picked your favorite color, it's time to measure how much thread we need. Ask a grown-up to help you with this part. Using a ruler, decide how long you want your thread to be and then ask your grown-up friend to cut it. Maybe the length you need is as long as your favorite toy or as short as the length of your hand. 3. Untangling the Thread Sometimes threads can get tangled, just like the shoelaces on your shoes. To untangle the thread, hold one end with your fingertips and use the other hand to gently brush the thread, just like you would with your hair. If it's too tangled, ask for help from a grown-up. 4. Threading the Needle Now let's get our needle ready for sewing or crafting! Carefully put one end of the thread through the needle's tiny hole called the \\"eye of the needle.\\" It might be a little tricky, but with practice, you can do it. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask a grown-up. Remember, needles can be sharp, so be very careful! 5. Tying a Knot To make sure our thread stays in place when we're sewing or making our craft, we need to knot the other end. Pinch some thread between your thumb and pointer finger, then twist it around your finger to make a loop. Next, take the end of the thread and push it through the loop, pull it tight, and voilà! You've got a knot! If you want it to be extra secure, you can make another knot on top of the first one. 6. Ready, Set, Create! Great job! Your thread is now all set and ready to use for sewing, making a craft, or creating a lovely piece of art. Have fun with your thread, and remember to always ask for help from a grown-up if you need it. Happy crafting!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, instead of a standard biographical drama, they want to incorporate action and stunts, making it an action-comedy biopic, the first of its kind. Mark and Paul are hired to play Peter and Bobby Farrelly respectively. Due to their physical build and stuntman background, they not only have to portray the personalities and comedic styles of the Farrelly Brothers but also perform rigorously complicated action sequences, turning the movie's making process into an action-packed journey itself.

V současné době je pro systémy RFID k dispozici několik kmitočtových pásem na bezlicenčním základě[11] a ve většině zemí EU již tomu tak je po mnoho let. Translate to English","completion":"At present, several frequency bands are available for RFID systems on an unlicensed basis[11], and this has been the case in most EU countries for many years. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has become increasingly popular in the last few years, primarily for its applications in supply chain management, logistics, and asset tracking. The RFID technology uses radio waves to wirelessly transmit the identity of an object, in the form of a unique serial number, from an RFID tag attached to the object to an RFID reader. Governments around the world regulate the frequency bands that can be used for RFID systems. In the case of the European Union (EU), several frequency bands are available for unlicensed RFID systems, meaning that companies and organizations can use these bands without obtaining a specific license. This convenient policy has made it easier for companies in the EU to adopt and implement RFID technologies. However, it is essential to understand that these unlicensed frequency bands are not exclusive to individual organizations. As a result, interference between various RFID systems using the same frequency may occur, which can potentially affect the performance of the systems involved. To ensure the smooth operation of RFID systems, it is crucial for companies to select frequencies that are suitable for their particular applications. Some key factors to consider include the range at which the RFID system needs to operate, the type of environment in which the RFID system will be used, and the specific materials that the RFID tags will be attached to. These factors can also help minimize potential interference with other RFID systems operating within the same frequency band. Having multiple frequency bands available on an unlicensed basis has facilitated the widespread adoption of RFID technology in the European Union. This has led to improved efficiency, asset management, and better tracking information for various industries, ultimately benefiting the European economy as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Rocky V Movie plot: Rocky V begins with Rocky and his trainer Tony \\"Duke\\" Evers in their dressing room after the Drago fight. Tony praises Rocky for his victory, but Rocky, seen to be in some form of physical discomfort, asks Tony to summon his wife, Adrian. His hands are shaking, and he cannot make them stop due to the trauma, pain and fear caused by Drago. In addition to that, he keeps calling for \\"Mick\\", the name of his deceased former trainer.Rocky returns home from the Soviet Union and is greeted by his son, Robert. At the following press conference, a crooked promoter named George Washington Duke (a parody of boxing promoter Don King) tries to goad Rocky into fighting the new #1 contender to his championship, Union Cane, in Tokyo. Duke sees this as a great opportunity with both Rocky's managers Mickey Goldmill and Apollo Creed dead. With Adrian insisting on her husband's retirement, Rocky decides, at least for the time being, not to take the fight with Cane.Rocky, Adrian, and Adrian's brother Paulie return to their lavish Philadelphia home to find out that Paulie had unknowingly signed 'power of attorney' over to Balboa's accountant, who had, in turn, squandered all of Rocky's money on bad business deals and fled the country with all of the Balboa estate money (it is also revealed the accountant had not paid Rocky's income taxes in six years). Now bankrupt, Rocky is forced to sell his house and auction all of his cars and belongings: the only thing Rocky does not lose is Mickey's gym, which Mickey had willed to Rocky's son (making it untouchable to the IRS). Rocky immediately decides to take the fight against Cane to earn money. However, years of fighting, especially the last one with Drago, have taken a toll on him and after a physical evaluation, it is determined that Rocky has suffered significant brain damage, and that he can no longer fight without further risking his health.

On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B. But I can use this background: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below.

Please answer a question about the following article about Seven Years%27 War: The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor. What country made gains in the Treaty of Hubertusburg?","completion":"The Treaty of Hubertusburg, signed on February 15, 1763, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, effectively restored the status quo of 1748. While no country gained new territories, it could be argued that Prussia emerged as a winner by maintaining and solidifying its gains from the past. In this treaty, Silesia and Glatz, which had been the main subjects of conflict during the Seven Years' War, were retained and reverted to Frederick of Prussia. Despite Austria's attempt to reclaim at least Glatz, Frederick did not allow it. Saxony was restored to its elector, with Prussia refusing to evacuate Saxony until the elector had renounced any claims to reparation. The only concession made by Prussia to Austria was agreeing to the election of Archduke Joseph as the Holy Roman Emperor. However, this did not lead to territorial gains or losses for Austria. In summary, although no country made significant territorial gains in the Treaty of Hubertusburg, Prussia managed to maintain and solidify its previously acquired territories, primarily Silesia and Glatz. This outcome enabled Prussia to establish itself as a European power and reinforced its influence in the region, especially against its rivals, Austria and Saxony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: college campus, players, high school, texas, oklahoma Why is \\"college campus\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"College campus\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense, because it takes into account various factors that contribute to the context and plausibility of the given scenario. Let us examine these factors in more depth to better understand why \\"college campus\\" is a sensible answer. 1. Large gatherings: Football games typically draw large crowds, with tens of thousands of people often attending high-profile matches. College campuses are known for hosting football games that attract massive numbers of fans, students, and alumni, creating a lively atmosphere in support of their teams. Therefore, when the question mentions \\"over a hundred thousand people at the football field that weekend,\\" it refers to a significant event that logically fits the scale of a popular college campus. 2. Popularity: The question refers to \\"the most popular spot,\\" suggesting a location well-known and frequented by people. College campuses often serve as cultural and social hubs in their respective communities, where various events - including football games - take place. A college football game typically generates significant interest among fans, making the college campus a popular spot for social gathering. 3. Competition: College football games are marked by intense rivalry between teams, leading to passionate displays from players, coaches, and fans alike. The mention of \\"the most popular spot\\" implies that there is a high level of enthusiasm for the game. College campuses epitomize the competitive spirit and camaraderie found in these events, making them ideal venues for such high-stakes matches. 4. Relevance: Among the possible answers, \\"college campus\\" is the most fitting context for the scenario described in the question. While \\"players\\" and \\"high school\\" also pertain to football, they lack the scale and fanbase necessary to accommodate a hundred thousand people. Meanwhile, \\"Texas\\" and \\"Oklahoma\\" are geographical locations that do not fully capture the essence of the scenario, which revolves around a specific venue with high popularity. Taking these factors into account, \\"college campus\\" emerges as the most appropriate answer due to its scale, popularity, and ability to offer the right context for the high-profile match described in the given scenario. Additionally, human common sense also considers the location where the scenario is likely to take place, which in this case, is a college campus known for hosting large football events that attract thousands of people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Process: - A star forms - The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star. suppose star is in a stable environment happens, how will it affect a SMALLER white dwarf star. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"In a stable environment where a star goes through the process described above and becomes a white dwarf star, the impact on a smaller white dwarf star nearby can be seen in different ways. First, let's analyze the specific scenario mentioned, and then for each of the following conditions, we'll determine whether the impact is direct, indirect, or non-existent. 1) Directly impacting a step of the process: White dwarfs are the compact remnants of low to intermediate-mass stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and shed their outer layers. A smaller white dwarf star in the vicinity of the described star may experience a direct impact in its evolution if it's part of a binary system, meaning it shares a common center of mass with the larger star. During the process of the larger star becoming a red giant and shedding its outer layers to form a nebula, the smaller white dwarf may accrete some of this material, leading to mass transfer between the stars. This can have a direct influence on the smaller white dwarf's properties such as its mass, temperature, and chemical composition, and may lead to an accelerated cooling process or even trigger a nova or supernova event if the mass transfer is significant. 2) Indirectly impacting a step of the process: An indirect impact on the smaller white dwarf star could be a result of the radiation and stellar wind from the larger star during its red giant phase. As the red giant loses mass and ejects its outer layers, the radiation and wind may potentially disturb the outer layers of the smaller white dwarf or even alter its orbit around the gravitational center of the binary system. This indirect influence may affect the small white dwarf star's long-term stability and can potentially change its physical characteristics over time. 3) Not impacting any step of the process: In some cases, the larger star's evolution might not have an observable impact on the smaller white dwarf star. This would be likely if the white dwarfs are not part of a close binary system or if they are located at a considerable distance from each other. In this scenario, the processes occurring in the larger star would not have a significant or observable effect on the smaller white dwarf. In conclusion, the perturbation on the smaller white dwarf star by the larger star's evolution process depends on the specific characteristics of their system, such as their masses, distances, and whether or not they are in a close binary system. The impacts can be direct, indirect, or non-existent depending on these factors and the specific stage of the larger star's evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Antarctica? What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Thar Desert?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They both inquire about the Sahara and ask for a comparison of temperatures, but they are referring to different regions with distinct climatic conditions. Let's analyze each question separately. 1. What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Antarctica? The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world, covering an area of approximately 9.2 million square kilometers (3.6 million square miles) in North Africa. It stretches across multiple countries, including Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Sudan, and Tunisia. The Sahara consists of different geographical features such as sand dunes, rocky plateaus, salt flats, and dry valleys. It has a predominantly arid and hot climate characterized by high temperatures and low precipitation. In contrast, Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it sits predominantly within the Antarctic Circle. It is the fifth largest continent, encompassing approximately 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles) of ice-covered landmass. The climate in Antarctica is extremely cold, dry, and characterized as a polar desert, with average temperatures much lower than any other continent on Earth. Comparing the average temperatures of both regions, the Sahara typically experiences high temperatures ranging between 20°C (68°F) at night and 45°C (113°F) during the day. In some of the hottest months, temperatures can exceed 50°C (122°F). On the other hand, average temperatures in Antarctica differ significantly based on the area and the season. Coastal areas have relatively milder temperatures that may range from -10°C (14°F) in summer to -30°C (-22°F) in winter. However, in the interior regions, temperatures average around -30°C (-22°F) in summer and plunge to -60°C (-76°F) during winter. The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in Antarctica, at -89.2°C (-128.6°F). Thus, this question seeks to understand the general climatic conditions in the Sahara and Antarctica regions and compare their average temperatures, which are vastly different. 2. What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Thar Desert? As described earlier, the Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world. It has arid and hot climatic conditions with high temperatures and low precipitation levels. The Thar Desert, also known as the Great Indian Desert, is a large arid region situated in northwest India and southeast Pakistan. Covering an area of approximately 200,000 square kilometers (77,000 square miles), it is the 18th largest subtropical desert globally. The Thar Desert has a predominantly arid climate, characterized by high temperatures, low precipitation, and varying terrain consisting of sand dunes, rocky hills, and barren plains. In terms of average temperatures, both the Sahara and Thar Desert experience hot and arid conditions. However, they differ in the extremities of their respective temperatures. As mentioned earlier, the Sahara typically experiences high temperatures of 20°C (68°F) at night and 45°C (113°F) during the day, with some months exceeding 50°C (122°F). In comparison, the Thar Desert has average temperatures ranging from 35°C to 42°C (95°F to 108°F) during the hot months of May and June. In winter, the average temperature drops to around 10°C (50°F) during the day and can get as low as 0°C (32°F) at night. In summary, this question seeks to compare the average temperatures of the Sahara and Thar Desert, two separate desert regions with distinct climatic conditions. While both deserts experience high temperatures and arid conditions, the Sahara's temperature range is generally more extreme than that of the Thar Desert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Q:Given the following context: Agrippina (HWV 6) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani. Composed for the 1709–10 Venice Carnevale season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \\"anti-heroic satirical comedy\\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI. Handel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century. In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who had an ongoing revival?

Poseidon, an ocean liner slated for retirement and scrapping, makes her way across the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea from New York City to Athens. Despite protests from Captain Harrison (Leslie Nielsen), who fears for the ship's safety, the representative of her new owners, Mr. Linarcos, insists that he should go at full speedâ26 or so knotsâtowards Athens to save money, preventing him from taking on additional ballast. The Reverend Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), a heretical minister believing God helps those who help themselves, delivers a sermon. Detective Lt. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and wife Linda (Stella Stevens), a sarcastic former prostitute, deal with her seasickness. Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) and younger brother Robin (Eric Shea) are traveling to meet their parents. Robin is interested in how the ship works and frequently visits the engine room. Retired Jewish hardware store owner Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) and wife Belle (Shelley Winters) are going to Israel to meet their two-year-old grandson for the first time. Haberdasher James Martin (Red Buttons) is a love-shy, health-conscious bachelor. The ship's singer, Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley), rehearses for the New Year's Day celebration with her band.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how latin america has changed us culture Suggested answer: Original elements also play a strong role, such as the invention of Jeffersonian democracy . Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"To accurately determine if the suggested answer is valid, it is essential to first understand the context of the question, which is exploring the influence of Latin America on US culture. We can then evaluate the answer referring to the invention of Jeffersonian democracy to determine if it is indeed relevant to the topic at hand. Jeffersonian democracy refers to the political philosophy and principles advocated by Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. It emphasizes agrarianism, republicanism, limited government, and states' rights, primarily promoting the concept of individual liberty. This form of democracy is distinctively American and has shaped the political development of the country. On the other hand, Latin America has had significant impacts on the US culture, particularly in areas such as language, music, cuisine, arts, and religion. The United States has experienced growing cultural exchanges and interactions with Latin American nations, with substantial immigration from countries like Mexico, Cuba, and Puerto Rico affecting the demographics and cultural landscape of the US. Latin music genres like salsa, tango, and reggaeton have gained popularity and have been integrated into mainstream music. The same is true for Latin-American cuisine, as dishes such as tacos, enchiladas, and ceviche are now commonly found in the American food scene. Furthermore, religious practices such as the Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Day of the Dead celebration also exemplify how Latin America has shaped US culture. In relation to the suggested answer mentioning the invention of Jeffersonian democracy, it is evident that this aspect of US history is not directly related to the influence of Latin America on US culture. While the concept of Jeffersonian democracy is an essential element in American political history, it does not accurately address the original question focusing on the changes in US culture attributable to Latin American influences. In light of this evaluation, I recommend not validating the suggested answer as it does not accurately address the topic of how Latin America has changed US culture. Instead, the answer should provide specific examples of Latin American influences on American language, music, cuisine, arts, and religion, which are more relevant to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...what part of iceland is in the arctic circle??","completion":"Iceland, an island nation in the North Atlantic, has a unique geographical location. The Arctic Circle, a line of latitude at 66°33'39\\" N, marks the southern boundary of the Arctic region. Most of Iceland lies below the Arctic Circle due to its latitude, which ranges between 63°23'05\\" N at the southernmost point and 66°32'00\\" N at its northernmost tip. However, a small portion of Iceland does fall within the Arctic Circle, predominantly the island of Grímsey. Grímsey is a remote island located approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the mainland of Iceland. It is the only part of the country that is truly within the Arctic Circle, as the line of latitude crosses the island. Grímsey measures about 5.3 square kilometers (2 square miles) in size, and its topography consists mainly of cliffs, coastal plains, and an extinct volcano, Basalt Hill. The island’s population is quite sparse, with only about 60 inhabitants. Since the Arctic Circle is not a static line and shifts slightly due to Earth's axial tilt and atmospheric refraction, Grímsey occasionally falls outside the Arctic region for short periods of time. Nevertheless, it remains the main portion of Iceland that is within the Arctic Circle. In addition to Grímsey, Iceland has several other islands and skerries located to its north, such as Kolbeinsey and Mánáreyjar. Some of these smaller landmasses are also near or within the Arctic Circle. However, these islands are uninhabited and have limited access due to their remote locations and challenging weather conditions. The parts of Iceland belonging to the Arctic Circle hold significance in terms of their natural and cultural heritage. Grímsey, for example, is home to a diverse array of bird species, such as puffins, auks, and kittiwakes, making it an appealing destination for birdwatching and eco-tourism. Moreover, the island provides visitors a unique opportunity to experience the Midnight Sun during summer, as well as the enchanting Northern Lights during winter, both of which are characteristic of the Arctic region. In conclusion, while most of Iceland lies below the Arctic Circle, the island of Grímsey and a few minor islands and skerries to Iceland's north are considered within the Arctic region. These locations offer their own distinct ecological, cultural, and geographical contributions to the overall identity of Iceland as a nation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people.\\" Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in \\"puritanical\\" America, \\"I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.\\"Buckley wrote that Bowie \\"mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock\\", and was probably \\"never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual\\", instead experimenting \\"out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'.\\" Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—the singer and his first wife Angie \\"created their bisexual fantasy\\".

This means they are dancing to a beat, and their dance moves will change according to the music. A is incorrect because it says their movements are out of control, but the paragraph says they are following steps in a structured manner.

This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment. We all say stupid shit sometimes; just laugh at yourself and enjoy the silly moment.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all. Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles less? A:","completion":"A: Asafa will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles less.

Background: Kenneth Duva Burke (May 5, 1897 - November 19, 1993) was an American literary theorist, as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century philosophy, aesthetics, criticism, and rhetorical theory. As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional rhetoric and view literature as \\"symbolic action.\\" Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc. Context: He was born on May 5 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Peabody High School, where his friend Malcolm Cowley was also a student. While he attended Ohio State University to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin, he later dropped out to move closer to New York City where he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the Boar's Head Society. Due to the constraining learning environment, however, Burke also left Columbia, never receiving a college diploma. In Greenwich Village he kept company with avant-garde writers such as Hart Crane, Malcolm Cowley, Gorham Munson, and later Allen Tate. Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic. In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock (1922-1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (b. 1920); and writer and poet France Burke (b. ~1925). He would later marry her sister Elizabeth Batterham in 1933 and have two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine The Dial in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927-1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the Dial Award in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of The Nation from 1934-1936, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935. His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight. As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including Bennington College, while continuing his literary work. Many of Kenneth Burke's personal papers and correspondence are housed at Pennsylvania State University's Special Collections Library. However, despite his stint lecturing at Universities, Burke was an autodidact and a self-taught scholar. In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson Harry Chapin, a contemporary popular song artist. He died of heart failure at his home in Andover, New Jersey. Question: What other books did he write?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Kenneth Burke wrote many books in his lifetime. Some of his well-known books include: 1. Counter-Statement (1931) - A collection of essays that discuss literature, art, and the creative process. 2. Permanence and Change (1935) - A book exploring human communication and how people react to change. 3. A Grammar of Motives (1945) - A book that examines the ways humans use language and symbols to express their motives in different situations. 4. A Rhetoric of Motives (1950) - A follow-up to \\"A Grammar of Motives,\\" this book studies rhetoric and the use of symbols in persuasion. 5. The Rhetoric of Religion (1961) - A book discussing the use of language and symbolism in religious texts and practices. These are just a few examples of the many books Kenneth Burke wrote. He was an influential writer and theorist, and his ideas continue to be studied today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Did Loch Ness Monster’s saltwater cousin sink German U-boat UB-85 for the British in 1918? Engineers discovered wreck of the vessel off Scottish coast this week, reviving legend of the sea serpent's attack A REDISCOVERED German U-boat whose captain insisted it was sunk by a sea serpent could have been attacked by Loch Ness’s saltwater cousin, it has been claimed. UB-85 was finally found off the west coast of Scotland this week nearly 100 years since it was scuttled in the final months of the First World War. No German sailors went down with the 56-metre vessel and its captain Günther Krech reported being attacked by a large sea creature when captured by the Royal Navy. Under questioning by British forces he went on to describe how the ship's gunners fired at the mysterious creature's arms. But the ship was so badly damaged it could no longer dive beneath the waves - exposing it to the British fleet. He described a horned beast that possessed glinting eyes and small deep-set eyes. Its huge weight saw the U-boat list dangerously to one side, according to the legend. Now, the discovery of the wreck 50-metres underwater by engineers laying sea cables has revived the myth that a sea serpent joined the Allied war effort in April 1918. Loch Ness sighting expert Gary Campbell is convinced the animal was involved in the sinking of UB-85 - which was scuttled by sailors from HMS Coreopsis. He told the Guardian: \\"It’s great to see how Nessie’s saltwater cousin clearly got involved in helping with the war effort – she even managed to do the damage without anyone being killed.\\" The site of the wreck lies around 200 miles south of the Loch - which is connected to the sea via the River Lochy. The area was littered with German U-boats which were trying to cut off British supplies lines and starve the country into submission. More than 351 vessels sunk around 5,000 Allied merchant ships during the course of the war. The legend of the Loch Ness Monster captured the world's imagination in 1933 when a picture taken by a London doctor caught what appeared to be a long-necked animal swimming through the giant body of water.

The A&E is where people go when they have accidents or sudden health problems. Sometimes, after the inspection, if a hospital's A&E isn't doing a very good job, they might have to close it down to make things safe for patients. This might make some people unhappy because they might have to go to another hospital that is farther away. The CQC is planning to check all the hospitals in the next two years to make sure they are doing a good job. The boss of the CQC, David Prior, told a newspaper that some more hospitals might have to close their A&E departments after this checking process.

Ann Rule published more than three books","completion":"Yes, it is true that Ann Rule published more than three books. Although the provided paragraph specifically mentions her well-known works, \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" and \\"Small Sacrifices,\\" these are not the only books she wrote. Throughout her career, Ann Rule was a highly accomplished and prolific true crime author who penned over 30 books and dozens of articles, primarily focusing on cases in the Pacific Northwest and Washington state. Her works encompass a variety of formats, including full-length books, series, and shorter pieces for magazines. Rule's expertise in true crime stories was strengthened by her background as a former police officer and a criminal investigator. This allowed her to delve deep into the world of criminal psychology and provide insightful details on each case she wrote about. Some of her other notable books include \\"Green River, Running Red\\" which recounts the harrowing story of Gary Ridgway, the infamous Green River Killer; \\"Heart Full of Lies,\\" an in-depth look at the case of Liysa Northon who was convicted of murdering her husband; and \\"A Rose for Her Grave and Other True Cases,\\" the first in a series of true crime anthologies. It is essential to mention that Ann Rule’s writing style and the level of detail she provided in her works made her a highly respected and well-renowned figure in the world of true crime literature.

Article: Scientists in Colombia have trained a team of rats to help remove land mines from the countryside. Land mines are small bombs hidden in the ground and designed to explode when someone steps on them. When trained, the rats can smell special metals in the mines and then signal to their human team. Then why use rats for such an important job? In the past, dogs have been used to find bombs. Rats have a good sense of smell and can respond to orders, just like dogs do. But rats are much lighter than dogs. They stand less of a chance of setting off the mines, which explode under a certain amount of weight. What's more, the best rats are cheaper to keep than dogs. It costs about the same amount of money to take care of one dog as it does 70 rats. The rats have already been used in Tanzania, an African country with many land mines. Luisa Fernanda Mendez and her team in Colombia are training the even lighter Wistar rats. These are the white rats with red eyes that scientists often use in laboratory experiments. \\" _ even train their babies to perform their jobs, which saves us a lot of time, \\" Mendez said. Colombia has the second-highest rate of deaths from land mine accidents in the world. Last year, land mines killed 695 people -- 56 of whom were children. A criminal group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as well as other organizations, have placed the mines. FARC are strongly against Colombia's government. The group has placed mines all around its own bases and in many places in the countryside. In the past, the Colombian government hired peasants and poor farmers to find mines. Many of them died trying to find the well-hidden bombs. Colombian police official Erick Guzman hopes the team of rats can come to the rescue . \\"These rats will be a great help,\\" he said.

Make this proper case.","completion":"The area, commonly referred to as Polesie, holds significance for both Belarusians and Ukrainians as it has a rich history that traces back to its formation in December 1939. Polesie, also spelled as Polesia or Polesie, is a region located in the Eastern European Lowland, spanning across contemporary Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland. It is characterized by its unique geography, culture, and biodiversity, which have inspired a distinct way of life for the communities in the region. In December 1939, Polesie's contemporary political borders were established after a sequence of historical events. As a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed in August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, parts of eastern Poland were annexed by the USSR, creating Western Belarus and integrating it into the newly-formed Belarusian SSR. The specific annexed territories include the regions of Polesie, Volhynia, and Białowieża Forest. This event holds significant importance for both Belarusians and Ukrainians, as it marked a challenging period in the region's history that witnessed border transitions, population movements, and a shift in political systems. The acquisition of the Polesie area strengthened the cultural and economic connections between the different Slavic communities living within the Soviet borders, thereby fostering a sense of unity among the people. Polesie has a diverse natural landscape consisting of vast swamps, forests, and wetlands, contributing to its ecological significance. The Pripyat River, which flows through the heart of the region, plays a crucial role in shaping Polesie's geography and defining the lifestyle of its inhabitants. In addition to its natural beauty, Polesie has a rich cultural heritage, preserved in the customs, folk arts, traditional crafts, and architectural styles of the region. Due to this diverse environment, the area has become a haven for numerous plant and animal species, some of which are endangered or unique to Polesie. This ecological value has drawn the attention of researchers and conservationists who strive to study and protect the region's biodiversity. In conclusion, Polesie is a historically and ecologically rich area within Eastern Europe that holds great importance for Belarusians, Ukrainians, and Poles alike. The region was formally assembled in December 1939, and since then, this territory has played a significant role in shaping the cultural, social, and political heritage of the people who call it home. The preservation and celebration of this shared history are crucial for fostering unity and mutual respect among these communities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"As of the start of the 2021 NFL season, there are three Black head coaches in the league. They are Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brian Flores of the Miami Dolphins, and David Culley of the Houston Texans. However, it is worth noting that numbers can change over time with new coaching hires, firings, or promotions throughout the season or in future seasons. To get the most accurate and current number, it's best to check the latest news and updates in the NFL. Regarding the absence of minority QB (quarterback) coaches in the NFL, it is a separate and distinct issue from the number of Black head coaches. While both questions relate to the under-representation of minority coaches in the NFL, they focus on different coaching positions. The fact that there are no minority QB coaches in the league highlights the specific lack of diversity at a position that is crucial in developing quarterbacks, who are often the face of the franchise and play a major role in a team's success. Historically, there has been a perception that minorities were not suitable for the QB position due to biases, stereotypes or lack of representation in coaching staffs. While the situation for minority quarterbacks has improved significantly over the past couple of decades, the lack of representation within the coaching staff, specifically in the QB coach role, is still a problematic area. Several factors contribute to the lack of minority coaches in the NFL, including limited opportunities, implicit bias during the hiring process, organizational culture, and the NFL's \\"old boys' club,\\" which often perpetuates the cycle of hiring individuals who are a part of certain networks or have shared backgrounds. It's important to note that the NFL has implemented policies such as the Rooney Rule, which mandates that teams must interview at least one minority candidate for head coaching positions and some senior-level football operations positions. While this rule has had some success in addressing the under-representation of minority coaching candidates, it still doesn't fully cover other coaching positions, such as QB coaches. In conclusion, the two questions are related as both touch upon the issue of minority representation in the NFL coaching landscape. However, they are not paraphrases of each other, as the first question specifically asks about the number of Black head coaches, while the second question delves into the absence of minority QB coaches in the league."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Which light emitting diodes display the greatest number of characters?\\" Context: \\"Alphanumeric LEDs are available in seven-segment, starburst and dot-matrix format. Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character. Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of liquid crystal displays, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Dot-matrix LED displays display the greatest number of characters among the three types of alphanumeric LEDs mentioned: seven-segment, starburst, and dot-matrix. While seven-segment displays can handle all numbers and a limited set of letters and starburst displays can display all letters, dot-matrix displays provide greater flexibility and character range due to their use of individual pixels. In a dot-matrix display, characters are represented using a grid of small pixels, typically arranged in a 5x7 format. This allows for a much wider variety of characters, symbols, and even custom images to be displayed compared to seven-segment and starburst displays. The flexibility and versatility of dot-matrix displays have contributed to their popularity in various applications, including text-based notifications, advertisements, and animated graphics. However, it is worth noting that the widespread use of liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which offer even lower power consumption and greater display flexibility, has led to a decline in the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays in recent times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'Closest comparison I can think of is Pink Floyd, though some of the songs sound nothing like this.

Options: - bounding - death - grief - judgement - appeals Explain why a human would choose \\"death\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human might choose \\"death\\" to answer the question above because: Step 1: Analyze the question and options given. The question asks for a potential cause of having a last passing sentence. The options given are bounding, death, grief, judgment, and appeals. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options. Bounding refers to a particular movement related to leaping or jumping, which is not relevant to a last passing sentence. Appeals are generally related to legal contexts and mainly concern requesting changes to decisions. While they may be connected to a last passing sentence, they are not universally applicable. Step 3: Consider the remaining options. Death, grief, and judgment remain as options to consider. Step 4: Compare the plausibility of each option. Death is a plausible cause of a last passing sentence because it is the final moment of life, which generally results in a person's last words or expressions. Grief can be a consequence of death and loss, affecting individuals who are mourning but is not directly linked to a last passing sentence, rather a reaction to it. Judgment, although contextually viable in a legal sense, is not as universally applicable as death. Step 5: Choose the most fitting option based on the analysis.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who does Thespis suggests goes down to earth in disguise to mingle and judge for themselves what people think of them? from the following article ? Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth. Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis. The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them. They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth. Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence. Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter. Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need.

Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what does qatar export?\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"Qatar, a small yet affluent country located in the Arabian Peninsula, is known for its substantial hydrocarbon reserves and role in the global energy market, particularly natural gas. The country's main export products primarily revolve around the oil and gas industry. Here are the key exports of Qatar: 1. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): Qatar is the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, holding a significant market share. The country's large reserves of natural gas are mainly extracted from the North Field, which is the world's largest non-associated natural gas field. Major LNG customers include Japan, South Korea, India, China, and several European countries. 2. Crude oil: Alongside liquefied natural gas, Qatar also exports significant amounts of crude oil, although its production and export levels are much lower compared to other Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran. With vast oil reserves, crude oil sales continue to play a vital role in Qatar's national income. 3. Petrochemicals and Chemical products: Qatar's thriving oil and gas industry also supports a growing petrochemical sector that exports various products such as polymers, fertilizers, and chemicals. The country's petrochemical facilities manufacture a range of downstream products, creating added value in the export market. 4. Refined Petroleum Products: Qatar refines some of its crude oil and processes it into various petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other fuel oils. These products are then exported to markets around the world. 5. Aluminum: Outside of the energy sector, Qatar is also a significant exporter of aluminum. Qatalum, a primary aluminum producer in Qatar, operates a large production facility that has an annual capacity of over 600,000 metric tons. This non-energy sector export contributes to Qatar's foreign exchange earnings. 6. Steel: Qatar Steel, a key steel producer in the Middle East, also contributes to the country's export portfolio by exporting its products like rebar, wire rod, and steel billets to international markets. In summary, while Qatar is primarily recognized for its export of liquefied natural gas and crude oil, it also exports a diverse range of products within and beyond the energy sector. With a strong focus on its hydrocarbon industry, the country continues to invest in growth and diversification strategies to maintain its position as a global exporter and economic powerhouse."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: In feet what altitude were the bats found in Slovakia from the following article ? A small Myotis was captured at a cave in Latvia between 2007 and 2010; pending genetic testing, it is suspected to be M. alcathoe. However, this record had not been confirmed in the subsequent national report to EUROBATS in 2014. Luxembourg A single male was caught in 2011 and confirmed as M. alcathoe on the basis of genetic data. Elsewhere in the country it has been recorded on the basis of acoustic data. Poland The species was recorded in four caves in southern Poland in 2005 and 2006, and later at several other sites in the south of the country. It is known from 182 to 1,294 m (597 to 4,245 ft) above sea level, most often in beech forest (Fagus sylvatica), but also in several other forest types. Romania A single M. alcathoe was captured in 2007 in a nature reserve in the eastern Carpathians; the reserve contains riverine and conifer forest. The species was additionally recorded in a forested valley containing a small stream in Alba County. Russian part of Caucasus Bats collected in the Russian part of the Caucasus and in Abkhazia (a breakaway part of Georgia) from 2003 to 2009 may represent M. alcathoe. They are small and morphometrically distinct from other local Myotis mystacinus-like bats. The affinity of these bats to M. alcathoe has recently been confirmed by the genetic and morphological analyses. Serbia The species was reported on the basis of three specimens shortly before 2009, but is probably rare. Slovakia Here, M. alcathoe is known from a single site, a cave in old deciduous forest at 525 m (1,722 ft) altitude. Slovenia A single specimen was recorded in Slovenia in 2007, although it is not clear how many bats previously recorded as Myotis mystacinus belong to this species. Several additional specimens were later found in Kočevski Rog (SE Slovenia).

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"300 million\\" correctly answer the question \\"How much money did al Qaeda use to fund the 9/11 attacks?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"300 million\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"How much money did al Qaeda use to fund the 9/11 attacks?\\". According to the paragraph, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The 300 million figure mentioned in the text refers to the purported inheritance of Osama Bin Laden, which was later discovered to be inaccurate and not a source of funding for the 9/11 attacks.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Areus I (died 265 BC) was Agiad King of Sparta from 309 to 265 BC, who died in battle near Corinth during the Chremonidean War. He was the grandson of Cleomenes II and was succeeded by his son Acrotatus II. - Agesipolis II (died 369 BC), son of the king Cleombrotus I, succeeded his father and reigned as Agiad King of Sparta. His rule was exceedingly brief, from, at most, 371 until his death in 369 BC. He was succeeded by his brother Cleomenes II. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - In Greek mythology, Eurotas was a king of Laconia, the son of King Myles and grandson of Lelex, eponymous ancestor of the Leleges. He had no male heir, but he did have a daughter Sparta and wife Clete. Eurotas bequeathed the kingdom to Lacedaemon, the son of Taygete, after whom Mount Taygetus is named, and Zeus, according to Pausanias. Lacedaemon married Sparta and renamed the state after his wife. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. - Cleomenes II (died 309 BC) was Agiad King of Sparta from 369 to 309 BC. The son of Cleombrotus I, he succeeded his brother Agesipolis II. He was the father of Acrotatus I, the father of Areus I, and of Cleonymus, the father of Leonidas II. - Cleombrotus I ( Greek : ; died July 6 , 371 BC ) was a Spartan king of the Agiad line , reigning from 380 BC until 371 BC. Little is known of Cleombrotus ' early life . Son of Pausanias , he became king of Sparta after the death of his brother Agesipolis I in 380 BC , and led the allied Spartan - Peloponnesian army against the Thebans under Epaminondas in the Battle of Leuctra . His death and the utter defeat of his army led to the end of Spartan dominance in ancient Greece . Cleombrotus was succeeded by his son Agesipolis II. His other son was Cleomenes II. Many historians cite Cleombrotus as being a Pro-Theban Spartan ( meaning he had pro-Theban tendencies ) unlike his fellow king , Agesilaus II. He was blamed for the humiliating defeat at Leuctra by his contemporaries for being biased towards the enemy , though some modern historians do not believe that he was actually pro-Theban . - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Leonidas II (Greek: B, \\"Lion's son\\", \\"Lion-like\\"), was the 28th Agiad King of Sparta from 254 to 235 BC. He was raised at the Persian Court, and according to Plutarch's Life of Agis IV, he married a Persian woman. According to other sources, this non-Spartan wife was actually a Seleucid, possibly the daughter of Seleucus I Nicator by his Persian wife Apama. She was therefore not fully Persian, but half-Macedonian and half-Persian. His Persian-influenced lifestyle, his non-Spartan (therefore foreign) wife and his half-Spartan children would all be made issues by the ephor Lysander, the co-king Agis IV and their supporters. - Acrotatus I (Gr. ) was the son of Cleomenes II, king of Sparta. He incurred the displeasure of an influential group of Spartan citizens by opposing the decree which was to release from infamy all who had fled from the battle in which Antipater defeated Agis in 331 BC. He was thus glad to accept the offer from the Agrigentines who had asked Sparta for assistance in 314 BC against Agathocles of Syracuse. - Epaminondas (\\"Epameinondas\\"; d. 362 BC) was a Theban general and statesman of the 4th century BC who transformed the Ancient Greek city-state of Thebes, leading it out of Spartan subjugation into a pre-eminent position in Greek politics. In the process he broke Spartan military power with his victory at Leuctra and liberated the Messenian helots, a group of Peloponnesian Greeks who had been enslaved under Spartan rule for some 230 years after being defeated in the Messenian War ending in 600 BC. Epaminondas reshaped the political map of Greece, fragmented old alliances, created new ones, and supervised the construction of entire cities. He was also militarily influential and invented and implemented several major battlefield tactics.

Given the below context: The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" was shot immediately after that of \\"If I Were a Boy\\", but it received less attention during production than the \\"higher-gloss, higher-profile video\\" for \\"If I Were a Boy\\". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" seen on The Ed Sullivan Show, which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's \\"Walk It Out\\" was dubbed over the original mix.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Erden Eruc has been rowing across the Pacific Ocean in a rowboat since he left California on July 10, 2007. He has been heading for Australia with only birds, fish, and sharks ever since. Crossing the Pacific is only part of his journey. Eruc has decided to go all the way around the world using his own energy. He will row, bike, walk and climb the world without help from any motors at all. His plan includes climbing the tallest peak on six of the continents along the way. For the first part of his trip, he bicycled 5,546 miles from Seattle, Washington to Mount McKinley in Alaska and back, walked 67 miles to base camp and climbed 20,320 feet to McKinley's peak. Now in the second part of his adventure , he is rowing to Australia. Why would he try to go around the world this way? He explains that he wants to encourage kids to dream their dreams and get to their own goals. He wants to show kids that there might be hard parts along the way, and sometimes they might not even get to that final goal. But they can have adventures and learn a lot along the way. When his trip around the world takes him across land, he enjoys meeting people---especially children. He has already visited many schools and shared his story. Eruc encourages all kids to set their eyes on a goal and not give up. He says, \\"with goals, we will make progress, and we will be farther along than when we started, even if we don't get to some goals. That's called life!\\" Question: We can learn from the passage that Eruc _ during his adventure.

In the article, it is mentioned that Erden Eruc is attempting to travel around the world using only his own energy, without the assistance of any motors. As part of this incredible journey, he has rowed across the Pacific Ocean in a rowboat, heading for Australia. This endeavor forms the second part of his larger adventure. Eruc's epic quest began with a 5,546-mile bicycle ride from Seattle, Washington to Mount McKinley in Alaska, followed by a 67-mile walk to the base camp and a 20,320-foot climb to McKinley's peak. Eruc's overall mission is to inspire children to dream big, set goals, and persevere despite the challenges they may face. He emphasizes the importance of setting goals and working toward them, even if some goals are not achieved along the way. Throughout his journey, Eruc has enjoyed meeting people, particularly children, and sharing his inspiring story at numerous schools. Given the details provided in the passage, option B, \\"rowed his boat,\\" is the correct answer. This choice highlights a key component of Eruc's adventure, as he seeks to complete his journey around the world using only human-powered transportation methods, such as rowing, biking, walking, and climbing. Options A, C, and D (taking a train, traveling by air, and traveling by bus) are incorrect, as they involve the use of motors, which Eruc is intentionally avoiding in his quest to circumnavigate the globe using only his own energy."},{"prompt":"What type of details about august wilhelm graf von kanitz can be gathered from the following bio?

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

After all, it’s easy to incorrectly identify a spider bite. It’s a good idea to get an large antihistamine injection as soon as you can, even if you don’t know the type of spider bite. While anti-venom is available in most ambulances, it might be a little while before the proper one can be selected and administered. This will help slow the spread of the venom and bring down the swelling. If you believe the bite is from a Brazilian wandering spider, apply a warm compress. This will help reduce blood pressure in the area. If the bite is on an arm or a leg, elevate the limb and tie a snug bandage above the bite. You should also move as little as possible to slow the spread of the venom. Be careful not to cut off circulation when tying the bandage. If you believe you are dealing with a redback bite, don’t tie a bandage around the area. Redback venom spreads slowly, so the bandage won’t do much except worsen the pain.

Seventy-five years ago, the government cut 65-year-old Ida May Fuller a check. It was numbered 00-000-001 - the first Social Security payout. Fuller, of Ludlow, Vermont, didn't realize it at the time, but her check helped launch the granddaddy of all entitlement programs. She had only paid three years' worth of payroll taxes before retiring but by the time of her death in 1975 at age 100, she collected 22,888.92 from Social Security monthly benefits.

It was numbered 00-000-001 - the first Social Security payout - here she is pictured in 1950 holding a Social Security check for 41.30 Today, even as its future lies in financial uncertainty, many consider","completion":"Social Security to be a crucial lifeline for millions of Americans who are retired, disabled, or otherwise in need of monetary support. In the decades since Ida May Fuller's first check was issued, the program has come a long way, evolving to accommodate the changing needs of the American population. The Social Security system was initially created in 1935 as a response to the Great Depression, with the goal of providing financial assistance to retired workers who may not have had ample savings or employment pension plans to support them. The program was designed to be funded through payroll taxes, with workers and their employers making equal contributions throughout their working lives. The financial stability of the program was based on the assumption that the number of younger workers contributing to the system would always be significantly larger than the number of retirees drawing benefits. However, as the U.S. population has aged and the birth rate has declined, the balance between contributors and beneficiaries has been disrupted, casting doubt on the sustainability of the system. Currently, Social Security not only provides benefits for retirees but also covers disabled workers, surviving spouses, and dependent children. About 64 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, with nearly 70% being retired workers who rely on the program as a major source of their income. Despite the crucial role it plays in providing financial stability for millions of Americans, the trust funds that support Social Security are projected to be depleted by 2035, bringing the future of the program into question. In light of this reality, various policy proposals have been put forth to address the looming financial crisis. Several potential solutions have emerged as being the most logical: 1. Increase the payroll tax rate: By moderately increasing the payroll tax rate, the additional revenue generated could be directed towards the Social Security trust funds, ensuring the system remains solvent for several more decades. 2. Raise the cap on taxable earnings: Currently, there is a limit on the amount of income subject to the payroll tax. By increasing or eliminating this cap, high-income earners would contribute more to the system, which would have a significant impact on Social Security's financial outlook. 3. Gradually increase the retirement age: Given that life expectancies have risen steadily since Social Security's inception, it would make sense to adjust the age at which full retirement benefits are received. By gradually raising the retirement age over time, the government could help extend the life of the trust funds without drastically reducing benefits for current retirees. 4. Make changes to the cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs): Adjusting the formula used to calculate COLAs could help put the program on a more financially sustainable path. This could be done by switching to a different inflation measure or modifying the way COLAs are determined. Ultimately, the future of Social Security will require a mix of adjustments to ensure that the program continues to provide essential support for millions of Americans who depend on it. The passage of time since Ida May Fuller received her first check only underscores the importance of reviewing and adapting the program to meet the evolving needs of the population. While there may be debate over which combination of proposed policy changes would be most effective, one thing is clear: without action, the financial stability of this vital social safety net is in jeopardy, and future generations may not have the same assurances enjoyed by retirees like Ida May Fuller. The most logical way to complete this passage is to emphasize the need for a bipartisan effort to preserve and strengthen Social Security, so that it can continue to serve as a lifeline for countless Americans in the years to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How Donald Lippincott blazed trail as first 100m record holder \\"There are so many stories in the walls,\\" says Gunilla Lyden, archivist, enthusiast, and key-holder to perhaps the best balcony in world sport. Her office (with balcony) lies up a stone spiral staircase in one of the most seductive sporting arenas anywhere: Stockholm's Olympic Stadium. Built for the 1912 Games, the stadium cost 1.25m Swedish Krona - around £5m in today's money. Its brown brickwork is handsome and its scale is intimate. And it is the oldest Olympic stadium still in use - for events ranging from local school competitions all the way up to the Diamond League. Lyden describes being among the 14,000-capacity crowd watching Usain Bolt win the 200m at a Diamond League meeting in July last year. It was so quiet, she says, \\"you could hear Bolt breathe\\". After much fiddling with keys, she opens the door and I am allowed to step on to her office balcony, with a view over the entire track. \\"This is where I can speak to my people,\\" she says, with a twinkle. \\"No, but the architect: he wasn't just creating a stadium. He was creating a dream.\\" The reality was impressive enough. The Stockholm stadium saw 83 world records set at the 1912 Olympics. Perhaps the most glittering was that set by an 18-year-old American, Donald F. Lippincott. This was how one American \\"One Cent\\" newspaper reported his achievement at the time: \\"LIPPINCOTT, PENN ATHLETE, CREATES WORLD'S RECORD. Stockholm, July 6. At the opening day's events of the Olympic games Donald F. Lippincott of the University of Pennsylvania hung up a new world's record for the 100 metres in heat 16, when he ran the distance in the marvellous time of 10 3-5 seconds.\\" These days, Donald Lippincott III remembers his grandfather as \\"a commanding presence, but not overbearing\\". A photograph of the time shows a bulky 18-year-old, with the slight slouch of a teenager unused to the attention. As he crouched at the start of a race, he tried to relieve excess nerves by squeezing a cork. It is still in the family's possession. But Lippincott almost did not make it to the Games at all. He had to raise, by himself, the money for his passage to Stockholm. And as his grandson recalls: \\"There is some lore in the family that his mother may have tried to block his going because he was her baby - the third child. And two months before, the Titanic had sunk. She couldn't bear the thought of losing him.\\" So Mrs Lippincott persuaded her husband to write their son a letter, saying that business was slumping. Donald Lippincott III laughs. \\"There's no record of business ever being bad before, but just by coincidence, it was suddenly bad. But then when he came up with (the sponsorship) money, it was hard for his parents to say no.\\" Lippincott ended up with the bronze in the final. Among the several false starts was one where he and the eventual winner ran the entire race, with Lippincott breasting the tape first, before they were called back. But he still had the world record from the heats - a record made official by the existence of the new International Amateur Athletics Federation. And 10.6 seconds is, as Imre Matrahazi, the IAAF's current keeper of the records, points out, an excellent time. \\"If you imagine the quality of the clay tracks then - and they didn't have starting blocks, they had to dig holes in the tracks. It really is an impressive time, 10.6 seconds.\\" That time was recorded by three men, in straw hats, standing next to the finish line and clicking their thumbs more or less simultaneously on three stopwatches. The Stockholm Olympics did experiment with \\"electric time-keeping\\" and photo finishes. But it would be 1921 before the first IAAF-sanctioned electrical time-keeping device was used. These days, a slit-film camera is aimed at the leading edge of the finish line, and takes 3,000 frames per second, as the runners clatter past. The technology and the athleticism are still improving. Matrahazi says, having watched Bolt set the latest world record of 9.58 seconds, he can imagine 9.5 seconds being within reach. Wherever the 100m is headed next, though, the Swedes will always have a boast of their own. Stockholm's stadium remains an impressive arena, still being used for sport a century after it was built. And it holds one achievement which will never be taken away. It is where the world's fastest man was - for the first time - officially fastest. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Donald Lippincott became the first official 100m record holder in 1912 at Stockholm's Olympic Stadium, setting a time of 10.6 seconds.

Article: Since the end of World War I (WWI) in 1918,Canadians, and millions of others around the world have paused at the 11thhour of the 11thday of the 11thmonth to honour the sacrifices our soldiers have made in different wars, fighting for the freedoms that we all enjoy today. Known as Remembrance Day, the day originated as a tribute to the soldiers of WWI, a dark period for our young country, which claimed the lives of over 60,000 military personnel and civilians and over 16 million dead worldwide. As there are no more surviving soldiers of WWI,today we rely on the wisdom and words of those soldiers who fought in the wars that followed,and this day now also recognizes their heroic contribution. They tell us to always remember what those brave souls fought for, and all they ask in return is that we never forget. That's why we wear the red poppy ;that's why when we see a soldier in uniform we should stop him or her and say \\"Thank you\\" ; that's why we take a pause from our busy lives for two short minutes today to honor that request. Yet this message is fading away, year after year. Take for example the terrible decision to allow parents to excuse students from Remembrance Day ceremonies at school. Not only is this disrespectful, it distances the student from his or her classmates. It is difficult to understand why any Canadian parent would want to remove their child from the time-honored tradition of reading the poem In Flanders Fields, while a wreath of poppies is laid. It is more important than ever to teach school-aged children about our history,no matter how violent it was. Sheltering them from the realities of war is a great disservice. Understanding why conflicts happened, or happen today, can help shape choices and decisions they make as adults. Of course, because we live in a free society, we cannot force an individual to do something. _ is unfortunate, but some parents now have their child \\"opt-out\\" of the services. These people should be reminded they are free to make such choices only because of the men... Question: What can we learn from the passage? - War history is too violent for school children. - The writer was once a soldier in the Canadian army. - Few students are willing to take part in Remembrance Day ceremonies. - More parents are keeping their children away from frightening war stories. A:","completion":"From the passage, we can learn that more parents are keeping their children away from frightening war stories. The author expresses concern that the tradition of honoring soldiers' sacrifices during Remembrance Day is fading away, and they believe it's crucial for school-aged children to learn about history, including the realities of war, to help shape their decisions as adults."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'll break down the answers to your questions so they are easier to understand. 1) Which professors make great mentors to undergraduates at Delhi Technological University (especially in Data Mining)? The first question is asking about specific teachers at a school called Delhi Technological University who are good at helping students learn about Data Mining. Finding the right professor may involve asking for suggestions from classmates or seniors and looking up the professors' profiles on the school's website. Remember, great mentoring experiences can be different for different people, so it's always good to explore different options. 2) Which kinds of software and technology are involved in data mining? How is data mining regulated or processed, if at all? The second question has two parts: a) What kinds of tools help with data mining? Data mining is like finding hidden treasures (information) in a big pile of mess (data). To do this, people use special software and tools that help them look for patterns and useful information. Some popular ones are called Excel, Python, and R. b) How is data mining regulated or processed? Data mining has some rules because sometimes information can be private or sensitive, like your favorite toy. When people mine data, they have to be careful not to peek into someone else's private information. Regulation means there are rules for keeping information safe and secure. Processing involves sorting and organizing the data so it becomes easier to find those hidden treasures. Lastly, your two questions are not asking about the same information. The first question is about finding a good teacher for Data Mining at a university. The second question is about the tools and rules used in Data Mining. They're related because both are about learning and understanding Data Mining, but they ask for different details."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Controversial shock jock Anthony Cumia, who rose to fame as co-host of the \\"Opie & Anthony\\" radio show, was arrested on strangulation and assault charges on Long Island, police said Sunday. Cumia, 54, was at his Roslyn Heights home around 11 a.m. ET Saturday when he got into an argument with a 26-year-old woman that turned violent, according to Nassau County police. He was arrested Saturday morning on charges of strangulation, assault, criminal mischief and unlawful imprisonment. “Mr. Cumia emphatically denies the allegations brought against him, and is optimistic that when the truth comes out, he will be exonerated,\\" Cumia’s attorney, Alan Schwartz, said in a statement. \\"Simply put, things are not always what they appear to be, and this case is a perfect example of that.” Cumia pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Sunday and was released without bail. An order of protection requires him to stay away from the woman. The radio personality has been hosting his own online show since last year, after he was fired for what satellite radio company SiriusXM called a hate-filled Twitter rant. The company fired him from the show after he expressed his outrage at a woman he said punched him in the face on a New York street. His tweets used an expletive degrading to women, and SiriusXM called them \\"racially charged.\\" The woman he encountered is black. At the time, Cumia said he used words like \\"animal\\" and \\"savage\\" to describe people who resort to violence, not people of a certain race. He said the tweets echoed the way he had spoken on the radio for years, and he refused to apologize. ||||| Warning: Video contains graphic language Disgraced former “Opie and Anthony” radio host Anthony Cumia was arrested after a fight with his girlfriend, which she partially captured via live streaming video in a clip that shows her claiming he broke her hand, police sources said Sunday. The 26-year-old woman claims in the video — which was posted on the Periscope app under the name Dani Golightly — that Cumia, 54, “turned off” her phone when she tried to call the police. “Hi, I’m in Long Island, I got my hand broken, I’m waiting for police to come,” said the distressed woman, whose real name has not been released. “I tried to call the police, but he turned the phone off.” The video sharply cuts to the ground, and she yells, “Oh, my God, don’t hit me! . . . Stay away from me!” The footage then pans to Cumia, who says, “I’ll pay you to leave my house.” She screams right back, “I don’t need you to pay for a car! I need you to pay for my f–king broken hand!” Cumia, who appears to be holding a beer, plays it for laughs, “Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Anthony and Dani show!” he says as he walks toward her, she backing away in apparent fear. Cumia — who was thrown off the radio show last year after going on a racist Twitter rant — now hosts the Web-based “The Anthony Cumia Show.” He was arrested Saturday morning at his Roslyn Heights home and charged with strangulation in the second degree, unlawful imprisonment in the second degree, assault in the third degree and criminal mischief in the third and fourth degree. Various social-media accounts describe Golightly as a “NY comic.” She was also introduced as comedian Vinnie Brand’s daughter Danielle in a June 27, 2008, interview on the “Opie and Anthony” show. The shock jock entered a plea of not guilty and was released on his own recognizance, though he was ordered to stay away from the woman. “Mr. Cumia emphatically denies the allegations brought against him and is optimistic that when the truth comes out he will be exonerated,” his defense attorney, Alan Schwartz, said in a statement. Cumia is scheduled to return to court on Jan 4. The radio host lost his SiriusXM show in 2014 after he made a number of tweets about a Times Square run-in he had with an African-American woman. “So, I’m taking pix in NYC & a black girl who was in frame punched me in the face. I called her a f–king “&;;-:” cause that’s what she WAS!” he wrote. “She’s lucky I was a white legal gun owner or she’d be dead.

Here is an article: January 16, 2014, 7:18 am Businesses have always lived by word of mouth, but in the old days the process was diffuse, hidden, incremental. Then Yelp kicked things up a few notches. It was bad news for bad businesses. Some shopkeepers and restaurant owners have been railing against Yelp since it began. They say customers try to blackmail them — “I want a free dessert or I’m going to post a negative review.” They mutter that Yelp shakes businesses down for advertising. There is no evidence this is true, and lawsuits alleging it have gone nowhere, but the scenario nevertheless populates the comments threads on news stories about Yelp. Now a Virginia carpet and rug cleaner is mounting a different sort of challenge to Yelp. Hadeed Carpet, a business in a Washington, D.C., suburb, had a bunch of negative reviews, the kind that would make any potential customer keep walking. For example, Bob G. said Hadeed ripped him off when he was in desperate need of carpet cleaning. Chris H. said he sent his “precious Afghan and other rugs” to Hadeed, all of which they shrunk. “I was shocked by how they handled my situation,” Chris added. Several customers complained that final charges were double the estimate they had been given. Hadeed asserts that Bob G. and the rest likely do not exist; presumably they were created by competitors trying to bring Hadeed down. That would remove the reviews from the protection of the First Amendment and make them slander. So it filed suit against the anonymous reviewers, and sought to compel Yelp to turn over their real names. If businesses could routinely do that with Yelp’s 47 million reviews, that might significantly undermine the site’s power. “Hadeed Carpet services 35,000 customers per year,” wrote the company’s lawyer, Raighne Delaney, in a comment on a Public Citizen post about the case. “It advertises a lot. It is interesting that a few anonymous comments target Hadeed Carpet’s advertising repeatedly. Are these different posters, or one poster with different names? Hadeed Carpet has not been able to identify these people as customers. If they are customers, Joe Hadeed wants to know so he can fix whatever problem he has.” A local court found in favor of Hadeed in late 2012, ordering Yelp held in civil contempt for failing to comply with the carpet cleaner’s subpoena. Now a Virginia appeals court has affirmed that ruling. The appeals court noted that dissatisfied customers “have a constitutional right to speak anonymously over the Internet. However, that right must be balanced against Hadeed’s right to protect its reputation.” As it stands, the ruling could open the door to a lot of lawsuits, at least In Virginia. “We feel this ruling fails to protect the free speech rights of Internet users, and in particular the rights of consumers who are turning to sites like Yelp to share their experience with a local business,” Yelp said in a statement. The site is appealing to the Virginia Supreme Court. Hadeed has been in business for over 50 years. It would be interesting to get Joe Hadeed’s comments on the suit, in particular who he thinks has such a great interest in maligning him. But he did not return a request for comment. A look at the Yelp page of Hadeed’s Alexandria location reveals 15 reviews. The two most recent are enthusiastic but most of the rest are pans. There are complaints about lowball price estimates, about a botched delivery and the actual work. “Carpets look worse after Hadeed ‘cleaned’ them,” one reviewer wrote. Those in search of a more upbeat picture can easily find one on Hadeed’s own site. Dozens of reviews are there, just about all laudatory. “Their pickup crew was on time, professional, and sweet to our two kitties,” wrote Fran, who chose anonymity even though she had only good things to say.

Answer: Between 1990 and 2010, about 663 million people moved above the absolute poverty level. Question: how poverty affects intelligence","completion":"No, this answer does not directly address the question of how poverty affects intelligence. To provide a detailed answer to the question, \\"how does poverty affect intelligence\\", we can discuss the following factors: 1. Nutrition: Poverty often leads to inadequate and insufficient nutrition, which can affect a child's brain development and cognitive function. Malnutrition, particularly during prenatal development and early childhood, can lead to long-lasting deficits in cognitive abilities. 2. Stress: Living in poverty can expose individuals to chronic stress, which may negatively affect brain development and cognitive functioning. Chronic stress has been linked to impairments in memory, attention, and decision-making. 3. Environmental factors: Poverty is often associated with substandard living conditions that expose individuals to harmful environmental factors such as lead or air pollution. These toxic exposures may result in diminished cognitive abilities and increased incidence of learning disabilities. 4. Limited access to quality education: Impoverished families often reside in areas with underfunded and low-performing schools, restricting access to proper educational resources and opportunities. These educational disparities can contribute to lower cognitive development and inhibit the acquisition of essential skills and knowledge. 5. Lack of cognitive stimulation: Children growing up in impoverished environments may have less access to stimulating activities and materials that foster cognitive development, such as books, educational games, and extracurricular activities. Cognitive stimulation is an essential component for the development of intellectual abilities. In conclusion, poverty can have several negative effects on intelligence through poor nutrition, chronic stress, exposure to harmful environmental factors, limited access to quality education, and lack of cognitive stimulation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Located on a remote island, the prison is a marvel of modern technology, designed to be escape-proof, and is viewed as the ultimate answer to the overwhelming crime rates plaguing the world. Our protagonist, James \\"Twitch\\" Callahan, is a former special forces operative who has been wrongfully convicted of treason against the United States due to a conspiracy involving corrupt officials and arms dealers.

Since the paragraph is discussing the process of expunging criminal records and its implications, we want to choose an option that is consistent with this topic and provides relevant information.

Possible answers: (a). bladder; (b). pelvis; (c). cranium; (d). clavicle; Q: What supports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the underlying nerves and blood vessels? A: Answer:","completion":"(d). Clavicle; The clavicle, also known as the collarbone, supports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the underlying nerves and blood vessels. The clavicle is a long, slightly curved bone that connects the shoulder blade (scapula) to the sternum (breastbone) at the anterior aspect of the thorax. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the shoulder joint by providing stability and preventing dislocation. The clavicle serves as a strut, supporting the upper limb and transferring the forces generated by the arm to the axial skeleton. This ensures that any pressure or stress placed on the limbs is distributed evenly throughout the body, preventing injuries and maintaining balance. Several important nerves and blood vessels pass beneath the clavicle, making it a key component in the protection of these structures. The major blood vessels include the subclavian artery and subclavian vein, which supply and drain blood from the upper limb. The nerves that lie underneath the clavicle are part of the brachial plexus, a network of nerves that control sensation and movement in the arm and shoulder. By protecting these structures, the clavicle ensures their proper function and minimizes the risk of injury. Moreover, the clavicle plays a role in facilitating various movements of the shoulder and upper limb, such as elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction. Several muscles attach to the clavicle, including the pectoralis major, deltoid, trapezius, and sternocleidomastoid. These muscular attachments enable the clavicle to act as a pivot point for the scapula, allowing it to move in multiple planes and providing the necessary range of motion for different activities. In summary, the clavicle supports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the underlying nerves and blood vessels. Its unique shape and strategic location make it an essential component of the shoulder complex, ensuring stability, protection, and facilitation of various movements involving the upper limb."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Schoolchildren from around Wales also performed a rendition of Myfanwy at St David's Cathedral, Pembrokeshire. The parade in Aberfan on Saturday was one of a number of events in Merthyr Tydfil county leading up to the anniversary of the disaster on Friday. It started at 11:00 BST when veterans from a number of regiments involved in the rescue operation left Aberfan Community Leisure Centre and marched to the memorial garden, where they laid a wreath. For many members of The King's Own Royal Border Regiment, it was their first time back in the village since 1966. They were able to see how the site of the old school had been transformed into a memorial garden. In October 1966, the soldiers had returned from weekend leave in Devon and answered a call to travel up, with 700 men stepping forward. David Baron, a retired staff sergeant who was a 19-year-old private at the time, described the \\"beautiful scene\\" as they approached Aberfan. But then, he said, he saw the \\"big black line\\" of coal waste running through the village, adding: \\"We suddenly realised it was so quiet because there were no kids around playing.\\" Neil Brennand, who was also a private at the time, said that the regiment helped dig graves and there were \\"grown men crying\\". He added: \\"It never leaves you. I think about it constantly. It scarred your life permanently.\\" About 100 people watched the parade, while flowers were also laid by a number of people, including the local mayor. Many tributes have taken place or are planned around the anniversary, with the Welsh football team visiting the village recently. Another event on Saturday called A Tribute to Aberfan saw schoolchildren from across south Wales perform, led by the Llanelli-based Hywel Girls' Choir and Hywel Boys Singers. They sang Myfanwy in Welsh costumes, with the song left unfinished and a single red rose left on stage in memory of the lost generation of Aberfan. The Hywel choir had begun performing worldwide before the disaster.

Freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited (though not necessarily illegal), though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser. In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door.

Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for Nevermind's songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he \\"heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.\\" Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as \\"the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.\\" Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa \\"blew my mind,\\" and that she \\"immediately went to track down Steve Albini.\\" Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.People connected with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: \\"I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw.\\" Gary Smith, who at the time was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he \\"was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record.\\" Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production \\"sounded way better than the other ones.\\"In 1991, as Pixies were recording Trompe le Monde, Albini described his impressions of Pixies during the recording of Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: \\"A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock. Their willingness to be 'guided'..., what would be the answer ?","completion":"Based on the information in the article, the first name of the person Cobain hired to produce In Utero is Steve. This is supported by the phrase \\"Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero,\\" where Albini refers to Steve Albini."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes.

(August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At the Presidio Army base in San Francisco, MP Patti Jean Lynch (Jenette Goldstein) is shot dead while investigating a break-in on the base and two San Francisco Police officers are killed in the getaway. Jay Austin (Mark Harmon), a San Francisco police inspector, is sent to investigate. He clashes with Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell (Sean Connery), the base Provost Marshal. Years ago, Austin and Lynch were partners while serving as MPs and Caldwell was their commanding officer. When Austin arrested Lieutenant Colonel Paul Lawrence (Dana Gladstone), Caldwell didn't support him. In the aftermath, Austin was demoted and decided to leave the army. Austin and Caldwell share a mutual dislike for one another. The murder investigation casts suspicion on Lawrence, as Lynch was killed with a Tokarev, a Russian pistol. Lawrence is the registered owner of a Tokarev, but claims he lost it in a poker game. Austin also learns that the getaway car used by Lynch's killer was registered to a civilian named Arthur Peale (Mark Blum), who is wealthy and owns a holding company that, in turn, owns other companies. Austin tries to question Lawrence about the Tokarev, but Caldwell intervenes. This fuels Austin's suspicions that Caldwell will do anything to protect a fellow officer from civilian authorities, even if he is a killer. Recognizing that part of the case is under Caldwell's jurisdiction at the Presidio and part is under Austin's jurisdiction in San Francisco, they uneasily team up to investigate the case. Caldwell states that if the Tokarev bullet that killed Lynch were to match a bullet fired earlier from Lawrence's Tokarev at the Presidio firing range, then Caldwell will arrange for Lawrence to surrender to Austin for arrest. In the meantime, Caldwell and Austin visit Peale, who claims his car was simply...

A business plan should describe, in detail, what your plans for the business are and what you hope to achieve. It should also outline the steps you plan on taking in order to reach your goals. A business plan must include an executive summary, which provides a one-page overview of your goals, as well as a market analysis, company description, description of the product line, funding request, financial projections, and more. Investors include anyone that you know or are somehow networked to who can give you money to start the business. Investors usually become part owners of your business. Lenders, on the other hand, are banks and other financial institutions you let you borrow the money in the form of loans. They do not become part owners, but you do need to pay the money back in time. You will need to contact your state government to apply for a business license/permit and to determine your business's tax status. Every state can determine its own regulations regarding business registration, but at the very least, you can expect to fill out the necessary registration forms and pay some sort of fee.

Today, he has two organisms to investigate, organism A and organism B. He notices that organism A has enzymes, but organism B lacks enzymes. He needs to figure out how these conditions would affect the organisms. But I can use this background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . What is an answer for this question: Under normal conditions, in which organism the chemical reactions would be more plausible, organism A or organism B? The answer is:","completion":"Under normal conditions, the chemical reactions would be more plausible in organism A, because it has enzymes that act as catalysts to speed up the necessary biochemical reactions required for life processes.

Patsy tells her Aunt Trish that it's wrong that they are pick-pocketing people, but Trish believes it's okay in some way, and tells her that they only steal from 'those who can afford it'. Trish's former beau Mel (David Hewlett) comes to the diner to talk to Trish, being chased by two guys to whom he owes money. Trish and Patsy leave to go to Limbers department store. Patsy puts on a blond wig and begins to pick-pocket Mr. Limber (Lawrence Dane), the owner of the store. They are caught by security guard Bert (Mark Ruffalo). Trish and Patsy are brought to the office of Limber and threatened with arrest. But since it is almost Christmas, it's late Friday, and Social Services is already closed, Bert is to keep a watch over them at his place, though he protests doing so. After Christmas, on December 26, he is to return them back to the office, when Patsy is to be given to a foster-family who can better look out for her interests and Trish is to face charges. As the hours go by, Trish and Bert begin to develop an attraction for each other. As Christmas is 'ruined' for Trish and Patsy, Bert takes them to Maplewood for his family's holiday dinner, and then to 'Santa's Castle' where Patsy confesses her bad deeds to Santa's head elf (Howard Hesseman) and writes Santa a note, asking him to deliver her bicycle to Bert's apartment, where they've been staying. Very early in the morning on December 26, Bert rushes to Limbers to buy the bicycle, and Patsy is elated to find it delivered later that morn. But then Patsy is kidnapped by Mel, who wants to use her to pick-pocket at Limbers during the after-Christmas crowd's rush to return gifts. He is caught by Bert and everyone ends up back in the office where Social Services officials await them. But with Patsy's wish coming true, they get a second chance. Mel is hauled off to jail.

Animals have been killed for their fur and feathers, for food, for sport, and simply because they were in the way. Thousands of kinds of animals have disappeared from the world forever. Hundreds more are on the danger list today. About 170 kinds in the United States alone are considered in danger. Why should people care? Because we need animals. And because once they are gone, there will never be any more. Animals are more than just beautiful and interesting. They are more than just a source of food. Every animal has its place in the balance of nature . Destroying one kind of animal can create many problems. For example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks , the farmers' stores of corn and grain were destroyed by rats and mice. Why? Because hawks eat rats and mice. With no hawks to keep down their numbers, the rats and mice multiplied quickly. Luckily, some people are working to help save the animals. Some groups raise money to let people know about the problem. And they try to get the governments to pass laws protecting animals in danger. Quite a few countries have passed laws. These laws forbid the killing of any animals or plants on the danger list. Slowly, the number of some animals in danger is growing. Animals are important to us mainly because _ . A) they give us a source of food B) they are beautiful and lovely C) they keep the balance of nature D) they give us a lot of pleasure Answer:","completion":"Animals are important to us mainly because \\"C) they keep the balance of nature\\". This is emphasized in the text through the example of how the extermination of hawks, a predatory bird that keeps down the populations of rodents like rats and mice, led to an explosive increase in the populations of these rodents, which in turn wreaked havoc on the farmers' stores of corn and grain. Animals, be they predators or prey, herbivores or carnivores, terrestrial or aquatic, all have a role to play in maintaining the equilibrium of our ecosystems. When one species is exterminated or its numbers drastically reduced, it upsets this equilibrium, often leading to unforeseen and usually negative consequences elsewhere in the ecosystem. Furthermore, each species contributes to biodiversity, which is critical for a healthy and resilient environment. Hence, the existence and protection of animals is integral to the balance of nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPTIONS: (i). negative (ii). positive","completion":"Based on the given options, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as (i). negative. Although the tweet is not directly displaying a very strong negative emotion, it contains a subtle element of negativity in its tone and content. The phrase \\"smack upside the head\\" implies an aggressive action, which often denotes a form of punishment or disapproval. The tweet seems to be expressing the notion that no such act of aggression (the smack) has occurred, implying that something may have warranted it. Additionally, the context in which the full statement is couched may seem to suggest a sense of disbelief or disappointment. To comprehensively analyze the sentiment in this tweet, here's a breakdown of the text: 1. \\"Not a single smack upside the head?\\" - This question indicates an element of surprise or doubt regarding the lack of a \\"smack.\\" It implies that the user expected a disciplinary action or an unfavorable response, which did not happen. The use of the question format adds to the feeling of curiosity and disbelief, which carries a negative undertone. 2. Phrasal implication - The phrase \\"smack upside the head\\" itself is typically considered negative, as it represents physical aggression or an expression of annoyance. Including such a phrase within a statement heavily suggests that the sentiment is negative. Considering these pieces of evidence, it is clear that the sentiment of the tweet is inclined towards Option (i). negative.

Gravitational Potential Energy is affected by position. Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask?

A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned suggests a situation in which a bird has no materials (sticks, grass, leaves, mud, and spider webs) left to build nests. This scenario would indeed have a direct and indirect effect on the process of creating more or larger nests. Direct effects: 1. Inability to build nests: If the bird has no materials to build nests, it simply cannot initiate or complete the nest-building process. This would prevent the creation of more nests and the expansion of existing nests. 2. Compromised nest quality: The lack of materials would make the bird unable to create sturdy and well-structured nests that can support eggs and provide a suitable environment for raising their offspring. Indirect effects: 1. Reduced breeding success: The inability to create more or larger nests would affect the bird's breeding success, as they would not have adequate space or suitable conditions to lay eggs and raise their offspring. This may result in a decline in the bird's population over time. 2. Changes in nesting behavior: In the face of material scarcity, birds might attempt to adapt by altering their nesting behavior. This could involve seeking alternative materials, resorting to communal nesting, or even choosing different nest sites, such as ground-based locations or man-made structures. 3. Resource competition: The reduced availability of nesting materials may intensify competition between birds for resources, leading to more territorial and aggressive behaviors. This could have ecological consequences, as it may influence the distribution and abundance of different bird species in a given area. In summary, the proposed perturbation would have a direct effect on the process of building more or larger nests, as well as indirect effects on the bird's breeding success, nesting behavior, and resource competition. This scenario emphasizes the importance of the availability of nesting materials for birds and the complex interplay between ecological factors and animal behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There are seven continents in the world. Among them, Antarctica is the most special one. It is a world of snow and ice all year round. China has sent many scientists there. They try to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology. What do they eat? Scientists don't have many choices on what they eat. About 60% their food is frozen food. It is easy to heat . Meat is common on the menu, while vegetables are not usual. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, people often eat dried and canned vegetables. How do they sleep? In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this time, Antarctica faces the sun and gets sunlight 24 hours of the day. In order to get some sleep,scientists cover the window with black cloth to make \\"night\\". How do they work? People can wear warm clothes to be against the cold weather, but they can do little with the strong wind. Sometimes, the wind is even stronger than a typhoon. It can easily blow people away. So there are ropes that connect some research stations. People can hold these ropes to keep balance in strong winds. How do they keep in touch with others? There are no cables or Internet on the frozen continent. So mobiles and computers don't work there. Scientists usually use two-way radios to communicate at work. If they want to say hello to family and friends, they can use the satellite phones. Question: What do scientists do in Antarctica? Options: A: They mostly study on the animals and plants there.

The answer is:","completion":"B: They mostly find resources and study climate change and sea biology. In the given article, it is mentioned that scientists are sent to Antarctica to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology. Although some aspects of the other options may also be included in their research, option B best sums up the scientists' primary activities in Antarctica. Climate change is a major area of focus for researchers as it has far-reaching consequences on global weather patterns and sea levels, affecting ecosystems and human societies alike. By studying climate change and sea biology, scientists aim to better understand the effects of global warming on ocean ecosystems, which in turn can provide insights into ways to mitigate or adapt to the changing environment. Additionally, the exploration of resources under the icy land can have significant implications for discovering valuable minerals, oil and gas deposits, and other vital materials that could have economic and technological benefits. This allows nations and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about the potential development and exploitation of resources in the region, while considering environmental preservation and sustainable practices. In conclusion, while the work of scientists in Antarctica might cover a broad range of fields, their main focus mentioned in the article revolves around finding resources and studying climate change and sea biology, which is best represented by option B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some of the other reviews point out how dumb Detention is, but many neglect to point out the positives. Any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can't be all bad. Why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens? Aren't there any other kind of teens? Does every group of teens have one angry black guy? One genius nerd that nobody likes? One slutty girl who is very friendly and (in this movie) pregnant? One disturbed anti-social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented (but what is the talent?). And one laid-back black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him. Then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color. They don't say much but get shot at some point. Detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school. Preferably with the writers inside. The dialogue is bad, and the plot is worse. When the bad guys (and girl) finally hijack a van full of drugs, then they sit inside the van making out. They drive the van to the school because they want to re-paint the van at the school's paint shop, but they never get around to re-painting the van. By the way, it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the Police Van. They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score. For some reason, they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren) even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours. The handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, so why go after them? Anyhow, the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns, and they keep finding the teens (including a guy in a wheel chair) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss. Towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed. For every time someone gets shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss. The stunts are pretty bad. I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of 10 Million, and I am amazed. When I saw the movie I figured maybe Lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher. Like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam.

Article: MSG (monosodium glutamate) is a food additive , which has been widely used by many food factories all over the world since it appeared first in Japan in 1909. MSG is a _ that is added to some food to improve its original taste and colour. It is used in foods around the world such as cakes, bread, frozen meats, fish and vegetables. In the beginning, people thought MSG was safe just like salt and sugar. However, in 1968 some people reported they seemed to have bad reactions to MSG after having had a meal at a restaurant. They included headaches and quick heartbeat . It was also reported that MSG excited a person's brain and caused his death in Japan. Scientists think that MSG may lead to many neurological disorders . In mice studies done by a university, the evidence showed the mice didn't want to eat the food including MSG. Today many food companies \\"hide\\" MSG on food labels by using different names. If you see \\"natural flavorings\\", \\"hydrolyzed protein\\" and \\"spices\\" in a food label, you are probably seeing a hidden way to \\"report\\" MSG in a food label. Every time we have a meal in a restaurant, we always feel the food very delicious to taste, but sometimes it is dangerous for our health because some poisonous food additives have been added to the food. To protect people's health, our governments, from central to local, are taking actions to stop factories producing poisonous food additives. Question: If you see \\"natural flavorings\\", \\"hydrolyzed protein\\" and \\"spices\\" in a food label, you will know _ .

She tried to put the marble in the pen cap, but she couldn't because the","completion":"marble was slightly too large for the pen cap. She examined the situation closely and considered her options for making the marble fit into the cap. Step 1: Assess the size difference She held the marble next to the pen cap to see how much bigger it was compared to the opening. She noted that the difference was only a few millimeters. This gave her hope that she could find a way to make it fit. Step 2: Consider the tools available She looked around her workspace and saw several items that could potentially be useful: a small file, sandpaper, a pair of pliers, and a small hammer. Step 3: Evaluate the risks and benefits of each tool She considered each tool's potential risks and benefits: - The file could be used to gradually shave down the marble, but it would require a lot of time and effort to get the right size. - Sandpaper might work, but it could take even longer than the file and would create a lot of dust. - The pliers might be useful for holding the marble steady while she worked on it, but wouldn't help with actually altering the marble's size. - Finally, the hammer could potentially crack or chip the marble to make it smaller, but there was a significant risk of damaging the marble or making it too small. Step 4: Choose the best tool After evaluating the risks and benefits, she decided that the file offered the best balance between safety and effectiveness. Step 5: Prepare the work area Before she began filing the marble, she put on a pair of safety goggles to protect her eyes, and laid a cloth down on the table to catch the marble shavings. Step 6: File the marble Using the file, she carefully shaved down the marble in a circular motion, periodically checking the size against the pen cap. She made sure to file in a consistent manner to maintain the marble's rounded shape. Step 7: Test the fit After she had filed the marble down enough to fit into the pen cap, she tested it by gently pressing the pen cap onto the marble. It fit snugly and securely. She tried rolling the marble in the cap to ensure that the fit was stable and correct. Step 8: Clean up Satisfied with her work, she carefully wiped away the marble shavings from the table and disposed of them in the trash. She put away the tools she had used and admired her new marble-topped pen cap creation. And so, she had successfully completed her task of fitting the marble into the pen cap. The pen cap now had a unique and personal touch, reflecting her creativity and resourcefulness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

First off, it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works. Some have, as Kubrick did with \\"Lolita\\", gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work. Of course that can't happen here; Kraft-Ebing is long dead. Some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new, unrelated direction (the recent adaptation of \\"Tristram Shandy\\" comes to mind here). You can dumb it down - the film of \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is to my mind an example of that. Or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes. That would be the approach of Woody Allen's \\"Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex\\", and, arguably, this film. Upon consideration, it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like \\"Psychopathia Sexualis\\". The potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed. And so it is here. Point two is the cinematic style. Some would call it an \\"homage\\" to Murnau, Pabst, Carl Dreyer, etc., but I think it more crude than that. Its far too heavy handed and self-conscious to be effective for long. It is eventually just annoying. Point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation. How did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring? I found the film impossible to pay attention to, and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well. I don't want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless, but I have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material, the overt copying of filmic styles, and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level (possibly for fear of being accused of titillation). The film is a dubious exercise from the start and doesn't really work for me, I'm sorry to say.

The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story.

He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books.

Please answer the following question: This article: In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is decided to not be an enemy of the Amazons?, what is it ?

The statue of which Royal person was unveiled in London's The Mall in February 2009????","completion":"In February 2009, a statue of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, was unveiled in London's The Mall. The statue of the late Queen Elizabeth (1900-2002) stands as a tribute to her remarkable life and her significant contributions as a member of the British royal family. The Queen Mother, as she was affectionately known, served as queen consort to King George VI from 1936 until his death in 1952 and is the mother of Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret. She was known for her warm and approachable nature, and she played an important role in maintaining public morale during World War II. Despite the many challenges faced during her time as queen consort, the Queen Mother remained resolute and endeared herself to the hearts of millions of people both in the UK and around the world. The statue, which is located on The Mall, near Buckingham Palace and Marlborough House, was created by Scottish sculptor, Philip Jackson. The larger-than-life-size bronze tribute represents the Queen Mother at the age of 51, which marks the beginning of her period as Queen Dowager. She is depicted wearing the robes of the Order of the Garter, a prestigious chivalric order, and is placed on a stone plinth with an inscription honoring her many years of service to the nation. The unveiling ceremony took place on February 24, 2009, and was attended by several members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, and The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. The statue project was commissioned by The Queen Elizabeth Castle of Mey Trust, which helped raise funds for the memorial. The Queen Mother's statue not only serves as a commemoration of her life but also stands as a testament to the enduring love and admiration that the British public held for her.

Question: Here's a question: The stabbing to death of a person is likely to create what on the ground? Here are possible answers to this question: - pool of blood - being arrested - garden - imprisonment - gruesome I believe the correct choice is \\"pool of blood\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice in response to the question about the probable outcome on the ground after a stabbing incident that results in a person's death is indeed \\"pool of blood.\\" This is due to various factors related to the human body, blood circulation, and the nature of stabbing injuries. Firstly, the human body contains a significant amount of blood that circulates through arteries, veins, and capillaries. In an adult body, the estimate is around 1.2-1.5 gallons (4.5-5.5 liters) of blood. When a person suffers a severe or fatal injury, such as being stabbed to death, the blood vessels are cut or punctured. As a result, blood starts to flow out of the wound created by the stabbing. Secondly, stabbing injuries, particularly those resulting in death, often involve deep, penetrating wounds. These wounds are likely to hit large blood vessels, such as arteries, which are under significant pressure due to the pumping action of the heart. When an artery is cut or torn, blood will rapidly flow out with considerable force, leading to a profuse bleed. Moreover, stabbing incidents involving multiple wounds further increase the likelihood of a considerable amount of blood being spilled from the injured person's body. Consequently, a stabbing to death will likely result in a pool of blood forming on the ground beneath and around the person's body. The pooling effect occurs due to gravity, which causes blood to flow to the lowest point, i.e., the ground or floor. It is intensified if the incident takes place on a flat or relatively smooth surface, which lacks any obstructions to hold blood within the location of the injury. In summary, the stabbing to death of a person is likely to create a pool of blood on the ground because of the significant volume of blood in the human body, the high pressure of blood vessels, the nature of stabbing injuries, and the effect of gravity. The other options mentioned, such as being arrested, garden, imprisonment, and gruesome, are consequences, descriptions, or unrelated terms that do not directly address the specific outcome of a fatal stabbing on the ground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Championship side Birmingham City have signed Middlesbrough right-back Emilio Nsue for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Birmingham City Complete the Signing of Middlesbrough Right-Back Emilio Nsue Birmingham City Football Club has bolstered their defense with the signing of Middlesbrough right-back Emilio Nsue on a three-and-a-half-year deal. The details of the signing remain undisclosed as both clubs strive to maintain confidentiality concerning financial terms. This move sees Nsue reunite with Birmingham City manager, Aitor Karanka, under whom he previously played at Middlesbrough. Emilio Nsue, a versatile 32-year-old footballer born in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, has featured prominently in both clubs and international matches. Nsue's career began in 2007 when he made his debut for RCD Mallorca in the Spanish La Liga. Throughout his time with Mallorca, Nsue made 110 appearances and scored 11 goals. In 2014, Nsue moved to England and signed with Middlesbrough under then-manager Aitor Karanka. During his tenure with Middlesbrough, Nsue proved to be a valuable asset, making 82 appearances and scoring three goals. He played an essential role in the promotion of Middlesbrough to the Premier League in the 2015-2016 season. Nsue continues to excel as a versatile player, capable of playing right-back or as a right-winger. His adaptability on the pitch will provide added depth and flexibility to Birmingham City's tactical approach for the remainder of the Championship season. The reunion with Aitor Karanka also suggests a strong bonding between the player and the manager. Already knowing the extent of Nsue's capabilities, Karanka will be able to utilize his skills effectively and may even improve his performance aspects further. Birmingham City, currently positioned in the middle section of the Championship table, will undoubtedly look to use this acquisition as an opportunity to mount a promotion push. Nsue will be a valuable addition in their quest for promotion and could potentially make an immediate impact on their defensive tactics. Nsue's international experience is another aspect that Birmingham City will look to capitalize on. He has represented both Spain and Equatorial Guinea in international football, making his debut for Equatorial Guinea in 2013 after featuring in various Spanish youth teams. Nsue has also featured in the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, captaining the Equatorial Guinea national team to the quarterfinals. His experience and leadership qualities will undeniably contribute to a stronger, more resilient Birmingham City side. Additionally, Nsue's signing helps address the growing concern surrounding the squad's defensive depth. This season, Birmingham City's defense has often been criticized for underperforming, with the club conceding numerous goals in crucial matches. The acquisition of Emilio Nsue is expected to help strengthen their defense, allowing a more stable back line and improved performance for the remainder of the season. In conclusion, Emilio Nsue's signing for Birmingham City is a strategic acquisition that could potentially play a pivotal role in the club's future success. Fans will be hoping that the familiar partnership between Nsue and manager Aitor Karanka will drive their team closer to achieving their goals: advancing higher in the Championship table, aiming for playoffs and possibly securing promotion. The versatile right-back with international experience brings additional depth to the squad, and his ability to contribute both defensively and offensively is expected to have a significant impact on the Blues' ambitions."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Definition: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Input: Step 1: For each row in section table, find corresponding rows in course table and in takes table. Step 2: find title of the results of step 1 whose takes's year equals 2010 and building equals Chandler Output:","completion":"To accomplish this task, follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the given task - You are supposed to write an SQL query that retrieves the title of the courses from the 'course' table and their corresponding rows from the 'section' and 'takes' tables with conditions that the 'takes' table's year should be 2010 and the building of the 'section' table should be equal to \\"Chandler\\". 2. Now, write the SQL statement following these guidelines: - Use the SELECT keyword to specify the columns you want to retrieve; in this case, it's the title from the 'course' table. - Use the FROM keyword to specify the primary table you're selecting from, which is the 'section' table. - Use the JOIN keyword to join the 'course' and 'takes' tables. - Use the ON keyword to specify the conditions for the join, usually by matching primary keys. - Use the WHERE keyword to specify the additional conditions required for the results, which are takes' year = 2010 and building = 'Chandler'. - At the end of the query, add a semicolon to indicate the end of the statement. Here's the final SQL statement: \`\`\`sql SELECT course.title FROM section JOIN course ON section.course_id = course.course_id JOIN takes ON section.section_id = takes.section_id WHERE takes.year = 2010 AND section.building = 'Chandler'; \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apple hints at 'exciting new product categories' updated 5:50 AM EDT, Thu April 25, 2013 | Filed under: CEO Tim Cook is typically tight-lipped about Apple's future plans, so observers parse his words for clues. (CNN) -- Gadget fans eagerly awaiting the next wave of Apple products just got some good news, and some bad news. First, the bad: Based on CEO Tim Cook's comments Tuesday on the company's quarterly earnings call, Apple appears unlikely to announce a major new product until this fall at the earliest. If so, that would mean the company, which typically rolls out new stuff every three or four months, will have gone an entire year -- an eternity in tech-industry time -- without launching a new gadget. And now the good: Cook also said Apple sees potential in some \\"exciting new product categories.\\" On the surface, there's not much news in that last statement. But as the most-watched tech company in the world, Apple's every utterance is parsed for its deeper meaning. Many observers see those four words as further evidence that Apple is moving beyond laptops, phones and tablets into other areas of computing -- most likely a \\"smartwatch\\" that could display messages, or a long-rumored connected TV. \\"Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software and services, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline,\\" Cook said, adding \\"we can't wait to introduce (them) this fall and throughout 2014.\\" This may just be corporate PR speak, aimed at assuaging investors concerned about Apple's plummeting stock price. But it could serve to re-energize the Apple faithful who line up to buy whatever new gizmos the company makes and may be growing impatient for new ones. Of course, Cook made similar comments early in 2012 when he said Apple was working to deliver \\"some products that will blow your mind.\\" What followed were the usual updates to Macs and iPods, plus the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini -- solid if not groundbreaking products. Blogosphere reaction this week to Cook's comments has been mixed. \\"Apple almost never spills any beans about what its product plans are, so it's worth getting excited about fall based on Tim's willingness to talk about that specific period, as well as his mention of 'new product categories,' \\" wrote Darrell Etherington in TechCrunch. \\"Still, unless he's purposefully trying to throw us off the scent, people eager for new Apple products might also want to sleep through the summer.\\" Slate's Will Oremus thinks Cook's teases about mind-blowing future products reflect a shift in Apple's approach to promotion since co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011. \\"In the past, Apple didn't have to promise exciting new things,\\" he wrote. \\"It just delivered them.\\" Most popular Tech stories right now What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses Apple CEO Tim Cook's hints at \\"exciting new product categories\\" during the company's quarterly earnings call in 2013.

While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo.

Except in the calmest of conditions, coming alongside another boat is a recipe for trouble. Wave action can slam the boats together, and, worse yet, crew members' extremities can get caught between them.","completion":"Instead, the most natural procedure to follow when towing a boat is to establish a secure and well-planned towing system to keep the vessels at a safe distance from each other. This involves using appropriate towing equipment, choosing the right towing points, and maintaining proper communication between the two boats. The following steps will guide you through the process of safely towing a boat: 1. Assess the situation: Begin by assessing the size and condition of the boat that needs towing and the environmental conditions. Consider factors such as wind, wave, and current strength when deciding the best method for towing. 2. Choose the right towing equipment: Select a towing line that is strong enough to handle the load and long enough to maintain a safe distance between the boats. Typically, a line with 2.5 to 3 times the length of the boat being towed is recommended. Additionally, ensure that the line has an appropriate attachment method, such as a bridle or shackle. 3. Identify towing points: Choose stable and secure towing points on both boats to minimize the risk of damage and ensure a controlled tow. On the towing boat, the towing point should be close to the waterline and in line with the boat's center of gravity. On the boat being towed, the towing point should ideally be located at the bow, offering more control and stability during the tow. 4. Connect the towing line: Once the towing points have been identified, securely attach the towing line to both boats using the appropriate attachments. Double-check that your line is securely fastened and won't come undone under strain. 5. Align the boats: Steering the towing boat in a straight line will help the towed boat maintain a safe and straight course behind it. Keep both boats pointed into the wind or current while connecting the towing line to prevent them from drifting apart or getting tangled in the line. 6. Maintain communication: Establish a communication system between the boats, either via VHF radio or agreed-upon hand signals. This will allow both boat crews to stay informed of any changes in the tow or potential hazards. 7. Start towing: Begin towing at a slow, controlled pace, gradually increasing your speed as both boats become aligned and stabilized. Monitor the towed boat's position constantly and adjust your course or speed as necessary to maintain a safe distance and prevent any sudden movements. 8. Plan your course: Navigate with caution, taking into consideration any potential hazards such as shallow water, submerged objects, or busy shipping lanes. Make sure that the towed boat can safely follow the chosen route. 9. Monitor the tow: Throughout the towing process, keep an eye on the towed boat and the towing line's condition. Check for any signs of wear, strain, or damage. Repair or replace the towing line if necessary. 10. Detach the towing line: Once you have reached your destination, carefully detach the towing line and secure both boats. Ensure that the boat being towed is in a safe location before disconnecting the line to prevent it from drifting away. By following these steps and taking appropriate safety precautions, you can efficiently tow a boat while minimizing the risk of damage or injury to both vessels and their crews."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pets are such sooks in Winter http://twitpic.com/4eb0k Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"Based on the text, it is possible to predict that the sentiment expressed in this tweet is quite positive. Several factors contributing to this positive sentiment can be identified. 1. Emotional Language: The use of \\"aww\\" and \\"super cute\\" as emotional expressions indicates that the speaker feels affectionately towards the subject being discussed, which in this case, is Downesy's cat. 2. Shared Experience: The mention of their own cat, Jackson, hunkering down in his bed highlights a similarity between the speaker and Downesy. Sharing a common bond of having pets that seek comfort during the winter season, and using the term \\"sooks\\" to describe them humorously adds warmth to the sentiment. 3. Use of an Image: The inclusion of a link to a Twitpic suggests that there is a visual element to the tweet, likely featuring the mentioned cat enjoying its warm bed. Sharing images of cute pets typically elicits positive emotions in both the sender and the receiver, which further reinforces the pleasant nature of the sentiment. 4. Light-Hearted Tone: The overall tone of the tweet could be classified as light-hearted, as it discusses a relatable and non-controversial topic. Conversations surrounding pets, particularly cats and dogs, often provide a sense of light-hearted amusement to those involved. In conclusion, taking into account the emotional language, shared experience, use of a visual element, and the light-hearted tone, it can be predicted that the sentiment of this tweet is decidedly positive. The sender effectively conveys appreciation for the endearing behavior of pets during the winter season, sharing one's own experiences, and fostering connection with the recipient through the discussed topic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Question: \\"If someone in America uses the word \\"evangelical\\", of what are they speaking?\\" Context: \\"During the Reformation, the term was hardly used outside of the German politics. The word evangelical (German: evangelisch), which refers to the gospel, was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement. Nowadays, this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations, above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD. The German word evangelisch means Protestant, and is different from the German evangelikal, which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism. The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches, and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole. It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States. The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German, and is different from English reformed (German: reformiert), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"When someone in America uses the word \\"evangelical\\", they are typically referring to Evangelical Protestant churches.

Write some highlights for the following article: Father-of-one Stefan Noyce, 29, passed out in the middle of the road after a night out and was run over, an inquest heard. A council worker downed so many shots of Sambuca and Jagermeister he passed out in the middle of the road and was run over, an inquest heard. Father-of-one Stefan Noyce, 29, was four-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit and in a state of 'extreme drunkenness' when he walked into a carriageway and lay down after a night out. Moments later motorist Chelcie Hunt, 18, struck the drunk pub-goer in her Mazda 121 on an unlit stretch of road in Wareham, Dorset, causing him fatal head injuries. She said she did not see the victim as he was wearing dark clothes and thought her car had hit an animal in the road on the night of June 15 last year. 'I was driving along and then when I got to the dark bit, where there are no lights in the road, I felt like I had gone over something,' she told a hearing at Bournemouth Coroner's Court. 'I just thought I had hit an animal or something.' The keen fisherman who had taken part in a TV series, Ocean Heroes, was described him as being in 'high spirits' by witnesses who saw him drinking shots at the Antelope Inn and Black Bear pub in Wareham. He was found lying on a pavement in Wareham at around 12.15am in an 'intoxicated and unconscious state', but he refused offers for a taxi. Witnesses watched him walk towards the nearby village of Stoborough, where he was staying the night with his grandmother, and lost sight of him as he entered the unlit portion of the road. The fatal collision happened 10 minutes later on the B3075 linking Stoborough to Wareham and Miss was found to have been within the 30mph speed limit. Police investigations showed Mr Noyce, who had a 10-year-old son, Blake, would only have been illuminated by the car headlights for one second before the collision. The keen fisherman who had taken part in a TV series, Ocean Heroes, was described him as being in 'high spirits' by witnesses who saw him drinking in the pub before the incident, pictured on a boat in Norway. He was described as a 'perfect gentleman' by his mother and leaves behind a 10-year-old son. Forensic pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said Mr Noyce's fatal head injuries suggested he was lying on the ground when he was hit and the 328mg of alcohol in his blood would have left him in a state of 'extreme drunkenness'. Richard Middleton, the assistant coroner for Dorset, said Mr Noyce's dark clothes and the unlit road may have been additional factors in his death. He said he was satisfied Miss Hunt had been driving carefully and was not speeding and ruled that Mr Noyce died 'as a result of a very tragic collision'. Mr Noyce's mother Paula Haden, who lives at Bovington, said: 'To me he was perfect. I am so proud of Stefan. I want the world to know what a lovely boy he was. 'He was just such a real gentleman. I was amazed at how many hearts he touched.' Before the accident he had worked for Dorset Waste Partnership and spent hours gardening for neighbours. He was hailed a hero as a teenager when he helped save the life of an elderly woman drowning in the River Frome. He had fished in Norway and worked for Dorset Waste Partnership before the incident in June lat year, pictured during filming for Ocean Heroes. Forensic pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said Mr Noyce's fatal head injuries suggested he was lying on the ground when he was hit, pictured on a boat in Norway. Flowers lie by the side of the B3075 South Causeway near Wareham after the 29-year-old was killed.","completion":"Stefan Noyce, a 29-year-old and father-of-one, tragically lost his life after passing out in the middle of the road due to excessive alcohol consumption and subsequently being run over. The inquest revealed that Noyce had been drinking heavily, consuming shots of Sambuca and Jagermeister, which left him four-and-a-half times over the drink-drive limit. He collapsed on an unlit stretch of road in Wareham, Dorset, where motorist Chelcie Hunt accidentally struck him with her car, causing fatal head injuries. Hunt, aged 18, did not see Noyce, who was dressed in dark clothing, and initially thought she had hit an animal. The collision occurred on the B3075, linking Stoborough to Wareham. Police investigations indicate that Noyce would have been visible to Hunt for only one second before the accident. The assistant coroner for Dorset, Richard Middleton, found that Hunt had been driving carefully and within the speed limit, ruling Noyce's death a tragic accident. Witnesses recalled Noyce being in high spirits earlier in the evening while drinking at the Antelope Inn and Black Bear pub.

MacArthur Foundation has announced the winners of this year's fellowship — often better known as the \\"genius\\" grant — and the list includes a characteristically wide array of disciplines: There's painter Njideka Akunyili Crosby, for instance, and mathematician Emmanuel Candès and immunologist Gabriel Victora, among many others. (Note: The foundation is among NPR's financial supporters.) Each of the recipients has been selected for having \\"shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction\\" — and each will receive a 625,000 award from the foundation \\"as an investment in their potential,\\" paid out over five years with no strings attached.

The Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation on Wednesday announced the 24 fellows, who each receive 625,000 over five years to spend any way they choose. The recipients work in a variety of fields, from computer science to theater, immunology and photography. The foundation has awarded the fellowships annually since 1981 to people who show \\"exceptional creativity in their work and the prospect for still more in the future.\\" Previous winners have included \\"Hamilton\\" playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, and author-journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates. There is no application process. Instead, an anonymous pool of nominators brings potential fellows to the foundation's attention. Those selected learn they've been chosen shortly before the awards are announced. For opera director and producer Yuval Sharon the news that he had been selected was \\"an enormous shock and honor.\\" When the foundation called, he assumed they were seeking a referral for someone else who'd been nominated. \\"I'm totally amazed,\\" said Sharon, 37, the founder and artistic director of The Industry, a Los Angeles-based production company that produces operas in nontraditional spaces and formats.

His next work, an adaptation of the radio program \\"War of the Worlds\\" will utilize decommissioned World War II sirens to broadcast the performance occurring inside the theater onto the streets. The sounds of performers stationed outdoors — and likely the traffic and other street noise — will then be transmitted back into the concert hall. Sharon said he comes across many people who don't think opera is for them, but he hopes hearing about these kinds of \\"audacious experiments\\" will peak their interest. Another fellow, Cristina Jiménez Moreta, is co-founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of groups led by immigrant youth. Moreta, 33, and her parents came to the U.S. illegally from Ecuador when she was a child. At 19, she revealed her undocumented status publicly. It was a move that put her and her family at risk of deportation, but also placed her at the forefront of a movement to change the way immigrants are perceived. She was instrumental in pressing for the 2012 adoption of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the now-endangered executive order that allowed thousands of undocumented young people to live without fear of deportation. Moreta said the fellowship is recognition of the resilience shown by her parents and other immigrants who \\"had the courage to stand up and say 'we are here, this is our home and we are fighting.'\\" The first people she told were her parents, who were fearful when she started organizing but now join her in marches and to pass petitions. \\"They're very proud,\\" she said. Also selected was Deyoud Bey, a photographer and educator from Chicago whose portraits often feature people from marginalized communities. For \\"The Birmingham Project,\\" he commemorated the 1963 bombing at a church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed six children, with a series of portraits of Birmingham residents who were the age of each of the children killed and the age they would be if they had lived.

Election Romney’s Advice To Students: Borrow Money From Your Parents CREDIT: If you’re young and you want to start your own business, Mitt Romney’s has some advice from you: Borrow money from your parents. At a “lecture” for students at Otterbein University in Ohio today, Mitt Romney told students that, his friend, Jimmy John, started a business by borrowing 20,000 from his parents at a low interest rate. Romney suggested anyone in the audience could do the same: This kind of devisiveness, this attack of success, is very different than what we’ve seen in our country’s history. We’ve always encouraged young people: Take a shot, go for it, take a risk, get the education, borrow money if you have to from your parents, start a business. Watch it: The advice fits right into the characterization that Romney is ‘out of touch’ with regular people. Most students don’t have parents with 20,000 in disposable capital sitting around to give to their kids to start a business. At least it’s more than Romney’s surrogates had to offer young people on their youth policy conference call this week. ||||| Jay Laprete/Getty Images WESTERVILLE, Ohio – This is the story of two John’s – Jimmy John’s and Papa John’s. Both have made it big in the fast food world. Mitt Romney, it turns out, has met both of them. And he likes their stories. Because their stories are a bit like his own (in some respects, anyway). They are entrepreneurs – and, usefully, they are emblems of the economic opportunity in America that Mr. Romney highlights in just about every campaign speech he delivers. On Friday afternoon here, Mr. Romney recounted their tales during a guest lecture to students at Otterbein University, a private liberal arts college in suburban Ohio. Mr. Romney started with Jimmy John, the founder of Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches. “He graduated from high school and he didn’t want to go to college,” Mr. Romney said. “And he said to his dad, can I borrow some money, I want to start a business.” His father was skeptical, but he loaned him 20,000. “The only thing that would work for 20,000 was a sandwich shop, so he started making sandwiches,” Mr. Romney said. The rest, Mr. Romney said, is more or less history. His outfit went national. “His sandwiches are doing pretty well,” Mr. Romney said, chuckling. Mr. Romney encouraged the students in the room to follow Mr. John’s path. “Take, take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money if you have to from your parents. Start a business.” This led, naturally, to the second John. “The other night I was with, another restaurant guy, Papa John,” Mr. Romney said. He did not say how the two had met, but given Mr. Romney’s heavy schedule of fundraisers these days, there is a strong chance it was at one of them. “I think he said it was in 1966 he opened his first pizza restaurant and today employs thousands of people,” Mr. Romney said. “We welcome that. We celebrate that in this country. It’s one of the reasons we are the nation we are.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Mitt Romney, during a lecture at Otterbein University in Ohio, advised students to consider borrowing money from their parents to start a business, using examples of successful entrepreneurs like Jimmy John and Papa John.

Fact 2: If there is an increase in UV radiation, the risks go up for all types of skin cancer. Given the two facts above, the risks of all types of skin cancer increases with increasing? Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts above, the risks of all types of skin cancer increase with increasing ozone depletion. Allow me to elaborate further on this connection and its implications. Ozone depletion refers to the gradual decline of ozone concentration in the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer, which is caused primarily by the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) into the atmosphere. The ozone layer acts as Earth's natural sunscreen, absorbing and blocking the majority of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. When the ozone layer is depleted, more UV radiation reaches the Earth's surface, which can have numerous detrimental effects on both human health and the environment. One of the most significant consequences of increased UV radiation is the higher risk of developing various types of skin cancer. Skin cancer is primarily caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun, with the three main types being basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. Each of these skin cancers has its distinct characteristics, but all can potentially lead to serious health issues if left untreated. The risks associated with developing skin cancer rise with increased exposure to UV radiation, which occurs when the ozone layer is compromised. UV radiation can not only cause direct damage to the DNA in skin cells, leading to mutations and increased risk of skin cancer, but it can also weaken the immune system and impair the body's ability to detect and repair damaged cells. This further exacerbates the risk of developing skin cancer. Moreover, increased UV radiation influences other environmental factors, such as the climate and ecosystem. It can affect the temperature and weather patterns, leading to more intense heatwaves and droughts, which in turn, results in more prolonged sun exposure for people. This exposure, along with the reduced ozone layer protection, increases the likelihood of developing skin cancer. In conclusion, the risks of all types of skin cancer increase with increasing ozone depletion due to the higher levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. This highlights the importance of taking necessary precautions, such as using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding excessive sun exposure, as well as supporting global efforts to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting substances and protect the ozone layer for future generations."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

News article: The leader of the nation’s largest police organization issued an extraordinary statement Monday apologizing for the “historical mistreatment of communities of color” by police agencies. Speaking at the International Association of Chiefs of Police annual meeting in San Diego, Chief Terrence M. Cunningham of Massachusetts also called on police and the swelling number of protesters to work together to break “this historic cycle of mistrust” that has plagued relations between law enforcement and minority communities. >> Database has info on 383 police shootings in San Diego County Cunningham made his remarks at the General Assembly for the association, which has been meeting at the San Diego Convention Center since Saturday. It will wrap up its annual conference Tuesday. His apology on behalf of an organization that has a membership of more than 20,000 police officials comes at a fraught time of relations between law enforcement and local communities in the wake of controversial police shootings, most involving African-American men. The remarks were welcomed by local law enforcement leaders, but drew a mixed response from civil rights leaders at the forefront of recent protests in El Cajon over the Sept. 27 police shooting of Alfred Olango, who was black. The incident led to street protests in the East County city that are continuing. Dr. Andre Branch, president of the San Diego branch of the NAACP civil rights organization, said he was glad Cunningham appeared to be taking responsibility for what what Branch said were “horrific acts against people of color” historically by police departments. Yet he said such an apology was diluted because it was unclear what Cunningham was apologizing for, or for what period of time. “What specific action of the past is he referring to?” Branch said. “Excessive force? Illegal stops by law enforcement? Fatalities of African-Americans in police encounters? “One would want to know before we start jumping up and down and getting excited about an apology, is he referring to historical treatment of people of color as last week? Or last month? Or the last century?” Cunningham, the chief of Wellesley, Mass., also called on police critics to take steps to improve relations by not blaming officers who are currently serving for the mistakes and errors of the past. He said the questioning of police actions has undermined trust between cops and communities. He then referred both to the hard and honorable work of police — “a noble profession” — and acknowledged “the history of policing has also had darker periods.” He said police have been required to carry out discriminatory laws and policies, and too often have become what Cunningham called “the face of oppression” to non-white communities nationally.That built a generational history of mistrust, he said. He called for a change in that dynamic in the future — then issued an apology. “For our part, the first step in this process is for law enforcement and the IACP to acknowledge and apologize for the actions of the past and the role that our profession has played in society’s historical mistreatment of communities of color,” he said..”At the same time, those who denounce the police must also acknowledge that today’s officers are not to blame for the injustices of the past. If either side in this debate fails to acknowledge these fundamental truths, we will be unlikely to move past them.” His remarks were greeted with applause inside the convention center hall where he spoke. In a statement, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said the comments were insightful and thought-provoking. “We, in law enforcement must acknowledge that we were the face of many discriminatory laws passed at all levels of government,” he said. “It should also be recognized these laws do not exist any longer, and the police officers of today are not responsible for the injustices of yesterday.” The Rev. Shane Harris, president of the National Action Network in San Diego that had been at the forefront of protests over the Olango shooting, said Cunningham’s statement was significant. “It’s a game-changer in policing,” he said. “It’s a huge step for someone of his caliber and leadership of that organization. I hope that what he has said will spark the nerve and the guts of other chiefs and police unions to admit there is an issue in policing today.” On the same day Cunningham spoke, the NAACP filed a lawsuit in federal court against El Cajon police and the Sheriff’s Department for violating the free speech rights of 14 protesters when they broke up demonstrations over the Olango shooting. Olango, 38, was shot four times and Tasered once by two El Cajon officers in a taco shop parking lot. Police were called by family members who said Olango was acting strangely. They fired when he assumed a shooting stance and pointed a silver colored vaping device at them as they confronted him. The shooting, captured on videotape, remains under investigation. In a statement about Cunningham’s remarks, San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman said, \\"The best way for our country to improve community police relations is to acknowledge our past, gain a better understanding of each others’ viewpoints, and find a common path forward for better relationships.\\" Twitter: @gregmoran greg.moran@sduniontribune.com ||||| (CNN) The head of a major international law enforcement organization on Monday apologized for \\"the actions of the past and the role that our profession has played in society's historical mistreatment of communities of color.\\" International Association of Chiefs of Police President, Terrence M. Cunningham, struck a conciliatory tone, acknowledging the deep-seated, generational mistrust between minorities and the police. Cunningham, speaking at a meeting of the group in San Diego, said law enforcement's history is \\"replete with examples of bravery, self-sacrifice and service to the community.\\" But Cunningham said at the same, \\"the history of policing has had darker periods.\\" \\"There have been times when law enforcement officers because of the laws enacted by federal, state and local governments have been the face of oppression to far too many of our fellow citizens. In the past, the laws adopted by our society have required police officers to perform many unpalatable tasks, such as ensuring legalized discrimination or even denying the basic rights of citizenship to many of our fellow Americans,\\" Cunningham said. Apology 'the first step' Cunningham, chief of police in Wellesley, Massachusetts, added: \\"We must forge a path that allows us to move beyond our history and identify common solutions to better protect our communities. For our part, the first step in this process is for the law enforcement profession and the IACP to acknowledge and apologize for the actions of the past and the role that our profession has played in society's historical mistreatment of communities of color.\\" Cunningham's remarks come at a tense moment in the history of relations between law enforcement and many communities across the United States. Activists and others have decried the shooting of unarmed black men at the hands of police. Protests have erupted in cities such as Ferguson, Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago and elsewhere over shooting deaths. Names such as Philando Castile, a black man fatally shot in a traffic stop in July in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Walter Scott, another black man shot by a police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, have become rallying cries for those who say police reform is needed. Words 'meaningless' if nothing changes Police body cam videos and cell phone videos have captured some of these deaths, or the aftermath. Cunningham's remarks were met with praise, but also acknowledgment that this is just the first step. In a tweet, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said: \\"Some next steps: require anti-bias training; discipline officers who engage in bias policing.\\" Good 1st step.

Sharpton's hope is that Cunningham \\"will urge officers around the United States to back his words up with action and legislation to protect communities of color from the onslaught of police misconduct that has disturbed the country.\\" He said \\"this dark side of our shared history has created a generational, almost inherited mistrust\\" between many communities of color and the police officers who serve them. \\"Many officers who do not share this common heritage often struggle to comprehend the reasons behind this historic mistrust,\\" Cunningham said. \\"As a result, they're often unable to bridge this gap and connect with some segments of their communities.\\" Cunningham, whose association has more than 23,000 members in 98 countries, noted \\"those who denounce the police must also acknowledge that today's officers are not to blame for the injustices of the past.\\" \\"Overcoming this historic mistrust requires that we must move forward together in an atmosphere of mutual respect,\\" said Cunningham. \\"All members of our society must realize that we have a mutual obligation to work together to ensure fairness, dignity, security and justice.\\" On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey told police chiefs at the same association's convention that those who think there is an epidemic of shootings of black people aren't well-informed. FBI chief: We need more accurate information Comey touched on a theme he has pursued for more than a year: trying to get law enforcement to embrace the need to report statistics on officer-involved shootings. Comey argued that better numbers would help the nation understand whether there is an epidemic of police killings of black men -- or if the advent of viral videos shared in social media is giving the impression there are more lethal confrontations between police and minorities. \\"A small group of videos serve as an epidemic\\" Comey argued Sunday. The FBI is trying to change that, recently announcing a pilot program to collect numbers from police departments in 2017. On Monday, the FBI chief tempered his earlier remarks. \\"I'm not trying to debunk anything, except to say I hope all of us want actual information about what's going on, whatever that will show.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The leader of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Terrence M. Cunningham, has apologised for the historical mistreatment of communities of colour by law enforcement agencies and has called on police and protesters to work together to break “this historic cycle of mistrust.” His remarks were welcomed by some civil rights leaders, but criticised by others for being insufficiently specific. The apology comes at a time of intense tension between police and communities following the recent controversial deaths of African-American men during police shootings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In the book, what kind of negative emotion did the southern Caucasians feel? Context: The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed \\"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\\"","completion":"In the book, the kind of negative emotion that the southern Caucasians felt was \\"the spirit-corroding shame\\" in their treatment of the African Americans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joel had high anxiety about a visit from Leslie, so Pick your answer from: -- Joel breathed deeply to relax. -- Leslie breathed deeply to relax.","completion":"Joel had high anxiety about a visit from Leslie, so Joel breathed deeply to relax. This reaction was not only natural but also an essential coping mechanism to deal with his nervousness. Controlling his breathing helped Joel to focus on the present moment, calm his racing thoughts, and prevent feelings of being overwhelmed. By engaging in deep inhalations and exhalations, Joel increased the oxygen flow to his brain and activated his body's relaxation response, which in turn helped to ease his tension, reduce his heart rate, and stabilize his blood pressure. This mindfulness technique is known as diaphragmatic breathing, and it is a highly effective tool for self-regulation in managing stress and anxiety. By mastering it successfully, Joel found the inner strength to face Leslie's visit and make the most of their time together. He was able to maintain a positive attitude, effectively communicate, and actively listen to what Leslie had to say, all while staying fully present in their conversations. In addition to deep breathing, there are several other methods Joel could have tried to reduce his anxiety levels. For instance, he might have chosen to exercise beforehand, as physical activity is known to release endorphins and promote an overall sense of well-being. Moreover, spending time with loved ones or engaging in fun activities could have played a crucial role in boosting his confidence and alleviating his anxious feelings. Similarly, proper nutrition and hydration, along with good sleep habits, can go a long way in managing anxiety. Joel could also have benefited from discussing his concerns with a therapist or counselor in order to identify the underlying causes and receive guidance on the best coping strategies. Furthermore, practicing self-compassion and acceptance would have allowed him to accept the presence of anxiety and ultimately loosen its grip over his emotions. As Joel continued to develop his stress-relief toolkit, he began to feel more comfortable and confident about facing the challenges life threw at him, including Leslie's visits. Over time, he learned to embrace the complex emotions he experienced and took responsibility for maintaining his mental well-being proactively. This empowered him to create deep connections with others, establish healthy boundaries, and fully participate in the highs and lows that relationships entail. Therefore, in this scenario, Joel breathing deeply to relax was a critical first step in addressing his high anxiety about Leslie's visit. This allowed him to focus on strengthening his emotional resilience, which led to better relationships, improved mental health, and an overall enhanced quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lyngby culture is a term used to describe a culture that was located in which region? A:","completion":"The Lyngby culture is a term used to describe a prehistoric culture that was located in the region of present-day Denmark, specifically the area around Lyngby, which is a northern suburb of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. This culture thrived during the Mesolithic period, which roughly spans from 9300 to 4000 BCE in this region. The Lyngby culture is named after the site at Lyngby where many artifacts and remains from this time period have been discovered. The term \\"culture\\" here refers to the distinct patterns of behavior, beliefs, and material culture (artifacts, tools, and other physical evidence) exhibited by the people who lived in this area during this time. One of the key distinguishing features of the Lyngby culture was its reliance on marine resources, such as fish and shellfish, as well as terrestrial game. This is in contrast to earlier European cultures that focused primarily on hunting large game animals. The people in the Lyngby culture also likely engaged in some form of small-scale agriculture and/or horticulture, although this would have played a secondary role in their subsistence strategy. From an archaeological perspective, the Lyngby culture is known for its distinctive tool assemblage, which includes a variety of stone and organic (bone, antler) projectile points, knives, scrapers, and other tools that reflect the shift towards a more diversified subsistence strategy. These artifacts were carefully crafted and often exhibited exquisite craftsmanship, suggesting a high level of skill and knowledge among the people who created them. Besides these material aspects, the Lyngby culture also likely had its own unique set of beliefs, rituals, and social organization, although these are less well-documented and more difficult to reconstruct from the archaeological record. Nevertheless, it is likely that the people of the Lyngby culture lived in small, relatively mobile groups, which allowed them to exploit the changing availability of resources in their environment and maintain a sustainable lifestyle. In summary, the Lyngby culture was a prehistoric culture located in the region of present-day Denmark, specifically around the area of modern-day Lyngby. It thrived during the Mesolithic period and is notable for its reliance on marine resources and a diversified subsistence strategy. The Lyngby culture is also characterized by its distinctive tool assemblage and high level of craftsmanship, as well as its unique set of beliefs and social organization, which reflect the adaptations and innovations that allowed these people to thrive in their environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: There are many medications, both over the counter and prescription, that can help relieve nasal congestion in your sinuses. Flonase and Nasacort are nasal steroid sprays that are available over-the-counter. To use, administer one spray per nostril, once or twice daily. This is especially helpful if you have allergies. You may also try Zyrtec, which is a non-drowsy antihistamine, which can reduce sinus congestion. Take 10 mg once a day. Also try Claritin, another non-drowsy antihistamine that may work well for you. Take 10 mg once a day. Oral decongestants that include pseudoephedrine may also be helpful. If the over the counter doses don't work for you, talk to your doctor about stronger version of these medications or other, prescription only decongestants that may work better for your case. OTC pain medications for the pain associated with sinus congestion, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, may also help. Nasal decongestants, such as Afrin, can quickly reduce sinus congestion, but should only be used for three days. If you use them longer, you may get rebound symptoms. Pregnant women or people with medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid disease should not use these medications without talking to their doctor. And talk to your child's doctor before giving them to children. If you have severe chronic allergies that cause your sinus issues, consider immunotherapy to eliminate your sinus congestion. Immunotherapy is the process by which you are administered small doses of what you are allergic to, such as pollen, mold, or pet dander, either by injections or under the tongue. The first step is to get tested by an allergist, who will figure out exactly what you are allergic to. Once your doctor has confirmed what you are allergic to, he or she will begin to administer the allergen as injections or under your tongue. The doctor gives you doses of the allergen with the idea that your body will learn to adapt to the allergen, no longer see it as an invader, and no longer continue to mount an immune response, such as the sinus congestion or a runny nose. The injections or treatments will take place weekly for the first four to six months. Next, you should be at the maintenance level and require treatment every two to four weeks. Gradually you will go longer and longer between treatments until you only need them once a month. After one year, if you have responded to therapy, you will have either no symptoms or be much improved and your treatments can continue for three to five years, when you should be completely immune to the allergen. If you haven't responded, the immunotherapy will be terminated. This treatment is time consuming and can be expensive, but many people are turning to this therapy because it removes their sinus congestion and improves their quality of life. There are certain situations when a doctor may be needed. If you have had symptoms of a head cold for more than two weeks, you should see your doctor to check for a larger issue such as a bacterial infection. If there is a change from your usual allergy secretions and symptoms for a week, it is reasonable to seek treatment if you are worsening on day seven instead of improving. Occasionally, sinus congestion can lead to a bacterial sinus infection, and your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic at that time. Sinus surgery is rarely needed for chronic sinus congestion or infections. If you are bleeding from your sinuses, if your sinus congestion is associated with headaches that are severe or with high fevers, confusion, neck stiffness, or weakness, or if any symptom increases after the use of any home remedy, see your doctor immediately. Drainage from sinus congestion can trigger symptoms in people with asthma or other lung problems. See your doctor right away if you have a cough, wheezing, chest pain, or shortness of breath associated with your sinus congestion. Summary:","completion":"Nasal congestion can be relieved using various over-the-counter and prescription medications. Over-the-counter options include Flonase, Nasacort, Zyrtec, Claritin, oral decongestants, and pain medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Nasal decongestants like Afrin can be used for up to three days. Consult a doctor before using these medications if pregnant or having certain medical conditions, and for children. Immunotherapy can be a long-term solution for chronic allergies causing sinus problems. See a doctor if symptoms worsen, last over two weeks, or are accompanied by other concerning symptoms like bleeding, severe headache, or breathing difficulties. Sinus surgery is rarely needed, and antibiotics may be prescribed if a bacterial infection is present."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals.

Birds of a Feather actress Linda Robson has revealed how her son's mental health deteriorated after witnessing the fatal stabbing of his best friend Ben Kinsella. Louis, now 22, was holding 16-year-old Ben, brother of former EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella, in his arms when the ambulance arrived after the attack outside a bar in Islington, London, in 2008. Now, his mother has opened up on how the death of Ben affected Louis, and how she was told by a doctor that he needed to be sectioned. Tragedy: Linda Robson's son Louis was best friends with Ben Kinsella and present when the 16-year-old was stabbed to death in 2008, an event which sent Louis into a spiral of depression, anxiety and panic attacks. Linda Robson's son and Ben Kinsella had been best friends since the age of eight, and it was Louis who called the ambulance and tried to stem the bleeding with his cardigan after Ben was stabbed 11 times outside a bar in Islington six years ago. ‘Louis went back to Ben. He was holding him in his arms on the floor,' Linda told the Daily Mail in 2011. 'Eventually they put him in an ambulance. Louis’s clothes were covered in Ben’s blood so he had to take them off. ‘Life changed from that day. It never goes away. You think about it all the time. Louis was diagnosed with depression and dropped out of college, but his best friend's death had affected him so profoundly that he began suffering panic attacks. Long way back: Linda and Louis, pictured on stage with Pauline Quirke, her son Charlie and Lesley Joseph in 2012, struggled in the years after Ben Kinsella's death. Murdered: Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death outside an Islington bar in 2008. In 2013, Louis began living like 'a recluse' as his anxiety crippled him and his family. 'Me or my husband had to be around him all the time,' Linda told The Mirror. 'We couldn't go out - he'd panic if we weren't there.' A year later, Linda and her husband Mark visited a Harley Street doctor for help handling Louis' illness, and were told their son needed sectioning. 'The doctor said Louis needed to be locked up, send away and put on medication for a month.' Linda and Mark did not take up the offer, and instead sought alternative anxiety therapy for their son, who is now recovered and working on a music career. Star pupil and promising artist Ben Kinsella was stabbed 11 times in an Islington street after a night out celebrating the end of his GCSEs with a groups of friends, including Louis, in 2008.

As people age, the risk of developing heart-related issues such as atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease increases. The elasticity of blood vessels decreases with age, leading to high blood pressure, which is another risk factor for CVDs. Furthermore, as people get older, their bodies may not efficiently process nutrients, affecting heart health. Second, lifestyle habits can influence the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Population A, from countries like Japan and Russia, may have adopted unhealthy habits, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and poor diet, which increase the risk of CVDs. Though these habits may also be present among population B, they are generally less prevalent due to strict regulations and wider public health awareness campaigns promoting healthy lifestyles. Third, socioeconomic factors can affect the overall health and propensity for CVDs in both populations. Developing countries with younger populations (population B) may face economic challenges, limiting access to healthcare and other resources. However, these countries might also benefit from allocation of resources and more progressive policies that focus on preventive care and early detection of health issues. This can potentially help mitigate some risks associated with cardiovascular diseases. Despite the fact that population B is less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases, CVDs remain a global health concern. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage both populations to adopt healthy lifestyles, enforce public health policies, and raise awareness about the importance of regular health check-ups to minimize the risk of CVDs. In summary, population B, with its younger demographic profile, is less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases in comparison to population A, which represents late adulthood. Factors such as age, lifestyle habits, and socioeconomic factors contribute to this difference in risk. Regardless, it is essential for both populations to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce the prevalence of CVDs and improve overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nerve, then Stella and finally Toby A:","completion":"Title: The Unbroken Vow Genre: Drama/Romantic Comedy Plot: Act 1: The Past The movie opens with a series of flashbacks introducing the complicated relationships between the four main characters: Josh, Nerve, Stella, and Toby. Josh, the seemingly perfect groom, has been friends with Nerve since childhood. At the same time, Josh had a close relationship with Stella, an exceptionally talented singer who shares a deep love for music with him. While growing up, Josh and Stella had always felt a special connection, but due to circumstances, they never pursued a romantic relationship. On the other hand, Toby is Josh's fun-loving, happy-go-lucky roommate from college who has always been there for him through thick and thin. Act 2: The Wedding Reception In the present day, Josh is getting married to his beautiful fiancée, Sara. It's a picturesque wedding, and they're about to cut the cake during the reception when Josh receives a mysterious note that triggers a sudden realization; he needs to make peace with his past before he can truly embrace his future. Act 3: The Journey Josh decides to leave the wedding reception, embarking on a quest to say his goodbyes and find closure with Nerve, Stella, and Toby. First, Josh tracks down Nerve, a once-promising athlete who had a falling out with Josh several years ago due to Nerve's drug addiction. Nerve has now successfully completed rehab and is turning his life around. In an emotional confrontation, they reconcile, and Nerve sincerely apologizes for their past issues. He also wishes Josh well in his new life as a married man. Next, Josh visits Stella, who has since become a famous singer. She is in the middle of a performance, and despite the timing, Josh manages to catch her attention.

Josh offers his apology for not pursuing a relationship with her and not giving their love a chance. Stella forgives him and wishes him happiness in his marriage. Lastly, Josh goes to Toby, who has recently lost his job and is coping with the hardship. Toby never knew about Josh's journeys to find closure, but he has always admired Josh's compassion. After sharing a vulnerable conversation, the two solidify their bond as best friends, and Josh promises to help him find a new job and regain his footing. Act 4: Coming Home With all goodbyes said, Josh returns to the wedding reception, where Sara has been understandingly waiting for him.

The film follows the interwoven perspectives of the grieving family and friends as they grapple with these unexpected revelations and ultimately unite to solve the mystery surrounding George's death. Act 1: A Hasty Farewell The film opens with George (our main protagonist), a renowned businessman, wrapping up a major deal, which he believes will be his crowning achievement. Unbeknownst to him, his health is rapidly declining due to an overworked heart. At the celebration dinner, George engages in laughter and drinks, showcasing a seemingly happy and fulfilled life. However, as the excitement mounts, George suddenly collapses onto the floor, suffering from a massive heart attack and ultimately passes away. The shockwave of disarray spreads through George's family and circle of friends, putting the spotlight on the strained relationships between his wife, Michelle, his brother, Jack, and his best friend, Peter. As they prepare George's funeral, his long-hidden business partner, Sarah, arrives on the scene, leading to further confusion in an already chaotic situation. Act 2: Six Feet Under Lies Upon Sarah's introduction to the tangled web that was George's life, she shares news of his business ventures, which involve controversial dealings.

Michelle divulges that she was aware of George's affairs throughout their marriage, but chose to stay silent to preserve their reputation and protect their children's interests. Act 3: Unveiling Truths In their frantic search to understand the circumstances leading up to George's untimely death, Jack and Peter stumble upon a coercive underground deal involving George and a rival company. This encounter reveals that George was being blackmailed into compliance, which ultimately led to a substantial increase in his stress levels and contributed to his fatal heart attack.

The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to... Now, I have a new situation: David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them. Answer this question please: Would case B show less or more developed pheromone chemical signal than case A? Answer:","completion":"Case B would likely show less developed pheromone chemical signals than case A, as case A refers to ants which are known to have more developed pheromone communication systems as compared to other hymenopteran groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance! The daughter and parent probably think that: - the manager is doing a great job - not enough information - the service at the restaurant is terrible - the restaurant will be a hit in the neighborhood A:","completion":"The daughter and parent probably think that the service at the restaurant is terrible. Here's the thought process: 1. The restaurant was empty, which suggested it was not a popular place. 2. Although the manager was present, there was no server to attend to them and they had to wait for 10 minutes. 3. The waitress who eventually showed up pushed the customers aside to prioritize changing her clothes, indicating unprofessional behavior. 4. The manager asked the customers to move from their table, even though the special group never arrived, which showed poor judgment and management. 5. They were led to an undesirable table near the restroom. 6. The waitress took a long time to take their order and the food never arrived within a reasonable amount of time. 7. The restaurant closed shortly after their visit, suggesting it was not successful. In this scenario, the daughter and parent likely think the service at the restaurant is terrible and that it deserved to close. Their experience with unprofessional staff, lack of organization, and slow service led to a negative perception of the restaurant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In this case, the direct effect happens on \\"The spores germinate.\\" Step 4: Determine the consequences of the perturbation on the subsequent steps. - If spore germination is decreased, the number of Hyphae formed will also decrease. - As fewer Hyphae form, there will be fewer instances of multiple Hyphae meeting and converging. - With fewer converging Hyphae, the number of Mycelium structures formed will be reduced. - As a result, there will be fewer hyphal knots forming in the ground. Step 5: Assess whether the perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process. In this case, the freeze has a direct effect on spore germination, which in turn has indirect effects on the formation of Hyphae, the convergence of Hyphae, Mycelium formation, and hyphal knot formation in the ground. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation of a freeze decreasing spore germination has an indirect effect on more hyphal knots forming in the ground due to the chain of consequences stemming from the initial direct effect on spore germination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Permian all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era.

Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which event happened first, the publishing of Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism, or the 2003 study by Israeli demographer Shaul Stampfer?","completion":"Title: Tracing Chronological Antecedents: The Precedence of Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism and the 2003 Study by Shaul Stampfer Introduction In the realm of historical and demographic research, events and discoveries shape our understanding of the human experience and contribute to the ever-expanding field of knowledge. In this article, we delve into two key events: the publishing of \\"Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism\\" and a 2003 study by Israeli demographer Shaul Stampfer. By unraveling the chronological sequence of both event occurrences, we seek to provide insights into the relationship between these elements and how they contribute to our understanding of the history of antisemitism and Jewish demography. Overview: \\"Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism\\" \\"Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism\\" is a comprehensive historical account that documents the many manifestations of antisemitism from its origins to the present day. The book explores the pervasive presence and evolution of antisemitism throughout history, uncovering the various facets of this timeless prejudice that has persisted for over 23 centuries. This remarkable work has significantly contributed towards widening the readers' comprehension of antisemitism and its deep-seated roots in human culture. Overview: Shaul Stampfer's 2003 Study Shaul Stampfer, a renowned Israeli scholar and demographer, conducted a research study in 2003 that aimed to shed light on the Jewish demographic trends and their impact on society. By examining various historical data and employing cutting-edge methodologies in demographic analysis, his study offers crucial insights into the growth and decline of Jewish populations and how this information can inform our understanding of historical events and contemporary societal shifts. Which Occurred First? To reveal the sequential order in which the publication of \\"Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism\\" and Shaul Stampfer's 2003 study took place, we must draw attention to the respective publication dates. \\"Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism,\\" authored by the acclaimed historian and scholar Léon Poliakov, was first published in French under the title “De l’antisionisme à l’antisémitisme” in 1965. It traces the historical progression of antisemitism from ancient times to the mid-20th century, highlighting not just the impact of the prejudice but also the forces that shaped and exacerbated its manifestation. In English, it was later published as \\"The History of Anti-Semitism\\" in four volumes, each addressing a specific period in history. In contrast, Shaul Stampfer's comprehensive study on Jewish demography was conducted and published in 2003, long after Poliakov's groundbreaking work. The study, spearheaded by Stampfer, provided critical information on the fluctuations in Jewish populations worldwide and highlighted the potential causes behind these shifts. Conclusion In light of the publication dates, it is evident that \\"Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism\\" by Léon Poliakov was published before the 2003 study by Israeli demographer Shaul Stampfer. With a gap of almost four decades between both events, Poliakov's work on antisemitism laid a solid foundation for understanding the historical and social implications of this deeply ingrained prejudice. While both events share distinct thematic universes, the precedence of Poliakov's work allowed for a more profound understanding of the cultural and historical factors that contributed to the systemic discrimination against Jews. In turn, Shaul Stampfer's 2003 study provided new insights into the Jewish demographic history that enriched and complemented Poliakov's work by assessing the population shifts and their intricate connections with broader historical and cultural contexts. Together, these two milestones contribute to the ongoing scholarship in the fields of antisemitism and Jewish demography by offering invaluable knowledge that continues to inform contemporary discourses and academic pursuits."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Sutton rounded the keeper to score from a tight angle on 51 minutes. And Morgan finished calmly from a breakaway eight minutes from time as the home side were chasing the game. The opening goal also came on a break, with experienced striker Sutton cracking the offside trap with a run timed to perfection. He was one-on-one with Greg Fleming and, despite being forced wide, managed to force the ball home. There followed a nervous period with both sides clearly petrified to put a foot wrong but the mood among the large visiting support was calmed with Morgan's strike. Again Ayr were caught short in defence, this time in a four versus two situation and Morgan stroked in the finish at Fleming's left post. St Mirren were the better team and were busy in the United area but only once created a clear-cut shot in the first half which forced a save from Fleming and it was a spectacular one too. Stevie Mallan's strike was net-bound until the Ayr goalie launched himself across his goal. The urgency of the situation was clearly not lost on the St Mirren support. They contributed 1,244 paying customers in an attendance of 2,714 - making up almost half the crowd. There is still huge work to be done for Saints but they did look a re-energised side.

How do you do this: how do I make a messy hair bun?","completion":"Step 1: Prepare your hair Before creating a messy hair bun, it's important to ensure your hair is in the right condition for styling. This means it's best to work with day-old hair, as it will have more texture and grip, making it easier to style. If your hair is freshly washed and too smooth, you can use a texturizing spray or dry shampoo to add texture. Step 2: Gather your hair into a ponytail To begin the messy hair bun, use your fingers to gather all of your hair into a loose ponytail at the desired height of the bun. You can make a low bun at the nape of your neck or a higher one on the crown, depending on your personal preference. Remember not to pull or smooth the hair too much, as you want it to maintain its messiness. Step 3: Twist your hair Next, lightly twist your ponytail around itself to create a loose coil. It's important not to twist too tightly, as this will reduce the desired messy effect. Step 4: Wrap the twisted hair Wrap your twisted hair around the base of the ponytail to create a messy bun shape. You can wrap your hair in any direction you like – there's no hard and fast rule, as the goal is to make it look effortless and messy. Step 5: Secure the bun Use bobby pins or hairpins to connect the end of your twisted hair to the base, ensuring it's secure. Insert the pins at different angles to create a more irregular and messy appearance. You can also use a hair tie to secure the bun, then use bobby pins to adjust the shape as needed. Step 6: Add volume and messiness Now it's time to add volume and messiness to your bun. Gently tug and pull at a few loose strands of hair around the bun to create an even more textured and lived-in look. You can also pull out a few face-framing pieces to soften the style. Step 7: Final touches To complete the messy hair bun, you can add a bit of hairspray for added hold or use more texturizing spray to achieve even more texture. Alternatively, you can leave it as-is for a more natural look. And there you have it—a simple and effortless messy hair bun!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"The man in the red sleeveless shirt is waving to a young girl,\\" introduces additional information that is not found in the premise. This new information includes the presence of a young girl as well as the interaction (waving) between the man and the girl. The premise does not inform us whether the hypothesis is true or false because it does not contain any information related to the man waving or the existence of a young girl in the scene.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the band member who left the Smashing Pumpkins in 2009? The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released...

Guidelines and steps: 1. Understand the words: - \\"Tambor\\" is a character's name from Disney's Bambi movie. - \\"É divertido, não é?\\" is a question that means is it fun, isn't it? - \\"Bambi\\" is another character's name. 2. Apply your knowledge of both Portuguese and Japanese to translate each section of the sentence. 3. Since names do not require translation, \\"Tambor\\" and \\"Bambi\\" should remain as they are. 4. The phrase \\"É divertido, não é?\\" translates to \\"それは楽しいですね?\\" in Japanese. 5. So, the full sentence translated into Japanese should be \\"タンボール:それは楽しいですね、バンビ?\\" Note: Translation may slightly vary based on the context. The translation above is considering \\"Tambor\\" and \\"Bambi\\" to be the direct names of whomever being addressed. The phrasing may change based on nuances and context of the dialogue.

Question: Information: - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971. The musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It highlights political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible narratives. - Slowhand is a 1977 album by Eric Clapton. Released on 25 November by RSO Records, and titled after Clapton's nickname, it is one of his commercially and critically most successful studio albums. \\"Slowhand\\" produced the two hit singles \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary. - \`\` Wonderful Tonight '' is a ballad written by Eric Clapton . It was included on Clapton 's 1977 album Slowhand . Clapton wrote the song about Pattie Boyd . The female vocal harmonies on the song are provided by Marcella Detroit ( then Marcy Levy ) and Yvonne Elliman . - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - \\"Lay Down Sally\\" is a song performed by Eric Clapton, and written by Clapton, Marcella Detroit (as Marcy Levy, the diminutive form of her birth name), and George Terry. It appeared on his November 1977 album \\"Slowhand\\", and reached No. 3 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Marcella Detroit (born Marcella Levy, June 21, 1952) is an American soprano vocalist (perhaps best known for her backup singing on many Top 20 Billboard hits), guitarist, and songwriter. She released her debut album \\"Marcella\\" in 1982 to little success before she joined Shakespears Sister with ex-Bananarama member Siobhan Fahey. Detroit sang the lead vocals on their biggest hit, \\"Stay\\", which was number one in the United Kingdom for eight consecutive weeks. Since leaving the band in 1993, Detroit has maintained a successful solo career, and from 2002 to 2007 fronted her own self-titled blues band. - Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour, and sprawls towards the Blue Mountains to the west. Residents of Sydney are known as \\"Sydneysiders\\". Sydney is the second official seat and second official residence of the Governor-General of Australia and the Prime Minister of Australia and many federal ministries maintain substantial presences in Sydney. - Eric Patrick Clapton, (born 1945), is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton ranked second in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" and fourth in Gibson's \\"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\\". He was also named number five in \\"Time\\" magazine's list of \\"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\\" in 2009. - Patricia Anne \\"Pattie\\" Weston (née Boyd) (born 17 March 1944) is an English model, photographer and author. She was the first wife of both George Harrison and Eric Clapton. In August 2007, she published her autobiography \\"\\". Her photographs of Harrison and Clapton, titled \\"Through the Eye of a Muse\\", have been exhibited in Dublin, Sydney, Toronto, Moscow, London, Almaty, and throughout the United States. - Bananarama are a British female pop music vocal group formed in London in 1979 by friends Sara Dallin, Siobhan Fahey and Keren Woodward. Their success on both pop and dance charts have earned them a listing in \\"The Guinness Book of Records\\" as the all-female group with the most chart entries in the world. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Yvonne Marianne Elliman (born December 29, 1951) is an American singer who performed for four years in the first cast of \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\". She scored a number of hits in the 1970s and achieved a US #1 hit with \\"If I Can't Have You\\". After a long hiatus in the 1980s and 1990s, during which time she dedicated herself to her family, she made a comeback album as a singer-songwriter in 2004.

But all of this gets derailed, and Frank's life descends into an increasingly complex mess, from the minute a beautiful and seductive new patient named Susan Ivey comes to him, seeking a root canal and a little pain relief. On Susan's initial office visit, Frank schedules her for a root canal the very next day, and offers her some Ibuprofen to address her pain in the meanwhile. Claiming that she is allergic to the offered medication, Susan requests a prescription for the addictive pain-killer Demerol. Frank provides the prescription, but only for five tablets. However, Susan changes the dosage from five tablets to fifty when she collects the medication from her pharmacist. Susan arrives for her appointment twelve hours late, having mistaken the time. She seduces Frank, talking him into getting drunk and having sex with her. During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's narcotics. The next day, there is a DEA agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff under the influence of cocaine hydrochloride from a bottle registered to the dentist.

Read this: One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation prior to the 12th century is Sulami (d. 1021) without whose work the majority of very early Sufi commentaries would not have been preserved. Sulami's major commentary is a book named haqaiq al-tafsir (\\"Truths of Exegesis\\") which is a compilation of commentaries of earlier Sufis. From the 11th century onwards several other works appear, including commentaries by Qushayri (d. 1074), Daylami (d. 1193), Shirazi (d. 1209) and Suhrawardi (d. 1234). These works include material from Sulami's books plus the author's contributions. Many works are written in Persian such as the works of Maybudi (d. 1135) kash al-asrar (\\"the unveiling of the secrets\\"). Rumi (d. 1273) wrote a vast amount of mystical poetry in his book Mathnawi. Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in translations of Rumi's work. A large number of Quranic passages can be found in Mathnawi, which some consider a kind of Sufi interpretation of the Quran. Rumi's book is not exceptional for containing citations from and elaboration on the Quran, however, Rumi does mention Quran more frequently. Simnani (d. 1336) wrote two influential works of esoteric exegesis on the Quran. He reconciled notions of God's manifestation through and in the physical world with the sentiments of Sunni Islam. Comprehensive Sufi commentaries appear in the 18th century such as the work of Ismail Hakki Bursevi (d. 1725). His work ruh al-Bayan (the Spirit of Elucidation) is a voluminous exegesis. Written in Arabic, it combines the author's own ideas with those of his predecessors (notably Ibn Arabi and Ghazali), all woven together in Hafiz, a Persian poetry form.

They are fierce protectors, but they will walk through grass with morning dew on it and expect the keets to follow. They do, but getting wet is death to keets. Though a grown guinea can endure rain and snow and other insults, guinea keets are very delicate, so you will have to put in some work to raise them. Guineas sometimes will abandon a nest even after the hen has gotten broody and spent several nights sitting on the eggs. If you notice that a nest has been abandoned, move the eggs to an incubator right away. You can use a store-bought incubator, following the instructions for incubating turkey or pheasant eggs if no specific instructions are provided for guinea eggs. The incubation period is between 26 and 28 days. Once the keets hatch, you will need to care for them until they have fully developed feathers and are strong enough to hold their own with the rest of the flock. If you also raise chickens, a broody hen can be used to hatch the eggs and raise the keets. Turkeys can also make suitable replacement mothers. You will need to keep the keets contained in a box for the first six to eight weeks. A 16\\" x 28\\" box will provide enough space for about 15 keets. Keets are very delicate, so be sure to provide adequate space for them to prevent trampling. If they appear to be overcrowded, move them to a larger box. Keets can escape through very fine wire mesh, so it's best to keep them in a container with solid sides, like a sturdy cardboard box. They will be jumping in no time, so make sure you cover the box with a screen. Keep the box lined with clean paper towels for the first week or more, and then switch to wood shavings. They need a textured surface to prevent them from slipping and injuring their legs, so don't line the box with newspaper. Textured shelf liner, available at dollar stores, is a good substitute. Try this: Put a hand towel or cloth in a clothes dryer only long enough to get it warm. Then pick the keet up with the warm towel, loosely wrap it around the keet, and snuggle with the baby against your chest. Sometimes the sluggishness is just a sign that one keet needs more warmth than the others. Feed your keets a store bought food, crumbles rather than pellets, for the first couple of months. Use a starter mix for baby birds with 24% to 28% protein for the first five weeks, and then switch to a mixture containing 18% to 20% protein for the next three weeks. Check labels. Starter feeds for wild birds and turkeys tend to be higher in protein than starter mixes for chickens. If you run out of feed and can't get to a feed store right away, boil some eggs and feed the keets the yolks. Hand feed the keets to get them used to you. Be sure to provide your keets with a steady source of fresh, warm water. They don't tolerate cold water well. Newborn keets are susceptible to drowning, so provide water in a shallow bowl filled with marbles at first. The keets will climb on the marbles and drink the water between them. Very young keets will require some help at first, so tip each keet's beak briefly in the water to let them know how and where to drink. After the initial period, providing a jar of water with a watering base will be a great way to make sure they always have enough water to drink and that they never have enough water to drown in. Keets may get dried feces stuck to their feet or bottoms. This can cause a variety of complications, so be sure to clean them right away. To do so, wipe the area with a moist cotton ball or soak the area in warm soapy water. Be very gentle. Scraping or picking the feces off of the keets may cause injury. To prevent this from happening in the first place, make sure to change the lining in the box frequently.

The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal. What is an answer for this question: Which colleague studied less about the smooth neocortex of rats? A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's go through the given information step by step: 1.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Now, I have a new situation: Brad and Dale went to the doctor for a check up. Brad did some blood tests and found out he has very high cholesterol levels, while his partner Dale had normal cholesterol levels, and was very healthy. Brad got scared and started worrying.

When I was a boy growing up in New Jersey in the 1960s, we had a milkman delivering milk to our doorstep. His name was Mr. Basille. He wore a white cap and drove a white truck. Of course, he delivered more than milk. There was cheese, eggs and so on. If we needed to change our order, my mother would write a note -- \\"Please add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery\\". Then she put the note and the empty bottles into the milk box. The next day, the buttermilk would magically appear. There was also a close relationship between families and their milkmen. Mr. Basille even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box in the house, so that the milk wouldn't freeze. And I remember Mr. Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table, having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery. I am sad that there is no home milk delivery today. Big companies produce cheaper milk, and milk is for sale everywhere. People may not need the milkman anymore. Recently, I saw an old milk box in the countryside and it brought back my childhood memories. I took it home and put it outside the door. My son's friends always ask what it is.

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a bungalow on the Bartok facility's property. He also...

Dementia sufferer Anne Grimshaw, 78, has been fitted with a tracking device nicknamed a ‘SatNan’ because she gets lost so often when out walking. Scroll down for video. Anne Grimshaw (right), who has dementia, has been given a tracking device which allows her daughter, Joanne Taylor (left), to find her if she gets lost. The transmitter, known as a Buddi, is attached to her keys and sends out an update on her position every five minutes. If she wanders too far from her. bungalow in Rochdale, or suffers a fall, her daughter receives a phone. call from the Buddi team. Mrs Taylor said the device, supplied by. Rochdale Council’s assisted technology department, had enabled the. great-grandmother to retain her independence rather than having to be. put in a home. ‘The police once brought her home when. she was found on the hard shoulder of the motorway. She doesn’t think. there is anything wrong but she gets completely lost. Ms Taylor says that the device has allowed her mother to avoid having to move into a nursing home. Before they had the device, Ms Taylor says she would have to go out looking for her mother up to five times a day. The black box is attached to Mrs Grimshaw's keys and, as well as tracking her location, it can alert her daughter if she falls over or strays outside a certain area. ‘One day she went missing for 12 hours and caused a massive police search. We live near the moors and I was sick with worry.’ Mrs Taylor says others should consider a tracking device for their relatives. ‘There are thousands in my position whose lives would be changed if they knew about Buddi.’ Before she had the tracking device, Mrs Grimshaw (left) was found by police on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway. ‘We live near the moors and I was sick with worry, I can't put into words how I felt, I was really worked up and just kept crying, I thought the worse. She would even try and go out in the snow,’ she said. Following this incident, a desperate Ms Taylor began researching ways to track her mother - in particular she was looking for a mobile phone with a tracking app - and she came across Buddi. Ms Taylor said the system worked ‘in the nick of time’. She explained: ‘My mother’s independence is key to her and I think your independence is just about everything to you especially if you can live in your own home and be in your own surroundings. ‘But you have got to be safe at the same time. I know my mum would hate being in a home and I believe she would have deteriorated. If she didn't have this it would be really dangerous.’ She added: ‘I can't fault Buddi.

Text: a prerequisite to this tifu would be to know that i have some moderate athsma, it usually doesn't act up unless i have a cold or something sim millar though. this happened in the winter of 2017. so i had taken a week of work to go see my family, and i decided bringing everyone skiing out of the country. being pretty cheap, i wasn't really looking for quality in the hotel we were staying at. so after a couple of hours of searching, i found a pretty good deal on a hotel. additionally, it had a free spa that we could use. fast forward a couple days, my family and i had finished skiing and i thought it would be a fantastic idea to use the free spa in the hotel. so we change into our swimsuits and go to the spa, which quite disappointedly was just a mediocre looking hot tub. it also had a very strong sent of chlorine. but whatever. for a couple minutes i relaxed in the 'spa' and let it warm me up, untill i felt a small hard pebble like object on my foot. i knelt over and picked it up, getting my hair wet in the process. it was a small white powdery tablet, which seemed to slowly dissolving into the tub. i looked around and saw more. i began to pick each of them up and set them behind me; they seemed to total about 15. when i was picking up the last few, i also realized that they didn't seem to be disolving anymore. i left the 'tablets' behind me and continued to relax in the pool, when my sister's daughter and son began to complain that their eyes hurt. i told her and her brother to step out of the tub to see if they'd feel any better. it was only the that i realized that it was a bit difficult to breathe... i turned around to the small white tablets, fear surrounding me, as i realized what they were. the tablets were pool chlorinating tablets who were never designed to be in the main water. i grabbed one of the tablets and began vigorously shaking it in the water. nothing happened. fuck. i tossed the tablets towards the wall, and told everyone to \\"get out now!\\" after getting everyone out of the spa, back into our hotel room,and forcing my sister's kids to shower, i looked in my bag for my inhaler... it wasn't there. in my paniced state, i attempted to reassure myself that i was ok while trying to get as much air in my lungs as possible. normally if something simillar to this would have happened, i would have gotten someone to drive and buy me a new inhaler, but as i was out of country, so i couldn't really do anything. i sent my sister out to attempt to find an inhaler, and eventually (after about an hour) she came back with one. soothing my lungs and keeping me alive. after about a day of being bed-ridden, i was fine. sadly, it was also the end of our trip. later, i also realized that the chlorine had also discolored all of our swimsuits. ex: my black swimsut had turned brown.

Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"In June 1963, President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11114 as a supplement to his previous 1961 executive order, both aimed at promoting affirmative action policies to eliminate discrimination in employment. As per Executive Order 11114, all federal funds, including grants, loans, and any financial assistance given to state and local governments, needed to comply with the government's affirmative action policies in their employment practices. In this context, unions and employers who accepted taxpayer funds were also required to adhere to and comply with the affirmative action policies set forth by the government. This meant that unions and employers had to take active measures to ensure equal employment opportunities, diversity, and inclusion in their workforce, without any discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, or gender. This compliance with affirmative action policies emphasized the need for organizations to implement initiatives, measures, and practices to actively recruit, train, and promote underrepresented groups in their workforce. It also necessitated regular monitoring and reporting of their progress towards achieving the government's affirmative action goals. In summary, the kind of funds that unions and employers had to have compliance with the affirmative action policies primarily included federal funding sources, such as grants, loans, and financial assistance provided to state and local governments, which ultimately trickled down to recipient organizations. These organizations were then bound to adhere to and support the government's affirmative action policies in their employment practices to ensure a diverse and inclusive workforce without discrimination."},{"prompt":"Question: When was Apple Computer founded I found the following answer on Google: , Apple maintains 394 retail stores in fourteen countries as well as the online Apple Store and iTunes Store .

In a rare interview with the BBC, Moreno reflected on his miraculous experience and speculated on the possibility of a higher power contributing to his survival. The accident occurred when Moreno and his brother, Edgar, were standing on the window washing platform at the top of Solow Tower. The cables holding the platform \\"slipped from their attachment point,\\" causing the left side of the platform to drop first. Unfortunately, Edgar perished in the accident, but Moreno was found crouching on the ground, still holding the platform controls when the paramedics arrived. The impact left Moreno with severe injuries to his brain, spine, chest, and abdomen, in addition to broken ribs, legs, and an arm. He spent three weeks in a coma following the event, but eventually recovered against all odds. One of his treating doctors, quoted in a New York Times article at the time, stated, \\"If you are a believer in miracles, this would be one.\\" Many have speculated on the factors leading to Moreno's survival, with some suggesting that the window washing platform surfed the air, slowing his descent.

Moreno admits he has regained much of his health and has a newfound appreciation for family since the accident. Though he still faces some difficulties, such as trouble finishing sentences and being unable to run, he remains grateful for his ability to walk, saying, \\"Thank God I can walk.\\" This incredible story is a testament to the power of human resilience and raises questions about the nature of miracles.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. Upon this point I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. However, what I can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun! OK..so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character? Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series? The point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm! Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berryman. Best scene? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  Priceless!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: In January, as the date of Christopher Sepulvado’s execution approached, the Louisiana Department of Corrections did not have the drugs it needed to carry out his death sentence. So the state turned to a supplier that uses hydromorphone to relieve patients’ suffering, not to kill them: Lake Charles Memorial Hospital. “We assumed the drug was for one of their patients, so we sent it. We did not realize what the focus was,” said Ulysses Gene Thibodeaux, a board member for the private, nonprofit hospital and chief judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeal. “Had we known of the real use,” he said, “we never would have done it.” The Department of Corrections bought 20 vials of the drug on Jan. 28, a week before Sepulvado’s scheduled execution, according to a document provided by the state in a lawsuit challenging its lethal-injection practice. Until now, the source of those vials has not been publicly known. Thibodeaux said it’s routine for hospital pharmacies to supply drugs to other pharmacies, including those run by the state, for their patients. “We never inquire into the purpose for it. We assume it’s for legitimate and noble purposes,” Thibodeaux said. “We have assurances from our CEO, who is a very forthright guy, that this will not happen again.” State officials with the Louisiana Department of Corrections did not respond to repeated requests to comment for this story. Sepulvado’s lawyers declined to comment. Sepulvado wasn’t executed on Feb. 5. After a botched execution in Oklahoma, the state agreed to delay his execution for six months as it considered alternative methods. A status conference on his lawsuit has been set for November. Drugs expired as execution was delayed Sepulvado was convicted in 1993 for killing his six-year-old stepson by beating him with a screwdriver and submerging his body in scalding water. Over the years, his attorneys have delayed his execution by arguing that the state’s death penalty practices could violate his constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment. This is part of a continuing investigation into Louisiana’s execution methods. Highlights of our coverage: Louisiana’s death-penalty protocol uses same drugs as lengthy Arizona execution State failed to turn over key public records about execution drugs State has explored illegally obtaining drug for upcoming execution With lethal-injection drugs hard to get, states turning to custom pharmacies State’s supply of drug for executing prisoners has expired, says attorney for death-row inmate After several delays, his execution was rescheduled for early February. Three weeks before the state was supposed to carry out his death sentence, it didn’t have the drug it needed. Its supply of pentobarbital had expired in September. Throughout the fall, the state had scrambled to procure lethal injection drugs. Other states were having trouble finding them, too, after drug manufacturers refused to sell to prisons and current supplies started to expire. At one point, the Louisiana Department of Corrections considered ordering pentobarbital from an Oklahoma compounding pharmacy — which would have been illegal because the pharmacy wasn’t licensed in Louisiana. Then, nine days before Sepulvado’s Feb. 5 execution date, the state announced it had approved another method to put him to death. The new combination was hydromorphone and midazolam, the same drugs that had just been used in the prolonged execution of Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire. Drug obtained days before scheduled execution There was one problem with the alternate method: The state Department of Corrections apparently didn’t have hydromorphone, either. However, it did have midazolam, a sedative commonly in stock at pharmacies. A few days later — five days before the execution — Department of Corrections spokeswoman Pam Laborde said the agency had the two drugs it needed to kill Sepulvado. The department wouldn’t say where they came from. A federal judge ordered it to reveal the supplier to Sepulvado’s lawyers, but the department requested the information remain under seal. Now, two people — Thibodeaux and a source that refused to be identified — say the state got its hydromorphone from Lake Charles Memorial Hospital. The Lens also reviewed a document that confirmed the source of the drug. According to documents shared with Sepulvado’s lawyers, the drugs were sent to Elayn Hunt Correctional Center’s Medical Unit, which the state describes the site as a “medical facility for seriously or chronically ill offenders.” Properly permitted hospital pharmacies like the one at Lake Charles Memorial can legally supply medications to other pharmacies, as long as the drugs are for a hospital patient, according to Malcolm Broussard, executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy. The supplying pharmacy wouldn’t need a prescription for that particular patient. Those rules apply even to highly regulated drugs such as hydromorphone, he said. Broussard said he didn’t know enough about this particular transaction to comment on it. Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said he wasn’t aware of a hospital supplying a lethal-injection drug. But it isn’t surprising, he said, because hydromorphone is “more commonly used and would be available … unlike some lethal injection drugs.” Nationwide, drug suppliers concealed as drugs become hard to find Around the country, states have moved to conceal the sources of their execution drugs. Deborah Denno, a professor at the Fordham University School of Law and an expert on the death penalty, said states are becoming more secretive because the death penalty is becoming more controversial. “The stakes are higher because the drug supplier is … more vulnerable,” Denno said, pointing to several lengthy executions this year in Ohio, Oklahoma and Arizona. “They’re being secretive because they know they couldn’t carry out executions otherwise,” she said. “Look at the botches in 2014 alone.” Louisiana’s tactics have changed in the past year and a half. In 2013, the state identified the source of its execution drug, but refused to say when it expired. State officials told The Lens repeatedly that there were no records showing the expiration date of its pentobarbital. Documents later made public showed that wasn’t true; the state apparently violated open records law by withholding the information. Since then, the state has disclosed expiration dates but has argued that the source of the drugs is confidential. A state law says that the identities of people involved in executions cannot be publicized; the state Department of Corrections has argued that the law extends to drug manufacturers and suppliers. That’s why the state redacted the supplier of the hydromorphone in documents shared with Sepulvado’s lawyers. Oddly, however, the state didn’t redact the name of the pharmacist at Lake Charles Memorial who handled the order. Should the hospital have known what the drug was for? Denno said some states have resorted to unorthodox tactics as lethal injection drugs become harder to obtain. But she’s never heard of a state getting its drug from a hospital. “There’s so much secrecy involved in all of this that it’s really hard to tell where the drugs are coming from,” Denno said. She said Lake Charles Memorial Hospital should have known the state prison was looking for hydromorphone to carry out an execution. If suppliers like the hospital don’t want to be involved in executions, she said, they could require a contract when selling drugs that could be used in the death penalty. That contract would specifically prohibit the drug’s use in executions. That’s what drug manufacturers such as Hospira and Lundbeck have done, which sparked the shortage of lethal-injection drugs. “It’s a slippery slope for a hospital to be the supplier,” Denno said. “They are enabling execution, no matter which way you slice it.” ||||| • Corrections department did not reveal drug’s intended use • ‘Had we known we never would have done it’ • Arizona inmate was injected 15 times A Louisiana hospital unknowingly provided the state’s department of corrections with a drug used for lethal injections, it was revealed this week. The Louisiana department of corrections purchased 20 vials of hydromorphone from Lake Charles Memorial hospital a week before the scheduled execution of Christopher Sepulvado, but did not inform the hospital of its intended use for the drug, according to a report by non-profit news group the Lens. The same report noted that the purchase was revealed in a document provided by the state in a lawsuit challenging its lethal-injection practice. Sepulvado’s execution had been scheduled for 5 February, but was delayed and has not been rescheduled. Sepulvado was convicted of murdering his six-year-old stepson in 1993. Prosecutors said he beat the boy with a screwdriver before putting him in scalding water. “We assumed the drug was for one of their patients, so we sent it. We did not realise what the focus was,” Ulysses Gene Thibodeaux, a board member for the private, non-profit hospital, told the Lens. Thibodeaux is also chief judge of the third circuit court of appeal but did not preside over the case linked to the execution drugs. “Had we known of the real use we never would have done it.” Medical experts said the request would not seem that unusual to the hospital, because hydromorphone is used to minimise patient suffering and hospital pharmacies frequently provide drugs to other pharmacies, including those in the prison system. Louisiana was unable to obtain pentobarbital, a drug used in its usual cocktail for lethal injections. It then approved another method for executions using a combination of hydromorphone and midazolam. States have found it increasingly difficult to acquire lethal injection drugs since manufacturers, mostly based in Europe, began to withdraw supplies because of their opposition to capital punishment. The mixture of hydromorphone and midazolam was first used in January in Ohio’s execution of Dennis McGuire, which lasted nearly 30 minutes. Eyewitnesses said McGuire gasped for breath for at least 10 minutes while making attempts to sit up on the gurney. It was also used in April in Oklahoma’s botched execution of Clayton Lockett, which lasted about 43 minutes. The White House said that execution “fell short of humane standards”. Last month the mixture was used in Arizona, in the execution of Joseph Wood, who according to a court filing was seen to be “gasping and snorting” after he was injected. It subsequently emerged that Wood had been injected 15 times during the nearly two hours it took him to die. The attorney general, Eric Holder, subsequently said he was “greatly troubled” by the spate of botched executions. Information about how the Louisiana department of corrections obtained hydromorphone is sealed but, along with Thibodeaux’s claims, the Lens saw a document confirming the source of the drug. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A hospital in Louisiana accidentally gave the state's prison department a drug used for lethal injections.

If you've poured it into a microwaveable container, nuke it till it's malleable again. You should start with a clean base. Apply baby/talcum powder to the area. Make sure every last bit is dry! As you go, you may need to reheat your wax or apply more powder. Apply more powder if you experience more pain or start to sweat. The level of pain depends on you. For some women, it's not a problem. Don't let this deter you. This can be done with a butter knife. If it's too hot, wait a bit. If it's too cold, it won't tear off the hair 100% and will need to be reheated. Apply in the direction of the hair. Try to have about 1/4 - 1/2 an inch (.63 - 1.2 cm) before you go about waxing; the concoction needs something to adhere to; however, too long and it makes things difficult. Place a mirror between your legs to get a good look at your undersides. Start nearest your navel. Rub the strips into the wax a bit to ensure a clean removal. You can use waxing strips from the store or cut up an old cotton t-shirt. Sugar wax is water-soluble and your strips can be used more than once, if cleaned immediately and thoroughly. Cut your strips in 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) strips. The smaller ones can be used for clean-up or hard to reach places. Do one or two at a time to keep it manageable. The last thing you want is a bunch of cotton strips stuck down there. Leave the strip on the area for around 30 seconds, depending on its size. Rip it off (quickly!) in the opposite direction of hair growth. The quicker the better; you'll experience less pain if you go faster. Repeat this until all the hair is gone. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to apply an oil or lotion to calm the area. Use tweezers to grab any strays. Of course, clean up any mess you've made, too! Wax can get a bit difficult to deal with when hardened and the sugar may attract ants if left out for an extended period of time. What is a summary?","completion":"Making sugar wax is a simple and cost-effective method for hair removal. To create the wax, combine 2 cups of white sugar, 1/4 cup of lemon juice or vinegar, and 1/4 cup of water in a stainless steel pan. Boil the mixture and then reduce heat to medium, stirring occasionally. Once the mixture turns honey brown, remove it from heat. Test the wax for proper consistency and allow it to cool until it is hot but not burning. Before waxing, apply baby powder to the skin and use a butter knife to apply the wax in the direction of hair growth. Use waxing strips or cut pieces of cotton fabric to press into the wax and quickly remove in the opposite direction of hair growth. Reheat wax as needed and clean the area afterward, using oil or lotion for sensitive skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The car passed the motorcycle on the highway because the","completion":"car was traveling at a higher speed than the motorcycle. It was a clear, sunny day with only a few scattered clouds, creating the perfect atmosphere for a leisurely drive. Traffic was relatively light, allowing motorists to move freely and maintain their pace. The driver in the car felt a surge of energy as he pressed on the accelerator, and a sense of freedom filled his chest as his vehicle effortlessly glided forward. As the car continued to gain speed, it approached the motorcycle traveling steadily ahead in the lane. The motorcycle rider, dressed in a black leather jacket and matching helmet, seemed to be enjoying the warm breeze blowing against his body. He was focused on maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles while also soaking in the beauty of his surroundings. The open landscape stretched out before him, showcasing lush green fields specked with newly blooming wildflowers. The sun illuminated the vivid painted stripes across the horizon, casting a radiant glow upon the open road. As the car drew nearer, the motorcycle rider glanced in his side-view mirror and took note of the approaching vehicle. Recognizing the car's increased speed, he decided to move over to the right lane, granting the car ample space to pass. The driver in the car appreciated the rider's gesture and nodded his head in acknowledgment. The car's engine purred as it accelerated even further, overtaking the motorcycle in a smooth and controlled maneuver. The driver observed the motorcycle rider as he passed, noting his well-maintained bike and sensible gear. The rider appeared experienced and confident, seated firmly on his polished motorcycle with both hands gripping the handlebars tightly. The chrome engine gleamed in the sun, reflecting the joyous spirit of the open road as the tires hummed their anthem of freedom and exploration. The driver in the car imparted a brief yet heartfelt nod of respect before returning his focus to the road ahead. The car continued to outpace the motorcycle, leaving it behind in the oscillating sea of asphalt. The driver relished the thrill of that brief encounter, as it reminded him of the shared camaraderie among travelers and an unspoken appreciation for the simple joys of a scenic drive. The car gradually returned to its earlier cruising speed, merging seamlessly with the other highway occupants. Meanwhile, the motorcycle rider continued his journey at his preferred pace, soaking in the delights of the open road. He understood that each traveler sought their own unique experience, and while some desired the exhilaration of high speeds, others reveled in the serenity of a slower course. In the end, the car passed the motorcycle on the highway because the driver had chosen to embrace a faster pace for his journey, while the motorcyclist continued to bask in the slower and more contemplative rhythm of the road. The encounter, though brief, served as a gentle reminder to both travelers that, despite their different preferences, they were united by the shared love for adventure and exploration."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence or phrase in English.

Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity. Would company B have or not have tax benefits of debt? Hint: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.","completion":"Based on the trade-off theory of capital structure, a company that is mostly financed by equity, like Company B, would typically have fewer tax benefits of debt compared to a company mostly financed by debt, like Company A. The reason for this is that the trade-off theory suggests there are benefits to financing with debt, such as tax savings, and costs to financing with debt, such as bankruptcy costs and financial distress costs. Since Company B is mostly financed by equity, it is not leveraging the tax benefits that come with using debt financing. The tax benefits of debt financing usually arise from the fact that interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, reducing the overall taxable income of the company and, consequently, its tax liabilities. However, it is important to consider that the tax benefits of debt must be weighed against the costs of financial distress and potential bankruptcy that increased debt levels may bring. In conclusion, Company B would likely have fewer tax benefits of debt due to its choice to finance with equity rather than debt. This decision may be based on balancing the advantages and disadvantages of both financing methods according to the company's specific circumstances and goals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Witte was dispatched to make peace, negotiating the Treaty of Portsmouth . In 1905, there were naval mutinies at Sevastopol , Vladivostok, and Kronstadt, peaking in June with the mutiny aboard the battleship Potemkin. The mutineers eventually surrendered the battleship to Romanian authorities on 8 July in exchange for asylum, then the Romanians returned her to Imperial Russian authorities on the following day. Some sources claim over 2,000 sailors died in the suppression. The mutinies were disorganised and quickly crushed.

When comparing the swelling that resulted from the impact to the eye, it is crucial to consider varied factors that could have contributed to the difference in swelling for Jennifer and Angela. The most apparent reason for the increased swelling under Jennifer's eye is the difference in the forcefulness of the hit. In this situation, Angela was hit softer than Jennifer, which would generally result in less damage and, in turn, less swelling. As the force exerted on Angela's eye had a lesser magnitude, the soft tissues surrounding her eye absorbed less energy. Consequently, Angela experienced less inflammation and bruising around her eye. The human body has a built-in defense mechanism, which activates upon injury. The immediate physiological response of the body is to initiate an inflammatory process. It is characterized by reddening, heat, pain, and swelling due to increased blood flow to the affected area, bringing with it essential nutrients, immune cells, and proteins to help repair the tissue damage. However, this inflammatory response varies between different individuals and circumstances. In Jennifer's case, because she was hit with a stronger force, her body would need to marshal a more robust inflammatory response to address the greater damage sustained. Apart from the difference in the force of the hit, other factors can also impact the degree of swelling in each person. For instance, each individual's healing capacity, their overall health, and any pre-existing medical conditions they might have can all influence the extent of their swelling. Different people experience inflammation and heal at different rates, so it is essential to take into account the complex interplay of factors involved in such situations. Moreover, reactions to pain management medications and seeking timely medical intervention can play a significant role in managing inflammation and pain, as well as in promoting healing for both individuals. In conclusion, the difference in swelling under Jennifer's eye compared to Angela's is predominantly attributed to the fact that Angela got hit softer than Jennifer. However, it is crucial to remember that other factors, such as individual healing capacities and overall health statuses, can also contribute to this disparity in swelling. Medical attention and appropriate pain management strategies can further help manage their injuries and promote a timely recovery for both Jennifer and Angela."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Over a hundred animals were discovered trapped in a 20ft-deep pit, in a heartbreaking state of distress. The pit, filled with helpless animals, was first discovered by charity workers who managed to rescue one puppy and three adult dogs on their initial visit. These devoted individuals courageously braved the unimaginable sight in an effort to save as many animals as they possibly could. However, upon their return the following day, they were met with a disturbing revelation. The pit had mysteriously been filled in with earth. The rescuers' worst fears were confirmed when they discovered the remains of six dogs. The shifting earth, hiding the horrifying secret, betrayed subtle whimpers, leading the workers to rescue several more animals, miraculously still alive. But the sequence of unsettling occurrences didn't end there. The workers, shocked and confused, found that the corpses they had discovered on the previous day had been vanishingly moved from the site when they returned a day later. They were yet to comprehend the gravity of what had transpired. The enigma surrounding the movement of the corpses triggered debate and prompted activists to launch investigations. Preliminary claims put the blame on loathed officials, colloquially known as Chengguan, who are speculated to have involvement in this heart-wrenching occurrence. The events recount a chilling sequence of undenied animal cruelty that inflict not just physical torment but a psychological despair, as animals are found in traumatic states.

Q:Process: - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose cool air falls from above happens, how will it affect more ice crystals will form. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation (cool air falling from above) can have an effect on the process of ice crystal formation in clouds. When cool air falls from above into a cloud, it could lead to a more rapid decrease in temperature within the cloud. This increased cooling rate can cause the water droplets in the clouds to freeze at a faster pace, hence promoting the formation of more ice crystals. As these ice crystals grow by absorbing the surrounding water droplets, they eventually develop into snowflakes, which then fall to the ground. An indirect effect of the cool air falling from above could be the potential to create more turbulent conditions within the cloud. Turbulence can lead to the movement and mixing of air, which further enhances water droplets' collision and coalescence, promoting the formation of more ice crystals. In conclusion, the introduction of cooler air falling from above can affect the process of ice crystal formation by accelerating the cooling rate and facilitating turbulence within the cloud. These factors contribute to the increased formation of ice crystals, which ultimately form snowflakes and fall to the ground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This article: Although John Foster Dulles, the United States Secretary of State recommended on 24 October for the United Nations Security Council to convene to discuss the situation in Hungary, little immediate action was taken to introduce a resolution, in part because other world events unfolded the day after the peaceful interlude started, when allied collusion started the Suez Crisis. The problem was not that Suez distracted U.S. attention from Hungary but that it made the condemnation of Soviet actions very difficult. As Vice President Richard Nixon later explained, \\"We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against [Gamel Abdel] Nasser\\".The United States response was reliant on the CIA to covertly effect change, with both covert agents and Radio Free Europe. However, their Hungarian operations collapsed rapidly and they could not locate any of the weapon caches hidden across Europe, nor be sure to whom they'd send arms. The agency's main source of information were the newspapers and a State Department employee in Budapest called Geza Katona. By 28 October, on the same night that the new Nagy government came to power, RFE was ramping up its broadcasts—encouraging armed struggle, advising on how to combat tanks and signing off with \\"Freedom or Death!\\"—on the orders of Frank Wisner. When Nagy did come to power, CIA director Allen Dulles advised the White House that Cardinal Mindszenty would be a better leader (due to Nagy's communist past); he had CIA radio broadcasts run propaganda against Nagy, calling him a traitor who'd invited Soviet troops in. Transmissions continued to broadcast armed response while the CIA mistakenly believed that the Hungarian army was switching sides and the rebels were gaining arms.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who reproduced a scene from Martin Schongauer's engraving Flight into Egypt? ? Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

However, after sitting through the latest box office attempt, the woefully misguided and catastrophically flawed film \\"Wasted Potential,\\" I can confidently say my expectations were not met. Instead, I was left feeling nothing short of disappointment, disbelief, and a nagging yearning for the lost hours I will never get back. \\"Wasted Potential\\" is a testament to the collapse of originality in modern cinema. From the moment the opening credits rolled, it was clear that the filmmakers had put minimal effort into the storyline and relied heavily on overused clichés and tropes to fill the void in creativity. Characters in the film felt shallow and one-dimensional, each one mirroring their cinematic predecessors without adding an iota of freshness or depth to their performances. The dialogue was forgettable, further weakening an already flimsy script. Packed with banal conversations and forced humor, the entire film reeked of unoriginality. The lack of chemistry between the actors left me cringing in my seat, and each scene transition brought nothing more than a sense of relief knowing I was one moment closer to the end of this abomination. Throughout the film, the lack of substance and plot development became painfully obvious, as the weak storyline limped from one predictable scene to another. The laziness in the script did nothing more than leave the audience questioning the film's purpose. The film's desperate attempts to entertain through cheap slapstick humor and low-grade action sequences only managed to insult the intelligence of the viewers and tarnish the reputation of the concerned genre. Visually, \\"Wasted Potential\\" fails to offer anything notable. In an era where innovative cinematography is celebrated, this film's aesthetic qualities were lackluster at best, and highly derivative at worst.

No. Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"using a bellows can do what to the oxygen near a fire? \\" is \\"evaporation\\", given that using bellows can increase the oxygen near a fire? A:","completion":"Though the provided answer options are 'Yes' and 'No', it isn't suitable to use either of them in addressing the question regarding a bellows' effect on oxygen near a fire. That being said, the assertion that the right answer to the question is \\"evaporation\\" isn't accurate either. Using a bellows near a fire can indeed increase the oxygen supply, but it does not cause \\"evaporation\\" in the traditional sense of the term. Instead, the process involved here is \\"combustion.\\" Let me provide a more detailed explanation of the relationship between a bellows, oxygen, and fire. The principle behind using a bellows near a fire is to supply more oxygen to the fuel, which results in a more efficient and hotter combustion process. Combustion is a chemical reaction that occurs when a fuel source, such as wood, reacts with oxygen in the air, producing heat, light, and some other byproducts, like carbon dioxide and water vapor. A bellows is a mechanical device that helps to control the airflow around a fire. Consisting of an expandable chamber, it typically features flexible materials, like leather, and has rigid handles. When compressed, the chamber forces air out of a small nozzle or opening, generating a concentrated and directed stream of air. The primary purpose of utilizing a bellows is to deliver additional oxygen to the burning fuel, ensuring that the combustion process takes place more effectively and making the fire hotter and more intense.

Whos style was described as \\"highly melodic\\", Porno for Pyros or Marco Restrepo? A:","completion":"To answer this complex question, we would need to analyze the musical styles of both Porno for Pyros and Marco Restrepo to determine which one was described as \\"highly melodic.\\" Porno for Pyros was an alternative rock band from the United States, active between 1992 and 1997. The band was formed by Perry Farrell and Stephen Perkins, both former members of the famous alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Their music style was heavily influenced by alternative, psychedelic, and experimental rock. Throughout their career, the band released two studio albums, \\"Porno for Pyros\\" (1993) and \\"Good God's Urge\\" (1996). Their music tended to have a dark, moody, and atmospheric quality, with a focus on unconventional song structures and experimental sonic textures. While their melodies were unique and memorable, it may not be trivial to describe their overall style as \\"highly melodic.\\" On the other hand, Marco Restrepo is an independent musician and songwriter from the United States who has been active since around 2007. His music is characterized by a blend of various genres such as rock, blues, pop, and folk. Marco Restrepo is known for his versatile songwriting, which often incorporates catchy hooks and an array of melodic elements, including not only vocal melodies but also those played on instruments like guitar and piano. Taking into account the different musical styles of Porno for Pyros and Marco Restrepo, it seems that Marco Restrepo's style could be more accurately described as \\"highly melodic\\" in comparison. While both artists have made significant contributions to the world of music, it's Marco Restrepo's stylistic approach, versatile songwriting, and focus on melodic elements that make his work stand out as particularly melodic."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: Entity 1: vacuole Entity 2: tannin Output:","completion":"Task Explanation: The task asks you to determine if the second entity (meronym) is a part of the first entity (holonym), and classify them as \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" based on that relationship. In this case, you are given two entities - Entity 1 (vacuole) and Entity 2 (tannin). Guidelines: 1. Research and understand the relationship between the two entities. 2. Determine if the second entity (meronym) is part of the first entity (holonym). 3. Classify as \\"yes\\" if the second entity is part of the first entity, and \\"no\\" if it is not. Steps to find the answer: 1. Look up the definitions of both entities: Entity 1 (vacuole): A vacuole is a small cavity or space within the cytoplasm of a cell, enclosed by a membrane and typically containing fluid, such as nutrients or waste materials. Entity 2 (tannin): Tannins are a group of naturally occurring polyphenols found in plants, which can bind with proteins and precipitate, making them less available for absorption. 2. Determine the relationship. Tannins can be stored within plant cells, and plant cells have vacuoles as part of their structure. Tannins may sometimes be stored in vacuoles. 3. Based on the research and relationship, you can classify the entities: Since tannins can be stored in vacuoles, you can classify them as \\"yes\\", meaning that the second entity (tannin) is part of the first entity (vacuole)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: HubSpot tries to move past ethics questions HubSpot’s founders on Wednesday sought to move past an ethics scandal that recently claimed two key executives, saying that many employees stepped up to help it deliver a raft of new product updates at its annual user conference. “We certainly miss them on certain days. But we have a deep bench,” chief executive Brian Halligan said. “I don’t feel like we missed a beat.” The remarks, at a news conference coinciding with HubSpot’s Inbound user conference, marked the first public appearance by Halligan and chief technology officer Dharmesh Shah since the late-July firing of chief marketing officer Mike Volpe. HubSpot said Volpe was fired for violating the company’s ethics policy in connection with attempts to procure an unpublished book about the company. Another executive, vice president of content Joe Chernov, resigned before HubSpot could determine whether he also should have been fired. Halligan was fined for failing to report the incident to the company’s board swiftly enough. HubSpot said it had turned the results of its internal investigation over to legal authorities. Last week, BetaBoston reported that the US attorney’s office in Boston had opened a criminal investigation of the manuscript incident. The book in question was written by Dan Lyons, a veteran journalist and writer on the HBO series “Silicon Valley,” who worked in HubSpot’s marketing department for less than two years. His book, “Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble,” is billed as a humorous memoir of Lyons’s attempt to cash in on the tech boom. Lyons, Volpe, and Chernov have declined to comment since the news broke. None of them immediately responded to a message seeking comment Wednesday. Executives said 14,000 people registered for HubSpot’s weeklong Inbound conference this year, up from about 10,000 in 2014. The conference serves as the biggest venue for HubSpot to project its enthusiastic, fun-loving identity, complete with celebrity speakers and blaring dance music. It’s also where the company rolls out new products that it hopes will drive bigger sales in the year ahead. HubSpot’s cofounders, Halligan and Shah, didn’t address the book-manuscript incident from the convention center stage. They did announce several product upgrades, including branching into online advertising with the ability to publish “sponsored content” items on LinkedIn. HubSpot also said it was testing the ability to buy online ads through Google’s AdWords service. HubSpot has rejected industry-standard online ads in the past, saying they are based on interrupting people rather than enticing them. But Shah said the LinkedIn postings and properly targeted online ads, which can show people things they actually want to buy, made the company rethink its opposition. “We got over ourselves,” Shah said. Summary:","completion":"HubSpot had an ethics problem recently when some people at the company did bad things. Two important people, Mike Volpe and Joe Chernov, left the company because of this. The boss of HubSpot, Brian Halligan, said the company is still doing well and has many good people working there. The company made new updates to their products which they showed at a big meeting with music and famous speakers. The update lets people put special ads on a website called LinkedIn, and also on Google's AdWords service."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was persuaded to be a British delegate to a conference in Buenos Aires? ? In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry... The answer is:","completion":"Boosey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. Sent 2: And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. Sent 3: But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. Sent 4: On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. Sent 5: There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Sent 6: Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Sent 7: Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. Sent 8: And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Sent 9: Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. Sent 10: The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Sent 11: Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. Sent 12: See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. Sent 13: One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. Sent 14: While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: What are the reasons behind the government targeting women activists?
