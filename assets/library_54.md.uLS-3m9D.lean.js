Please answer the following question: Threatening behavior causes a fight-or-flight response in animals, and true False Fight or flight are extreme responses to stress. Given these facts, what does threatening behavior cause in animals among the following options: - negative - stress - dog - knife - disease - Movement - influenza - h2o Answer:","completion":"Threatening behavior causes stress in animals. The fight-or-flight response is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival. This response is triggered by the release of hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, that prepare an animal's body to either confront the potential threat or flee from it. Stress is a natural reaction to various challenging situations encountered by animals during their lives. It is an essential part of an animal's existence, allowing it to respond quickly and appropriately to danger. When an animal experiences a stressful situation, such as a confrontation with a predator or another animal, its body goes through several physiological and behavioral changes designed to maximize the chances of survival. These changes may include increased heart rate, heightened awareness, and a rush of energy, among other things. Experiencing stress in response to threatening behavior helps the animal to make quick decisions and take appropriate actions that could be life-saving. While stress is a normal and necessary part of an animal's life, prolonged or excessive exposure to stress can have negative consequences on an animal's health and well-being. If an animal constantly experiences threatening behavior or other stressors, its body's resources can become depleted, which can lead to a weakened immune system, increased susceptibility to disease, and, in severe cases, death. Therefore, among the options provided, threatening behavior causes stress in animals. This stress triggers the fight-or-flight response, which is an essential part of an animal's reaction to dangerous situations and improves their chances of survival. However, it is important to note that prolonged or excessive exposure to stress can have negative impacts on an animal's health and well-being."},{"prompt":"Question: - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals What might be the last step of the process?

Background: Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn (3 April 1925 - 14 March 2014), originally known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn, but later as Tony Benn, was a British politician, writer, and diarist. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 47 years between the 1950 and 2001 general elections and a Cabinet minister in the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally a moderate, he was identified as being on the party's hard left from the early 1980s, and was widely seen as a key proponent of democratic socialism within the party. Benn inherited a peerage on his father's death (as 2nd Viscount Stansgate), which prevented his continuing as an MP. Context: Benn's father had been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill increased the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession. In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn automatically became a peer, preventing him from sitting in the House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, who was at the time also the heir presumptive to a peerage. Benn continued his campaign outside Parliament. Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had members in the same or similar situation to Benn's (i.e., who were going to receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6 pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22 pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made at the time of his election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963. Question: What is peerage?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Peerage is like a special club for important people in the United Kingdom. These people are given fancy titles and sometimes become members of a group called the House of Lords, which helps make the country's laws. When someone gets a peerage, it can be passed on to their children when they grow up. Tony Benn got one of these titles from his dad, but he didn't want it because it stopped him from being in another group called the House of Commons, where he liked to work. So, after some time, they changed the rules and let Tony give up his fancy title, and he went back to the House of Commons to continue his work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In more detail, Turkey has been undergoing a transformation for several years, attempting to modernize its political, social, and economic systems in the hope of aligning itself with the standards of the European Union (EU). This process of reform is crucial for Turkey because it aims to address various challenges within the country, including the need for a more robust democracy, improved human rights, and greater economic stability. The European Union, as a key partner and potential future member, has a significant role to play in supporting Turkey's reform process. Firstly, the EU has been providing financial assistance and technical expertise to Turkey, helping the country implement necessary changes in its laws and institutions. This support is essential, as it allows Turkey to meet the stringent criteria set by the EU for accession, which include adopting the acquis communautaire – the body of legislative instruments and frameworks that comprise the EU's legal order. Secondly, the EU has been actively engaging in political dialogue and cooperation with Turkey on a range of issues. This has included discussions about democratization, human rights, the judiciary, and public administration reform. By maintaining open channels of communication and cooperation, the European Union is not only helping Turkey achieve its reform goals but also fostering a sense of trust and a shared vision for the future. Moreover, the EU has been instrumental in promoting regional stability and prosperity in southeastern Europe. Turkey plays a vital role in this effort, given its geostrategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. By continuing to support Turkey's reform process, the European Union indirectly contributes to the stability and well-being of its broader neighborhood, thus serving the EU's strategic interests as well. In conclusion, it is imperative that the European Union continues to actively engage with Turkey and encourage its reform process. This support is in the mutual interest of both parties, with Turkey gaining access to the resources and opportunities offered by the EU, while the European Union benefits from a more stable, prosperous, and democratic partner on its southeastern border. As Turkey continues its ambitious program of transformation, it is essential that the European Union remains steadfast in its support, recognizing the vital role that Turkey's progress plays in promoting peace, stability, and economic development in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The illegal ivory trade has been a major problem in Africa for decades. Poachers and hunters have killed off hundreds of thousands of elephants to obtain this precious material. Now, affected areas are taking action. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced on Wednesday that key states where poaching takes place have promised to stop the ivory trade and protect Africa's elephants. In the 1980s, as many as 1 million elephants across Africa were killed for their ivory tusks. This continued until 1989, when the Convention on International Trade in Species (CITES) voted to ban all trade in ivory. With trade , demand for ivory fell. Elephant populations slowly began to increase. However, this progress was short-lived. According to the IUCN, 2011 saw the highest levels of poaching and illegal ivory trading in at least 16 years. Around 25,000 elephants were killed in Africa that year. Preliminary data from the IUCN shows even higher levels of illegal trade may have been reached in 2013. \\"With about 22,000 elephants illegally killed in 2012, we continue to face a critical situation,\\" said John E. Scanlon, CITES Secretary-General. \\"Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rate continues.\\" At the African Elephant Summit, key African states where elephants make their home agreed to develop a \\"zero-tolerance attitude\\" towards poaching. The deal calls for maximum sentences for poachers and hunters, and increased cooperation between affected states. Officials are determined to classifying wildlife trading as a serious crime -- and to making sure that the people who commit it are punished. All participants at the conference agreed to sign the deal. With these states coming together, there may yet be hope for elephants.

Combine the constants on the right side of the equation: 0 = -346*z + (2177 + 219 + 372) The sum of the constants is: 2177 + 219 + 372 = 2768 Now, the simplified equation is: 0 = -346*z + 2768 2.

When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families. Question: What's the hardest part of life for astronauts in space?

A spectacular celestial event took place on Saturday night, capturing the attention of stargazers, photographers, and casual observers alike. \\"The colors were spectacular,\\" writes a CNN iReporter in Iceland: Iceland was treated to an enchanting show as the night sky was illuminated with vibrant colors, enchanting all those who took a moment to gaze upward. The celestial extravaganza was captured and shared by an excited and star-struck CNN iReporter, who described the incredible sight as \\"spectacular.\\" The Unforgettable Night in the Mainland U.S.: While Iceland might have been in awe of the brilliant colors, on the other side of the world, the United States was experiencing its own unique encounter with the lunar event. The perigee occurred at 11:34 p.m. ET in the mainland, adding a touch of enchantment and wonder to the night's proceedings. A Bigger and Brighter Full Moon: As a result of the perigee, the Earth's satellite delighted sky gazers with its glorious appearance. The full moon appeared about 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual, mesmerizing onlookers. This intensified lunar display occurred due to the moon's proximity to the Earth – just about 221,802 miles away – causing it to appear significantly larger and brighter than a regular full moon. The Significance of the Perigee Moon: A perigee moon, also known as the \\"Supermoon,\\" is a somewhat rare event in celestial terms. The moon's elliptical orbit brings it closer to our planet at certain points in time, allowing us to witness its larger-than-life appearance when it aligns with a full moon phase. While many may regard this event as just a pretty sight, its occurrence reminds us of the intricate workings of our solar system and the endless fascination it holds. Conclusion: The recent perigee moon served as a beautiful reminder of the incredible wonders our natural world has to offer. From the awe-inspiring colors reported by the CNN iReporter in Iceland to the mesmerizing size and brightness experienced in the mainland United States, the night sky was a canvas of cosmic beauty that captivated the attention of countless observers.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: Cost-of-attendance stipends show which sports colleges want to spend on This story has been revised to reflect the following correction: All Big East schools are offering stipends to men’s and women’s basketball players, but some are offering them to athletes in other sports. An earlier version of this story was incorrect on this point. One of the most significant changes in the history of college sports is quietly taking place this spring, as athletics departments planning budgets contend with new rules that allow schools to pay athletes thousands of dollars in stipends to cover the incidental costs of college. The new “cost-of-attendance” stipends — money for gas, groceries, travel home and other similar expenses incurred by college students — are optional, and based on school financial aid office estimates. They vary widely between schools, but generally fall in the range of 2,000 to 5,000. In and around Washington, how colleges are handling the stipends provides a microcosm of how this change is playing out across Division I, the financially disparate top tier of college athletics that includes wealthy powerhouses such as Texas and smaller institutions such as Howard. Many big schools in the so-called “power five conferences” are giving the extra spending money to all scholarship athletes, while some schools in smaller conferences are providing the stipends only to basketball players, or are declining to offer them altogether. In this region, Virginia and Maryland — both members of financially flush power conferences — are giving stipends to all scholarship athletes. Georgetown, George Washington and George Mason will give the stipends only to men’s and women’s basketball players. And Howard and American, the smallest local schools in Division I, are not adding the stipends for any of their athletes, although American Athletics Director Billy Walker said his school was “exploring our options.” “Everybody is a little apprehensive to see how this will play out,” Walker said. “I’m concerned that it will cost some schools so much to keep up that they have to drop other sports.” That concern was part of the reason this change is happening this year, and not four years ago. In 2011, the NCAA briefly allowed schools to offer these stipends, but more than 100 Division I schools objected, some citing concerns similar to Walker’s, and the rule was overturned. That reversal, in part, motivated leadership of the bigger conferences to push for last year’s change in the NCAA’s structure that, essentially, lets the power five conferences make some of their own rules. One of the first changes instituted was this new stipend. Virginia will give 3,180 to in-state undergraduate scholarship athletes, and between 3,470 and 4,450 for out-of-state students, depending on where they live, according to Jim Daves, assistant athletics director. Maryland financial aid officers have not finalized their estimates yet, said Senior Associate Athletics Director Marcus Wilson, but using last year’s numbers, the school would have awarded stipends ranging from about 3,200 to 3,800. The extra stipends will cost Maryland and Virginia an extra 700,000 to 1 million or so yearly, but neither school’s officials said they expected to have to cut elsewhere to come up with the money. Schools outside the power five conferences, who can’t count on guaranteed millions in football-related television revenue, are approaching the stipends with more trepidation. Athletic directors at George Washington and George Mason said they’d like to give the money to all athletes, but started with just basketball. Both schools are in the Atlantic 10, and said they voted along with their peers earlier this year to mandate schools give stipends to men’s and women’s basketball players. “You’d like to do it across the board, but that’s a whole other conversation,” said Brad Edwards, athletics director at George Mason, where the 28 men’s and women’s basketball scholarship players will each get stipends of about 3,600, adding about 100,000 to the athletic department’s budget. George Washington hasn’t finalized its stipend amount for next year, but Athletics Director Pat Nero thinks it will be about 3,000 per player, costing the school about 80,000 to 85,000. “Men’s and women’s basketball are the sports we emphasize most in our conference. We wanted to make sure we didn’t fall behind,” Nero said. “We just weren’t sure of the landscape nationally. We wanted to make sure this did not become a competitive disadvantage.” In response to questions, Georgetown Athletics Director Lee Reed emailed a written statement explaining the school’s decision to give stipends to just basketball players. Reed declined to disclose exactly how much Georgetown’s stipends will be, but the school’s financial aid office estimates the amount at about 2,600. “As college athletics has gone through this reformation period over the last several years, Georgetown has said all along that we would remain competitive nationally as we have throughout our rich history,” Reed wrote. To critics of amateurism such as economist Andy Schwarz, the ease with which schools added stipends undercuts the argument made by some schools in 2011 that such stipends could lead schools to eliminate unprofitable sports. “The rhetoric that you hear a business say before a fixed price changes is just that: rhetoric. The actions that you’re seeing now are more telling,” said Schwarz, who uses clinical economic terms when discussing college sports that would make some school officials cringe. “This is a great natural experiment. We’re getting to see change in an economic environment and see how firms react,” Schwarz said of the new stipends. “We’re learning a ton about the real preferences of schools with where they decide to put their money.” Will Hobson is a national sports reporter for the Washington Post. He has previously worked for newspapers in Tampa, Clearwater, Daytona Beach, and Panama City, Fla. In 2014, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in local reporting for his work on Tampa Bay Times stories about abusive landlords and squalid government-funded housing for the homeless. Summary:","completion":"The new \\"cost-of-attendance\\" stipends in college sports are causing financial concerns for some institutions. These stipends, which cover incidental costs of college and fall in the range of 2,000 to 5,000, vary widely between schools and are optional. Wealthy powerhouses like Texas are giving extra spending money to all scholarship athletes, while some schools in smaller conferences are providing them only to basketball players or not at all. This has raised concerns over financial disparities and the potential for some schools to drop other sports in order to keep up with the cost. Critics argue that the ease with which some schools added stipends undercuts the argument that they could lead schools to eliminate unprofitable sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims, along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine, and here Susan Lucci performs as a siren, although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one. Isabelle (Lucci), inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself, coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart. In the wake of the hit-man's assault upon Collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious concerning Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators, each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements. Released upon a Fremantle DVD, this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality, and although no extra features are provided, the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.

Based on the given scenario, we are merely informed that a food vendor is standing on the sidewalk next to his food cart and observing a black woman passing by. This does not offer any relevant perspective or insights which could be used to ascertain the motives or the business objectives of the food vendor. We cannot infer whether the food vendor desires fewer customers or if he wants to lose money from this situation. Normally, vendors would want to attract more customers to increase sales and consequently earn more money. However, without any context hinting towards either the vendor's dissatisfaction with his business, the quality of his products, his preferred customer base, profit and loss situation, or his business specific goals, jumping to the conclusion presented in the hypothesis would be presumptive.

In Kathmandu, the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands, nearly bankrupting himself. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto.

Here is a goal: To get your cat to stay off of the kitchen counters. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of getting your cat to stay off the kitchen counters, I would suggest the following method: Step 1: Remove temptations and make the counters less appealing Justification: Cats often jump on counters because they smell food or are curious about the items on them. Keeping the counters clean and free of food will make them less tempting and interesting for the cat. Step 2: Provide alternatives Justification: Offering alternative high spots, like a cat tree, will give the cat a more approved place to do their instinctual climbing and exploring. Make sure the alternative area is inviting and comfortable, so the cat would prefer it over the countertops. Step 3: Use deterrents Justification: Applying double-sided sticky tape or aluminum foil on the counter when you're not around can make the surface unappealing for the cat, discouraging them from jumping up. Always make sure to remove the deterrents when you're in the kitchen, to prevent accidents. Step 4: Train and reward positive behavior Justification: Consistently training and rewarding your cat when it stays off the counter will reinforce the desired behavior. Use positive reinforcement methods, such as treats or playtime, to reward your cat for staying off the kitchen counter. Step 5: Discourage counter surfing Justification: If you catch your cat on the counter, gently discourage them by picking them up and placing them in the alternative area you've provided. Be consistent in your response, so the cat learns that being on the counter isn't allowed. By implementing this method, you will address the underlying reasons for the cat's desire to jump on the counters, while also providing alternative spaces for them to explore and discouraging the undesired behavior.

You witnessed it, your perceptual field changes, so now you need to share it. I created this site to help the UFO community get a little bit organized. I noticed that there was a lot of chaos when searching for UFO sighting reports, so I hope this site helps. I wanted to support those eyewitnesses who have tried to tell others about what they have seen, yet were laughed at by even closest of friends. More and more each day the governments of the world leak bits and pieces of UFO information to the public. They have a trickle down theory in hopes of slowly getting citizens use to the idea that we are not alone in universe and never have been. The truth is being leaked drop by drop until one day we look around and find ourselves neck high in it. The discovery of alien species in existence is the most monumental scientific event in human history, suppression of that information is a crime against humanity. About me: I live in Taiwan.

Photos taken April 2 and April 3 by a camera on the Curiosity rover were beamed millions of miles from Mars to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. According to NASA, a bright spot appears in single images taken by the stereo camera's \\"right eye\\" camera, but the spot doesn't show up in images taken less than a second later by the left-eye camera. In the two right-eye images, the spot is in different locations of the image frame, and, in both cases, at the ground surface level in front of a crater rim on the horizon, Justin Maki, a NASA imaging scientist said April 8 by email through a spokesman. \\"One possibility is that the light is the glint from a rock surface reflecting the sun,\\" Maki said in the statement. \\"When these images were taken each day, the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot, west-northwest from the rover, and relatively low in the sky.\\" Another possibility is that the bright spots are sunlight reaching the camera's image sensor through a vent hole in the camera housing, which has happened before with Curiosity and other Mars rovers, the agency said. Latest Houston News Video (Story continues below ...) \\"We think it's either a vent-hole light or a glinty rock,\\" Maki said in the emailed statement. Another possibility is that it's a cosmic ray striking the camera's detector, he added. Before NASA offered a suggestion of what might be the source of the bright spots, bloggers and space enthusiasts started chiming in. RELATED: The biggest hoaxes ever exposed Scott C. Waring, who maintains the website UFO Sightings Daily, posted the photo April 6. Waring noted that the light shines upward, as if from the ground, and is very flat across the bottom. \\"This could indicate there there is intelligent life below the ground and uses light as we do,\\" Waring wrote on his website. \\"This is not a glare from the sun, nor is it an artifact of the photo process.\\" On Tuesday, Slate.com's Bad Astronomy blog suggested that a UFO conspiracy site might not be the best source of information for exploring serious planetary phenomena. A more serious source of this light, said blogger Phil Plait, is that \\"a subatomic particle smacked into the camera, leaving behind its trail of energy.\\" HoustonChronicle.com: Vast ocean found on Saturn – could it sustain life? Earlier this month, NASA announced that on April 2, the Curiosity rover drove the last 98 feet needed to arrive at \\"the Kimberley,\\" a spot where it can study rock clues about ancient environments that might have been favorable for life, according to a news release. The Kimberley, where four different types of rock intersect, is named for a region of western Australia. The rover's stay there has been planned since early last year, the release said. \\"This is the spot on the map we've been headed for, on a little rise that gives us a great view for context imaging of the outcrops at the Kimberley,\\" Melissa Rice of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said in the release. Rice is the scientist in charge of planning several weeks of observations, sample-drilling and on-site laboratory analysis of the area's rocks. Arrival at this location means Curiosity has driven 3.8 miles since August 2012, when it landed inside Mars' Gale Crater. HoustonChronicle.com: Space station sidesteps space junk again The Kimberley investigations are to be the most extensive since Curiosity spent the first half of 2013 in an area called Yellowknife Bay, the release said. At Yellowknife Bay, the one-ton rover examined the first samples ever drilled from rocks on Mars. These samples showed signs of an ancient lakebed environment that provided the chemical ingredients and energy necessary for life, the release said. At the Kimberley and, later, at outcrops on the slope of Mount Sharp inside Gale Crater, researchers plan to use Curiosity's science instruments to learn more about habitable past conditions and environmental changes.

A bright speck that appears to flare upward can just be made out, right at the rim of a rise. A picture taken by the right navcam on the day before shows a similar bright speck, seen from a slightly different perspective. The only problem is that the navigation camera is a stereo system, and the left-hand navcam doesn't show the bright spots on either day. That suggests that the \\"light\\" might be a bit of lost data that left blank spots only on the right-hand navcam pictures. And it suggests that people are looking at the pictures from Curiosity very, very closely. If there's a message from Mars flashing in any photos, you can bet somebody's going to see it. We've asked NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to take a look at the pictures, and if we hear anything back, you'll find the update right here. Now, about that deer-cam UFO... Update for 9 p.m. ET April 7: Doug Ellison, an imaging guru who happens to work at JPL, quickly told me in a Twitter update that the bright spot is due to a \\"cosmic ray hit\\" affecting the rover. (Later: The Surrey Space Center's Chris Bridges agrees.) Update for 12:50 a.m. ET April 8: Here's a recap of the four pictures we're talking about: Update for 3 p.m. ET April 8: JPL sent along a couple of potential explanations for the bright spot, and they don't include the cosmic ray scenario. Get the details here. |||||Summary:","completion":"Scott Waring is a man who saw some UFOs and decided to create a website to help people share their UFO sightings. Recently, a camera on a rover, which is like a little robot car, on Mars took pictures that seemed to show a bright light coming from the planet's surface. People are wondering if this could be a sign of alien life, or if it might just be a reflection of sunlight or an issue with the camera. Scientists are studying the images to find out more about what this light could be."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: Their influence disappeared and they just went to live in the city. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? -yes. -it is not possible to tell. -no.","completion":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that \\"their influence waned, and they began to be absorbed into the general population,\\" which suggests that their power and impact diminished over time and they gradually became part of the larger, non-specific population group. This situation occurs when a previously prominent or influential group loses its distinctive identity, relevance, or authority, and its members assimilate into the broader society. This process can happen for various reasons, such as socio-political changes, cultural shifts, or technological advancements, among others. The hypothesis states that \\"their influence disappeared, and they just went to live in the city.\\" This statement presents a more concise and specific version of the premise, highlighting key aspects such as the complete disappearance of their influence and their eventual relocation to an urban setting. Given that both statements reference the decline of a group's influence and its subsequent integration into the larger population, it is clear that the premise entails the hypothesis. However, it is important to note that the hypothesis simplifies the premise by stating that their influence \\"disappeared\\" instead of \\"waned.\\" In the premise, it could imply a gradual decrease, while the hypothesis implies a more sudden or complete absence of influence. Furthermore, the hypothesis specifically mentions their relocation to \\"the city,\\" whereas the premise talks about being absorbed into the \\"general population\\" without specifying a location. Despite these differences in wording, the overall message aligns, stating that the group's influence diminished, and they integrated into the broader community. As a result, one can reasonably conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He bought a Tiger Moth in 1992 and realised he had flown it 10 times before. The airport access road in his hometown is being renamed after him. Article:","completion":"Title: The Inspiring Life and Legacy of Great Grandfather Gordon Jones: A Tale of Bravery, Aviation, and A Tiger Moth A heartwarming story filled with the excitement of adventure, authentic camaraderie, and the rediscovery of an old friend has emerged from the life of great-grandfather Gordon Jones. Having flown with the Canadian Air Force as far back as 1941, Jones later purchased a Tiger Moth aircraft in 1992, leading to the delightful realization that he had flown the very same plane 10 times before. Fast forward to today, and the airport access road in his hometown is being renamed in his honor, a fitting tribute to a man who has spent a lifetime soaring above the skies. Gordon Jones' love affair with aviation began as a young man when he first took to the skies with the Canadian Air Force during the Second World War. It was 1941, and the world was in turmoil. Thousands of brave young men and women took risks for their countries, and Jones was no exception. As part of the Air Force, he displayed dedication, skill, and passion for his craft, quickly distinguishing himself among his peers. After serving his country valiantly, Jones returned home with a lasting affection for the sense of freedom and exhilaration that came with soaring through the clouds. However, he could never have anticipated the extraordinary turn of events that awaited him over four decades later. In 1992, the retired airman made a fascinating discovery; he purchased a Tiger Moth aircraft and, on closely examining its logbook, realized with astonishment that he had flown the very same plane a decade before. This chance reunion between a man and his aircraft reaffirmed Jones' passions for aviation and brought back a flood of memories from his time in service. The Tiger Moth itself is a legendary aircraft with a storied history. Highly versatile, agile and easy to handle, the aircraft have been widely used in military and civilian training as well as for sport and leisure. The rediscovery of this historic aircraft further solidified the connection between Jones and the extraordinary aircraft. Jones' dedication to aviation and his community continued long after his years of service. His influence has been felt greatly within his hometown, and the decision to rename the airport access road after him came as a fitting tribute to his lifelong endeavors. The renaming ceremony will not only immortalize his contributions to the aviation world but also highlight the profound impact he has had on those who shared his passion for flying. Inspirational figures like great-grandfather Gordon Jones are rare gems who remind us of the importance of pursuing one's passions and leaving a legacy for future generations. Few people can claim a connection with aviation as deep and meaningful as Jones', and his remarkable story serves as an embodiment of dedication and the timelessness of pursuing one's dreams. From flying with the Canadian Air Force during the Second World War to the serendipitous encounter with his beloved Tiger Moth, Gordon Jones' life has been a testament to the power of determination, commitment, and love for one's craft. His radiant spirit of adventure and thirst for freedom will continue to inspire and guide countless aviation enthusiasts, as well as serve as a poignant reminder that some bonds transcend time and circumstance. As the newly renamed airport access road beckons travelers and aviation enthusiasts alike, future generations will remember the inspiring tale of a brave airman and his love for the open skies. Great-grandfather Gordon Jones' legacy will soar for years to come, encapsulating the spirit of adventure, determination, and the joy of following one's dreams, no matter where they may lead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes The prompt describes an older man with a long white beard, glasses and a black fedora who is sitting in front of a white door. Adjacent to him is a portrait painting depicting him smoking. The description provides specific details about the man's appearance, including his experience of age indicated by the white beard, the glasses he wears and the black fedora on his head. The complexity of this visual image is deepened by the introduction of a portrait painting that features this man engaged in the act of smoking. This introduces a second, artistic depiction of the same man, creating a sort of parallel or mirror image to the real person. This second depiction not only confirms his identity but also presents a different aspect of him - as a smoker. The essence of the description is a man placed next to a representation of himself, in this case, in the form of a painted portrait. Therefore, it indeed means that \\"a person is next to his own portrait\\". The person (an older man with the details specified) and his portrait (a painting depiction of him smoking) are located next to each other, establishing a scene where the man exists alongside a piece of art that is a representation of himself.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What was the last name of the person who was bitten by a monkey? Answer the above question based on the context below: By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Ensign Seymour.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Since 1974, Cyprus has been divided, de facto, into the government-controlled southern two-thirds of the island and the Turkish-Cypriot northern one-third. Options: [1]. Yes [2]. It's impossible to say [3]. No Hypothesis: turkey is an invader on this island","completion":"Based on the information presented in the paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is true in the context that Turkey has played a significant role in the division of Cyprus, leading to the creation of the Turkish-Cypriot northern one-third of the island. First, it is essential to understand the historical context surrounding the situation. In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus in reaction to a coup d'etat orchestrated by the military regime in Greece, which sought to unite Cyprus with Greece. The invasion resulted in the division of the island. Up until today, a buffer zone known as the \\"Green Line\\" separates the two parts of Cyprus - the government-controlled southern region represents the Republic of Cyprus, while the northern region is predominantly Turkish-Cypriots, with the so-called \\"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\\" (TRNC). It is important to note that only Turkey officially recognizes TRNC, while the international community considers it to be occupied territory. Therefore, considering that Turkey's military intervention in 1974 caused the separation and division of the island, and Turkish troops remain in the northern part of Cyprus, the hypothesis \\"Turkey is an invader on this island\\" holds true. The Turkish occupation has had lasting impacts on the island and its population, contributing to the unresolved political status of the region. Numerous attempts to find a resolution have been made, including negotiations of reunification under a federal framework. However, agreements have yet to be reached, and the island remains divided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A Qualified Person Responsible for Pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, is an individual named by a pharmaceutical company as the main person responsible for ensuring that the company (the product's Marketing Authorisation Holder or MAH) meets its legal obligations for the monitoring of the safety of a medicinal product on the market. Can we draw the following conclusion? The QPPV ensures a company is safe. Options are: - Yes - It's impossible to say - No","completion":"The statement \\"The QPPV ensures a company is safe\\" is not entirely accurate, as it simplifies the role and responsibilities of a QPPV. It would be more appropriate to say that a QPPV is responsible for ensuring that a company meets its legal obligations in monitoring and maintaining the safety of the medicinal products it markets. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of this role, it's essential to delve into the responsibilities, the scope, and the importance of a QPPV in the pharmaceutical industry. The primary responsibility of a QPPV is to oversee the pharmacovigilance system of a pharmaceutical company, which in turn is dedicated to monitoring, evaluating, and minimizing risks associated with medicinal products. One of the key objectives of pharmacovigilance is to ensure that the benefits of the products outweigh the risks. The QPPV plays a vital part in the establishment and maintenance of this system by implementing procedures, training, and quality control measures. In addition to these responsibilities, a QPPV is also accountable for the following: 1. Overseeing expedited reporting, periodic safety updates, risk management plans, and signal detection activities for the company's products, ensuring that these meet regulatory requirements. 2. Ensuring that the company has in place a well-organized and effective pharmacovigilance system, with robust procedures and systems to collect, manage, and analyze safety information. 3. Managing the review and evaluation of safety data from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and other sources to assess potential safety signals and identify any need for further evaluation or action. 4. Collaborating with various stakeholders, including regulatory authorities, healthcare professionals, and patients, to facilitate continuous and transparent communication on safety-related matters. 5. Keeping the company and relevant parties informed of changes in regulatory requirements, industry standards, and best practices in pharmacovigilance. While the QPPV is responsible for ensuring the safe use of medicinal products, they cannot guarantee the overall safety of the entire company, as their responsibility is specifically geared towards pharmacovigilance. A pharmaceutical company's overall safety involves various other aspects, such as manufacturing practices, employee safety, environmental considerations, and more. Based on this understanding, from the options provided, the most accurate choice would be \\"No,\\" as the statement simplifies the QPPV's role and does not accurately capture the responsibilities of a QPPV within a pharmaceutical company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Most universities are publically funded so should have to be open with their materials. Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"The claim that publicly funded universities should be open with their materials is rooted in a few core principles: transparency, accessibility, and the efficient use of public resources. As a major component of public investment in higher education, these institutions must ensure that they bring value to society and give citizens an opportunity to access knowledge, participate in research, and develop skills. Here is some evidence to support the claim: 1. Public accountability: Universities that receive public funding have a responsibility to the taxpayers who support them. They must provide transparent information on how their resources are being used and the outcomes being achieved. By making educational materials openly available, universities can demonstrate their commitment to accountability and ensure the efficient use of public funds. For example, a study from the Center for American Progress found that transparency in higher education could drive improvements in efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability for colleges and universities (Hess, 2009). 2. Equity and Access: Publicly funded institutions have a responsibility to make education accessible to all members of society. Many students who depend on financial aid or loans face significant barriers in affording textbooks and other learning materials. By making their educational content open, universities can help break down these barriers and promote greater access to higher education across diverse socio-economic groups. A report from the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) found that open educational resources (OER) could lead to cost savings for students and facilitate more equitable access to learning materials (Perry, 2021). 3. Collaboration and innovation: Open educational resources enable faculty to collaborate on teaching materials, creating a shared pool of expertise that can improve the quality of instruction and enhance research. Open access policies also facilitate the flow of knowledge, allowing researchers and other professionals to build upon previous findings and develop new ideas. A study published in Science found that open access research articles were more frequently cited and shared than those behind paywalls, suggesting a positive correlation between openness and scientific impact (Piwowar et al., 2018). 4. Economic benefits: Various studies have shown that free access to scientific and academic resources can generate economic benefits by promoting innovation and fostering economic growth. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, an investment in knowledge infrastructure, such as open-access scientific journals, can contribute significantly to economic growth and social welfare (WIPO, 2021). Additionally, a study from the Copenhagen Business School estimated that an open-science policy in the European Union could generate a return on investment between 1.3 - 2.0 times the initial costs in the long term (Munuera et al., 2018). 5. Global outreach: By promoting openness in their materials, publicly funded universities contribute to the global pursuit of knowledge. They create opportunities for students and researchers in low and middle-income countries to access high-quality learning resources and engage with cutting-edge research. A study conducted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) found that open educational resources can promote greater equity since they provide free access to educational materials in various languages, tailored to various learning needs (Cobo et al., 2017). In conclusion, there is substantial evidence supporting the claim that publicly funded universities should be open with their materials. By sharing educational content and research findings freely, public universities can enhance accountability, promote equity, facilitate innovation, generate economic benefits, and contribute to the global sharing of knowledge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Sadly it's becoming a regular occurrence for crews to be assaulted. My last time was a few days ago and the worst thing about it was watching my crew mate and several police officers curl up laughing. I'll set the scene. Imagine. If you will. A large rather expensive hotel. Then add to that image a rather drunk and buxom young lady who is lying on the floor in a drunken slumber after taking off a lot of her clothes. She was just in her underwear. We were called to look after her. On our arrival she was absolutely fine. Stood up, walked to the stretcher and lay down. Whining about how we were the ' oppressors of society', and other such drivel Because I had the cheek to try and give her a tiny bit of dignity by covering her up with a blanket. She didn't want that. We made it to the ambulance without any hassle and started to do the necessary checks we do on every patient. Blood pressure etc etc when out of the blue she decided that she wanted to release her rather large breasts. Try as I might to give her a little bit of dignity she wasn't interested so we just made sure no one could see inside the ambulance. After a few minutes she calmed down so I put the blanket over her. Something I do for almost every patient. Without warning THWACK. she hit my in the face with her boob. Then. As I reeled from this waiting for my brain to catch up and make sense of everything, THWACK she did it again. Right round the face with a large breast!! I turned around to get some support from my colleagues who were crying. Both my crew mate and the officer. Crying. Neither able to speak………..

However, she later released her breasts while inside the ambulance, so at that point, she was partially clothed but not fully covered, and a blanket was used to cover her for dignity. Therefore, the correct answer is that she was wearing \\"her clothes\\" in a very minimal sense.

What is biological evolution by natural selection? What are some examples? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choices: (I) no. (II) yes.","completion":"The theory of evolution by natural selection, also known as biological evolution by natural selection, is a scientific concept developed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. The two questions you asked have the same meaning, so the answer is (II) yes. To answer the question about the theory and provide some examples, let me break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Understanding the theory Evolution by natural selection is a process that explains how species change over time through gradual genetic changes. It suggests that those individuals with traits best suited to their environment have a higher chance of surviving, reproducing, and passing on those favorable traits to their offspring. Step 2: Key principles of natural selection There are four main principles of natural selection: 1. Variation: Individuals within a population exhibit variations in their traits, such as size, color, shape, or behavior. 2. Inheritance: Some of these variations are inheritable, meaning they can be passed down from parent to offspring through genes. 3. Overproduction: Most species tend to produce more offspring than can survive, leading to competition for limited resources. 4. Differential survival and reproduction: Individuals with traits best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their favorable traits to their offspring. Step 3: Providing examples Here are some examples of evolution by natural selection: 1. Peppered moths: Before the industrial revolution in England, the majority of peppered moths were light-colored, which allowed them to camouflage against lichen-covered trees. With the rise of pollution, the tree bark became darker, making the dark-colored moths better camouflaged and more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, the dark-colored moths became more prevalent. 2. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria: When a bacterial population is exposed to antibiotics, the bacteria with genetic traits that make them resistant to the antibiotic are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass their resistance genes on to their offspring. Over time, this leads to an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 3. Darwin's finches: On the Galápagos Islands, Darwin observed various species of finches, each with a differently shaped beak adapted to their specific food source. Finches with beaks better suited to their food source were more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous beak traits to their offspring. In conclusion, the theory of evolution by natural selection is a fundamental concept in biology that describes how species change and adapt over time due to environmental pressures and the inheritance of favorable traits."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who recorded Bryter Layter? , can you please find it? Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales.

She told no secrets; but a hint was sufficient; for Mrs Amy guarded her daughter as a pearl of great price, and at once devised a very simple means of escape from danger. Mr Laurie was going to Washington on Dan's behalf, and was delighted to take his family with him when the idea was carelessly suggested. So the conspiracy succeeded finely; and Mrs Jo went home, feeling more like a traitor than ever. She expected an explosion; but Dan took the news so quietly, it was plain that he cherished no hope; and Mrs Amy was sure her romantic sister had been mistaken. If she had seen Dan's face when Bess went to say good-bye, her maternal eye would have discovered far more than the unconscious girl did. Mrs Jo trembled lest he should betray himself; but he had learned self-control in a stern school, and would have got through the hard moment bravely, only, when he took both hands, saying heartily: 'Good-bye, Princess. If we don't meet again, remember your old friend Dan sometimes,' she, touched by his late danger and the wistful look he wore, answered with unusual warmth: 'How can I help it, when you make us all so proud of you?

A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a 500 bond is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety. Along the way, they encountered a dying Chinese woman, and Ruth agreed to care for her child as well. Moved by her personal story and her beautiful singing voice, Tom is soon smitten with the young woman.

Write the answer: What is the SI unit of temperature?","completion":"The SI (International System of Units) unit of temperature is the kelvin, denoted by the symbol 'K.' Kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences. It was named after the British physicist and mathematician, William Thomson (also known as Lord Kelvin), who made significant contributions to the understanding of thermodynamics and the development of the concept of absolute zero temperature. Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, meaning it starts at absolute zero, the point at which all molecular motion theoretically ceases. This feature makes it distinct from the other two common temperature scales, Celsius and Fahrenheit, which use arbitrary reference points taken from the freezing and boiling points of water, making them relative temperature scales. In the Kelvin scale, one unit of measure, or one kelvin, is equivalent to the same incremental change as one degree Celsius (1 K = 1 °C). However, the Kelvin scale sets its zero point at absolute zero, which is -273.15 degrees Celsius (-459.67 degrees Fahrenheit). To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, one must simply add 273.15 to the Celsius temperature, so that: Temperature in kelvin (K) = Temperature in Celsius (°C) + 273.15 The Kelvin scale is widely used in scientific research and engineering areas, such as the study of thermodynamics, cryogenics, material science, and astronomy. The use of the Kelvin scale facilitates temperature calculations, promotes greater measurement consistency, and enables comparisons across various scientific fields and international borders. Furthermore, the Kelvin scale's foundation on absolute zero is essential for accurately describing the properties of materials subjected to extremely low temperatures. In summary, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin, symbolized by 'K.' This absolute temperature scale is an essential concept in a wide range of scientific disciplines and provides a useful, consistent method for quantifying and comparing temperature changes within different contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After everyone has left and they are no closer to an answer, Annie realizes that one person did not come to the dinner, so Jackie pays a late-night visit to the only absentee: the reclusive Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh). He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock. That same night, Jackie has a dream that the deceased Ned wants to share the winnings with his friends, as he has no family to claim the ticket.

The cute creature has been wrongly identified for 100 years, despite having been spotted in the wild, tucked into museum collections and even exhibited in zoos. But now scientists at the Smithsonian Institute have confirmed the loveable carnivorous mammal is a new species and have said it is 'an incredibly rare discovery in the 21st Century'. Eventually, the team discovered olinguitos living in an","completion":"area called the Tandayapa Valley, situated within the Andean cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. This hidden habitat provided the perfect conditions for the elusive animal, offering dense vegetation, a variety of food sources, and limited human interference. The olinguito primarily feeds on fruits, insects, and small vertebrates, which are abundant in the cloud forests. To identify the olinguito as a distinct species, researchers collected over 1,000 samples of DNA, photographs, and anatomical measurements, and compared them with other specimens housed in museums and zoos worldwide. This extensive analysis allowed the scientists to differentiate the olinguito from its close relative, the olingo, and conclusively confirm its status as a separate species. The discovery of the olinguito is significant not just because it represents a new species, but also because it highlights the importance of preserving the world's rapidly shrinking habitats and ecosystems. As the first new carnivore to be discovered in the Western Hemisphere in 35 years, the olinguito serves as a reminder that there are still countless species waiting to be discovered, but only if these fragile habitats continue to be protected and studied by conservationists and researchers. This unprecedented finding underscores the need for ongoing exploration and investment in scientific research to better understand our planet's diverse and unique wildlife, which could help towards preserving these precious ecosystems and ensuring the survival of species like the olinguito."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Identify important elements and expand the narrative To continue the text, I identified the significant elements from the given context, which are the people, the tree, the bush, and the heat. I expanded the narrative by describing the increasing temperature and how it affected people's preference for shade. Step 3: Maintain consistent tone and style To ensure the continued writing matches the original text, I maintained the same descriptive tone and style throughout. This allows for a seamless transition between the original text and my continuation. Step 4: Enhance the narrative with additional details I included additional details, such as the sun's position, to emphasize the reason why more people chose to sit near the tree over the bush. In this case, the tree's larger canopy provided a better shelter from the intense heat. Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, I extended the narrative logically by elaborating on the reasons why more people were sitting near the tree instead of the bush, considering the environmental conditions and people's need for shade. This approach helped me create a compatible continuation of the given text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: What percent of bannermen did the Han represent? Is \\"So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75% and Mongol Bannermen making up the rest.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, it appears that the statement provided is accurate. The Han bannermen indeed constituted a significant portion of the bannermen during the Qing Dynasty in China. However, before delving into the percentages, let's briefly discuss the background of bannermen and the ethnic groups involved during the Qing era. The Eight Banners system was a critical military and administrative organization devised by the Manchus, who established the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The three principal ethnic groups in the Eight Banners were Manchus, Han, and Mongols, and they were categorized into separate banners. When the Qing Dynasty took control of China in 1644, they faced resistance from the remnants of the Ming Dynasty and other opposition forces. To consolidate their rule, the Qing rulers not only sought the loyalty of the Han Chinese, who were the majority population, but they also actively incorporated Han people into their military and administration by enlisting them as Han bannermen. As stated in the quote, \\"So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75% and Mongol Bannermen making up the rest.\\" This data indicates that by 1648, the Han bannermen indeed represented a significant majority, at 75% of the total bannermen population. Meanwhile, the original ruling ethnic group, the Manchus, constituted only 16%, and Mongol bannermen made up the remaining percentage. It's essential to note that this percentage might have varied over time, but the statement provided reflects the situation in 1648 specifically. The overwhelming presence of Han bannermen showcases the recruitment strategy of the Qing rulers to maintain control in a predominantly Han-populated China, by enlisting them into their military and administration systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: south african football coach missing top players Text:","completion":"Title: South African Football Coach Struggles with Absence of Top Players In recent news, the South African football team has been facing significant challenges as their coach grapples with the absence of some of his top players. The national team, affectionately known as Bafana Bafana, has been put through an unavoidable hardship as the coach looks to form a winning team without his star players. The missing players' absence has left a gaping hole in the team, which the coaching staff is struggling to address. Several factors have contributed to this tricky situation. Firstly, some of the most talented players are out of the country, plying their trade for various clubs across Europe. This has widened the gap between local and international-based players, forcing the coach to dig deep into the talent pool to find suitable replacements. Injuries have also played their part in exacerbating the situation. Key players who have previously contributed to the team's success have fallen ill or sustained injuries, leading to their unfortunate withdrawal from the squad. This has left the coach with a daunting task of not only finding replacements but also nurturing their skills to match those of the first-team regulars. Moreover, scheduling conflicts have caused some players to be unavailable for national team duties. Domestic leagues and club commitments can, at times, interfere with a player's ability to participate in international matches. This conflict of interests leads to a difficult decision for players – choosing between their clubs and the national team. In some cases, club managers may be unwilling to let their players travel for international games due to the risk of injuries or fatigue. As the South African football coach faces this predicament, he has no choice but to adapt his tactics and work with the available talent. This calls for a significant shift in the team's playing strategy and formation. The coach needs to carefully assess the strengths and weaknesses of the remaining players and make the necessary adjustments in order to maximize their potential on the field. One possible solution may come in the form of youth development. The South African football system has been praised for its impressive youth development infrastructure. The coach could look to the younger generation of players to build a new, dynamic team that will eventually replace the current missing stars. This would require patience and careful nurturing of local talent, as well as investing in scouting to find potential future stars. Additionally, the coach must foster a strong sense of camaraderie and unity within the team to help compensate for the loss of its top players. Instilling a strong work ethic and commitment within the remaining players can help create a unified force on the pitch. This can be achieved by encouraging collaboration, trust, and open communication among the team members. In conclusion, the South African football coach faces an uphill battle to form a competitive team without his top players. It is crucial for the coach to adapt to these challenging circumstances by tapping into the available talent, nurturing young players, and fostering a strong team spirit. Doing so will not only help the team navigate through these difficult times but also build a solid foundation for future success. Only time will tell if these strategies can be effectively implemented, leading to a resurgence of Bafana Bafana on the global football stage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They released their debut album, Swan Songs, on September 2, 2008, and their live CD/DVD Desperate Measures, on November 10, 2009. Their second studio album, American Tragedy, was released April 5, 2011. All of the band members use pseudonyms and wear their own unique mask, most of which are based on the common hockey goaltender design. Context: The band originated on June 3, 2005, as The Kids from a song titled \\"Hollywood\\" (Later released as \\"The Kids\\") that Jorel Decker (J-Dog), Aron Erlichman (Deuce), and Jeff Phillips (Shady Jeff) posted on the band's MySpace profile to positive reviews, leading them to form the group Hollywood Undead with their friends George \\"Johnny 3 Tears\\" Ragan, Jordon \\"Charlie Scene\\" Terrell, Dylan \\"Funny Man\\" Alvarez, and Matthew \\"Da Kurlzz\\" Busek. In an interview with Shave magazine, J-Dog explained that when forming the band \\"Whoever was in the room at the time and played an instrument was in the band.\\" Phillips later left the group because of conflict with Erlichman. The band only took one year working on their debut album, Swan Songs. The other two years were spent looking for a company that wouldn't try to censor the album. They first signed a record contract with MySpace Records in 2005 but they left the label after the label tried to censor their first album. They then signed a contract with A&M/Octone Records and their first album, Swan Songs was released on September 2, 2008, and reached No.22 on the Billboard 200 in its first week of release, selling 21,000 copies; which was later on released in the United Kingdom on May 18, 2009, with two bonus tracks. In April 2009, the band toured with American electronic musician Skrillex as \\"Sonny and the Blood Monkeys\\". On June 23, 2009, Hollywood Undead released Swan Songs B-Sides EP through iTunes. The band released a CD/DVD set entitled Desperate Measures on November 10, 2009. The set includes a CD of previously unreleased six new songs, three of which are cover songs, as well a previously unreleased remix of \\"Everywhere I Go\\", and six live recordings of songs from Swan Songs, and a DVD of a full live performance by the band. In December 2009, the band won Best Crunk/Rock Rap Artist at the Rock on Request Awards. In its first week of release, Desperate Measures reached No. 29 on the Billboard 200. It also peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard's Rock Albums chart, No. 8 on the Alternative Albums chart, No. 5 on the Hard Rock albums chart, and No. 15 on the Digital Albums chart.

At a London music hall theatre, Richard Hannay is watching a demonstration of the superlative powers of recall of \\"Mr. Memory\\" (Wylie Watson) when shots are fired. In the ensuing panic, Hannay finds himself holding a seemingly frightened Annabella Smith, who talks him into taking her back to his flat. There, she tells him that she is a spy, being chased by assassins, and that she has uncovered a plot to steal vital British military information, masterminded by a man with the top joint missing from one of his fingers. She mentions the \\"39 Steps\\", but does not explain its meaning. Later that night Smith, fatally stabbed, bursts into Hannay's bedroom and warns him to flee.

Joe Jackson Gibbs (born November 25, 1940) is a former American football coach, current NASCAR Championship team owner, and former NHRA team owner. He was the 20th and 26th head coach in the history of the Washington Redskins (1981-1992, 2004-2007). Well known for his long hours and work ethic, Gibbs constructed what Steve Sabol has called, \\"The most diverse dynasty in NFL history\\", building championship teams with many players who have had mediocre to average careers while playing for other NFL teams. During his first stint in the National Football League, he coached the Redskins for 12 seasons and led them to eight playoff appearances, four NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowl titles. Although Gibbs helped craft a passing-oriented attack during his time in San Diego, his Redskins teams were known to incorporate a smash-mouth, rushing-oriented attack like the counter trey. By building a strong offensive line (known as \\"The Hogs\\") Gibbs was able to control the line of scrimmage, allowing workhorse running backs such as John Riggins, George Rogers, and Earnest Byner to power the ground game. Gibbs added a deep passing attack to this which complemented the ground game, utilizing agile receivers such as Art Monk, Gary Clark, and Ricky Sanders. Gibbs' offense was aided during his tenure by aggressive defensive units under the direction of defensive coordinator Richie Petitbon. Gibbs' system and offensive scheme were robust enough to be successful without a Hall-of-Fame-caliber quarterback at the helm. The Redskins' Super Bowl victories were won featuring Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, and Mark Rypien--capable players who were very successful along with their strong supporting cast. Gibbs is credited with inventing the single back, double or triple tight end set. He used it to neutralize Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor, realizing that to successfully block him with a running back was impossible; an extra tight end and a tackle were required as well. The extra tight end provided additional protection for the quarterback. Gibbs was also credited for creating the Trips formation; stacking three wide receivers to one side. Gibbs incorporated the shifting and motions for which his offenses were known. The formations created mismatches and confusion for the opposing defenses that would then be exploited. He is also one of few coaches that utilized the H-back position prominently in his offense.","completion":"This text is about Joe Jackson Gibbs, a former American football coach, current NASCAR Championship team owner, and former NHRA team owner.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can some viruses do?\\" is \\"death\\", given that some viruses can kill? Possible answers: i. Yes. ii. No. A:","completion":"While \\"death\\" might be an accurate consequence of some viruses, it is not the most comprehensive or informative answer to the question \\"what can some viruses do?\\" First, it is essential to understand what a virus is and its different effects on living organisms. Viruses are unique microorganisms that reside at the boundary between living and non-living entities. Unlike other pathogens, viruses are not capable of reproducing independently, instead, they must invade and hijack a host cell to multiply. In the process of replication, various outcomes can arise, depending on the type of virus and its interaction with the host. A more detailed answer would encompass the diverse nature of viruses and their various abilities, which include, but are not limited to: 1. Cause a range of diseases: While some viruses, such as Ebola and certain strains of influenza, can lead to severe illness and death, others cause milder ailments. For example, the common cold is caused by different viruses like rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, while stomach flu results from noroviruses. Some viruses, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV), may cause warts, increase the risk of certain cancers or even result in asymptomatic infections. 2. Trigger immune response: When a virus infects a host, the immune system responds by attempting to fight off the invasive pathogen. This process can have various effects on the host, including inflammation, fever, and the generation of specific antibodies, which provide immunity against future exposure to the virus. 3. Establish latency: Certain viruses, such as herpesviruses, can establish a latent or dormant infection in the host. This means that the virus remains hidden within the host's body without causing any symptoms, only to reactivate later, potentially leading to recurrent disease or transmission. 4. Integrate into the host DNA: Some viruses, known as retroviruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have the ability to integrate their genetic material into the host's DNA. This integration can disrupt normal cellular functions and contribute to various diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the case of HIV. 5. Act as vectors: Viruses can sometimes serve as carriers for genetic material, introducing new genes or alleles into a host organism. This property has been harnessed in the field of gene therapy and genetic engineering, where modified viruses are used to deliver and integrate exogenous genes into targeted cells for various biomedical and experimental purposes. In summary, although \\"death\\" is one potential outcome of viral infection, it does not fully encapsulate the range of effects caused by viruses. A more accurate and detailed answer would include the various illnesses they can cause, their ability to elicit immune responses, establish latency, integrate into host DNA, and even their potential use as vectors in genetic engineering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less solar panels available happens, how will it affect air is circulated throughout body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case supposes that there is a reduction in the availability of solar panels. To understand whether this perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process of air circulation throughout the body, let's first analyze both components - the air circulation process and the role of solar panels in the environment. The air circulation process in the body, as described in the given sequence, entails breathing in oxygen, which enters the lungs through the bronchial tubes. The oxygen then enters the bloodstream, circulates throughout the body, and is exchanged with carbon dioxide in body cells. The carbon dioxide is returned to the lungs via the bloodstream and is expelled through the nose and mouth. This process is crucial for maintaining life, as it ensures that human cells receive the oxygen they need for energy production and cellular metabolism. On the other hand, solar panels are devices that collect sunlight and convert it into electricity, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable energy supply. They are not directly involved in the biological process of air circulation in the human body. However, it is possible to consider potential indirect effects that may occur from a reduction in the availability of solar panels. If fewer solar panels are available, we may assume that the use of alternative, possibly less environmentally friendly energy sources, such as coal, oil, or natural gas, may increase. The burning of fossil fuels contributes to air pollution by releasing particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other harmful substances, as well as greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Air pollution can have a negative impact on human health, as it can irritate the respiratory system, exacerbate existing respiratory conditions, or even lead to the development of chronic lung disorders. Breathing in polluted air may cause a reduction in the efficiency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs, as pollutants can damage lung tissue and cause inflammation. The overall air circulation throughout the body might be negatively impacted, potentially leading to a decline in overall health and well-being. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis that supposes a reduction in solar panel availability does not directly affect the air circulation process in the human body. However, indirectly, the increased reliance on fossil fuels as an alternative energy source can contribute to air pollution, which can ultimately have an adverse impact on respiratory health and the efficiency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last name of the person who died in Toledo, Spain is Theotokópoulos."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(CNN) -- The battle continues over which court should try the son of deceased Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. In the latest sign of a growing divide, the International Criminal Court on Friday rejected Libya's bid to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and asked the nation to hand him over. Libya has consistently challenged the ICC's demand to try Gadhafi, saying the Hague-based court does not have jurisdiction in the case. Gadhafi, who has been held in the Libyan city of Zintan since his capture in 2011, faces charges of crimes against humanity linked to the uprising that ousted his father about two years ago.

In the given dialogue, the interaction between the two speakers, F and M, revolves around a particular request. F asks M to give a letter to Mary as soon as she arrives. M obliges and confirms that he will do so. From the conversation, it is clear that M is entrusted with the responsibility of delivering the letter to Mary personally when she comes. The first option, \\"To see Mary,\\" may seem plausible at first glance since the man is expected to hand over the letter to her. However, it is not the primary action that the man is going to perform. Instead, he is supposed to give her the letter, indicating that his primary objective is the delivery of the letter, not just to see Mary. The second option, \\"To give a letter to Mary,\\" accurately captures the essence of the conversation. F explicitly asks M to hand the letter to Mary, and M agrees to the request. Thus, it is evident that the man's primary intention is to give the letter to Mary as soon as she appears. The third option, \\"To post the letter,\\" does not align with the dialogue. F requests M to give the letter to Mary when she comes, not to post it. Consequently, mailing the letter is not the assigned task for the man in this interaction.

The novel is the first in the Lorien Legacies series, which consists of seven books, indicating that there is potential for more movies based on the subsequent novels in the series. However, no sequel has been made or announced. The reason for the lack of a sequel is largely due to the underwhelming performance of \\"I Am Number Four\\" at the box office, as mentioned by screenwriter Marti Noxon in the 2011 statement to Collider.com. The film, produced by DreamWorks Pictures, was not a significant commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. As a result, the producers and studio decided not to greenlight a sequel. While there are no plans for an official film sequel, the story continues in the Lorien Legacies book series. The books, in order of release, are as follows: 1. I Am Number Four (2010) 2.

If you've never been to a Yard House, it's a bar/restaurant known for having a lot on tap, a pretty extensive food menu and providing plentiful options for vegans and vegetarians. Their menu is reasonably priced (along with some happy hour specials), especially for Vegas. My favorite thing to do is order 2-3 appetizers and get to try a bunch of different things! My boyfriend and I came here a couple times while visiting Vegas so we got a pretty good read on this location. It looks like the wait for tables can be a little lengthy. We sat at the bar to bypass it all. The service was quick and c'mon, there is SO MUCH on tap here. It's awesome. Not sure where to start? My food recommendations are: -Truffle fries: You really can't go wrong with these. Savory and great for sharing. -Guac and chips: They actually do a pretty solid guac here! Save the excess for smothering on your main course. -Ahi poke bowl: I would definitely ask for soy sauce to go with this, since it's a little bland otherwise. They'll bring you chopsticks if you want, but I basically inhaled this, it was so good! -French onion soup: Yes, I ordered a soup with a straight face at the bar. Twice. This was some of the best French onion soup I've ever had...perfectly flavored and boiling hot, crusted at the top with soup-absorbed bread and bubbling cheese. Yum.

It's just friendly in general, as they also point out low calorie options on the menu, but I digress. Hands down, my favorite Gardein dish is the wings.

An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his work \\"The Republic\\". Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like John Locke argued for the theory of natural law. Thinkers in the social contract tradition argued that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill argued that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the \\"proper\\" distribution. Egalitarians argued that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) take a deontological view of distributive justice and argue that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called \\"reparative justice\\") is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.

Which country declared war on Japan - the day before the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki?","completion":"The country that declared war on Japan the day before the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki is the Soviet Union. The end of World War II is largely marked by two pivotal events: the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States, and the invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, a second atomic bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki. However, an event of equal significance took place between these two attacks. On August 8, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. After Germany's surrender in May 1945, the Allies shifted their focus to the Pacific Theater. The Soviet Union had been asked by the other Allies to join the Pacific War and they had agreed during the Yalta Conference that they would intervene on the Allies' side against Japan three months after Germany's surrender. Thus, the Soviet Union declared war to meet the terms agreed upon at the Yalta Conference. It should be noted that this was happening while the Potsdam Conference (which Japan was not a party to) was underway, where the Allies (including the Soviet Union) at Potsdam called on Japan to surrender unconditionally. After its declaration of war, the Soviet Union launched the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, sometimes known as the Battle of Manchuria. The campaign was one of the largest of the Soviet–Japanese War and ended in a decisive victory for the Soviet Union, Mongolia and China. The twin shocks of the Soviet Union entering the war and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki pushed Japan toward surrender. While the debate continues about which event had a bigger influence on Japan's decision to surrender, the fact remains that these two events brought about the end of World War II. The Japanese government officially announced its surrender on August 15, 1945, and the formal signing of surrender documents took place aboard the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945. The entry of the Soviet Union into the Pacific War against Japan and the atomic bombings played crucial roles in ending the most devastating conflict in human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How it feels when teacher ask to leave the class (in fact get out)? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choices: i. no. ii. yes.","completion":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. They both address the feelings and emotions experienced when a teacher asks a student to leave the class. The questions may be phrased differently, but they share the same core subject. When a teacher asks a student to leave the class, the feelings one experiences can vary depending on the individual student's personality, the circumstances behind being asked to leave, and the overall class dynamics. Common emotions experienced in such a situation include: 1. Embarrassment: It's only natural to feel embarrassed when singled out in front of others, as it highlights that the student has done something wrong or unacceptable. Embarrassment often arises from a perceived loss of dignity or a slight to one's reputation. 2. Shame: Similar to embarrassment, shame occurs when one internalizes negative feelings about their actions or behavior. In this case, the student might feel genuine remorse for their conduct in class and might reflect on their actions to avoid future similar situations. 3. Anger or frustration: Some students might react with anger or frustration, particularly if they feel the teacher's request to leave the class is undeserved or unjust. This could lead to feelings of resentment toward the teacher or even the entire school environment. 4. Fear or anxiety: Being asked to leave the class can make a student feel uneasy about what consequences may follow, such as parental involvement, loss of privileges, or a negative impact on their academic record. Fear or anxiety may also arise if the student is unsure of how to navigate the situation or deal with the repercussions. 5. Relief: In some cases, a student may feel relief at being asked to leave the class. They could be struggling with class material, dealing with personal issues, or simply feeling overwhelmed, and the opportunity to step outside momentarily might offer some peace and clarity. 6. Isolation: When a student is asked to leave a class, it can create a sense of separation from the rest of the group. This feeling of isolation may be particularly strong for individuals who have difficulty connecting with their peers or who are already struggling with feelings of loneliness. It is essential to remember that the emotions listed are dependent on the circumstances and individual temperament. Each student's experience will differ, and it's crucial to recognize and empathize with a student's feelings when asked to leave a class. Open communication between the student, teacher, and, if necessary, parents and other supportive figures may help resolve the situation and reduce the negative impact of being asked to leave the class."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Article: Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh in Scotland in 1850. He had to end his college studies because his health was poor. He began to travel, looking for a place that was good for his health. And he wrote about his travels. Inland Voyage(1878) was about journeys by canoe on the rivers and canals of Belgium and France. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes followed it in next year. People loved his travel books, and they also found his poems beautiful. In 1879 he travelled to California in a very uncomfortable ship and then by train across the United States to San Francisco. He married in California, but his poor health made him and his wife travel again. Readers of his travel books and poetry were surprised when Treasure Island came out in 1883. It was not at all like his earlier writing, but both children and grown-ups loved it. Treasure Island was finished in Switzerland. Stevenson then continued to travel. He loved the islands of the southern Pacific Ocean, and he found that his health was better there. In the end, he and his wife made their home in Samoa. It was there that he wrote Kidnapped(1886), the story of David Balfour and Alan Breck. It was followed (but not immediately) by Catriona, which continues the story of David Belfour and tells of other exciting adventures of David and Alan, and of David's love for Catriona Drummond. In between the two stories about David Belfour came another surprising book, the \\"thriller\\" called The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson died in Samoa in 1894, and he is buried there. Question: Stevenson settled in Samoa because _ .

Context: On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the United States that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the United States crossed the 38th parallel. Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively.

Science/Tech;","completion":"This article is about: (c). Business. Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, is one of the leading mortgage companies in the United States. Together with Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, they hold a significant share of the mortgage market. These two financial behemoths are key players in the business world, especially in the housing finance sector. The article in question seems to deal with accounting issues that have been discovered at Fannie Mae, which could potentially affect the company's financial performance and business standing. The mention of lagging reform efforts in Congress also indicates that the topic is related to business and finance regulation. Hence, it falls under the category of Business. To understand better, let's delve deeper into the background of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and their significance in the business world, along with the potential implications of the mentioned accounting artifices. 1. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that help provide liquidity to the US mortgage market. They purchase home loans from banks and other lenders, package them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and sell them to investors. By doing so, they ensure that banks have the necessary funds to continue lending to homebuyers. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the US housing market, which has immense impact on the nation's economy. 2. Political influence and involvement: Being government-sponsored entities, they are subject to political considerations as well. Their strong lobbying efforts and influence on policymakers make them a significant force in the world of business and finance. 3. The impact of accounting discrepancies: The article refers to \\"Fannie Mae's newly discovered accounting artifices,\\" which suggests that there have been some questionable accounting practices discovered within the company. The impact of these accounting issues could have wide-ranging implications, including potential financial penalties, legal action, or regulatory changes that could affect Fannie Mae's business operations, financial performance, and investor relations. The fact that this development is mentioned as something that could give \\"lagging reform efforts in Congress some impetus,\\" suggests a possibility of renewed calls for regulatory changes related to mortgage giants, which can further impact the business and financial landscape. In summary, given the focus on Fannie Mae's accounting practices and the potential implications for regulatory reforms and the company's overall business operations, it is clear that the topic of this article belongs to the category of Business."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain. The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that. Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent. Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent.

How do you make bait to put inside a homemade soda can wasp trap?","completion":"Alright, let me explain how to make bait for a homemade soda can wasp trap, step by step! 1. First, we will need a sweet liquid to attract the wasps. You can use any sugary drink like soda, fruit juice, or even sugar water. If you are using sugar water, mix 1 part sugar with 1 part water. Stir it until all the sugar dissolves. 2. Now, let's add a pinch of protein to make it more attractive to the wasps. You can use tiny bits of meat, like lunch meat or hotdog, or even pet food. Add a little bit of this protein into your sweet liquid to make the perfect bait. 3. To create the trap, take an empty soda can and rinse it out well so that it's clean. Next, cut a small hole in the side of the can, near the top. Make sure this hole is big enough for wasps to enter but not so big that they can easily fly out. 4. Pour your bait (the sweet liquid with protein) into the soda can, filling it about halfway. 5. Set your soda can trap up in a place where you have seen wasps, like near their nest or your picnic area. Make sure it's a safe place where kids and pets won't touch it. 6. Wait patiently! The wasps should soon be attracted to the lovely bait inside your soda can. They'll go inside to get to the bait, but have a hard time finding the hole to come back out. Eventually, they'll get trapped inside. Remember to check and empty the trap often, so that it stays effective in catching the wasps. And don't forget to be careful when handling the trap, as the wasps inside may still be able to sting you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I? , can you please find it? A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I is Philip the Good. He was a significant patron of the arts, especially illuminated manuscripts, and his extensive library helped establish the manuscript industry in the Lowlands, laying the foundation for the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.

Identify the type of polish: Guitar wax or polish is specifically designed for use on guitars and contains the right formulation to enhance the guitar's appearance. Piano wax or polish is designed for pianos and may not be suitable for a guitar's finish. 2. Get a suitable rag: Find a clean, soft, lint-free cloth or rag to apply the polish. This will prevent any damage or scratches to the guitar's surface. 3. Test the polish: Before applying the guitar wax or polish to the entire guitar, test a small amount on a discrete area like the back of the guitar to ensure it doesn't harm the guitar's finish. 4. Apply the polish: If the test area looks good and the finish isn't damaged, gently apply the guitar wax or polish to the entire surface of the guitar using the soft rag. Use small, circular motions to spread the product evenly. 5. Remove excess polish: After allowing the wax or polish to sit on the guitar for the recommended time, gently remove any excess product with a clean, dry section of the rag. This will prevent any build-up or residue on the guitar's surface. 6. Buff the guitar: Once the excess polish has been removed, use another clean, dry section of the rag to buff the guitar's surface. This process will enhance the guitar's shine. By following these steps, the wooden guitar will have an increased shine and look better overall.

Bowe Bergdahl has described in his own words the brutal conditions he endured as a Taliban prisoner for five years, a time during which he said he was kept in constant isolation. Bergdahl also claims he attempted to escape about a dozen times including once where he was able to evade his captors for nine days before being recaptured. Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Bergdahl walked away from his unit's outpost in eastern Afghanistan in June, 2009 and was held captive by the Taliban until last May when his freedom was secured in a controversial prisoner swap for five former Taliban leaders being detained at Guantanamo. On Wednesday the Army charged Bergdahl with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy; he could face life in prison for the latter charge. Bergdahl’s account of his captivity was included in a statement provided to reporters by his attorney Eugene Fidell, who told ABC News it details “the really atrocious conditions in which he was held” and the worsening treatment after his escape attempts. “I think those are important facts that decision makers will take into account when they figure out how this case should be disposed of,” said Fidell. “I was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years, with little to no understanding of time, through periods of constant darkness, periods of constant light, and periods of completely random flickering of light, and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening behind the door I was held behind,\\" wrote Bergdahl in the single-spaced two-page statement. He said that in the first three months of his captivity after his two escape attempts “I was chained to a bed spread-eagle and blindfolded.” He remained constantly blindfolded except for the few times a day when he was allowed to eat and use the latrine. As his muscles atrophied and it became difficult for him to walk his captors allowed him to sit chained on the bed. He eventually developed open wounds on his ankles “that looked like the staph infection I had had earlier that year.” Voice Of Jihad Website/AP video He also began to develop what he called a “growing internal sickness\\" that made it difficult for him to eat for the rest of his captivity and led to a dramatic weight loss. After a year of captivity he was placed in a cage with his hands in chains except for the few times when he would wash or change clothes. For a year his feet were chained to the cage every night though that ended “because of the acute pain my feet and legs where [sic] in.” He claims that pain had developed into a “freezing numbness that continues to the present, as both feet have neuropathy.” He would spend the rest of his captivity in the cage, but unshackled only because it was placed over plumbing that allowed him to relieve himself. His captors would routinely play mind games with him telling him he would be executed one day, “told I would leave the next day, and the next day told I would be there for 30 years.” Bergdahl claims he attempted to escape from his captors about a dozen times, the first one taking place just hours after he was captured in 2009 in eastern Afghanistan. Taken to a village, he claims a Taliban fighter began punching him each time he evaded his questions. Blindfolded with a blanket over his head “I believed I had a chance to run for it and did.” But he was soon brought down by a large group of men who repeatedly punched him including one who used the butt stock of a broken AK-47. He twice was able to escape beyond the buildings where he was being held. The first time during his first week in captivity when he escaped for 10 to 15 minutes “and after recapturing me and putting chains back on they took turns beating me with a length of thick robber [sic] hose.” Bergdahl said the escape attempt led to his being taken to a more secured compound. His most daring escape occurred at the end of his first year of captivity when he was able to evade his captors for nine days. “Without food and only putrid water to drink, my body failed on top of a short mountain close to evening.” He was recaptured a short time later by a large Taliban search group that proceeded to beat him severely. “One tried to rip my beard and hair out, but from what I could sense they where [sic} more worried about getting me out of that area as quickly as possible.” ||||| Washington (CNN) House Speaker John Boehner said Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" after the U.S. military charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, but emphasized in an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash that he was more concerned about the circumstances of his release. Bergdahl's attorney also released a statement on Wednesday, outlining his defense of the soldier and containing a two-page letter from Bergdahl describing the torture he endured, which included months spent chained to a bed and further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage. Shortly after the charges were announced, Bergdahl's attorneys released a lengthy statement that includes a letter sent to Milley earlier this month outlining their defense of the soldier. \\"In light of the nearly five years of harsh captivity Sgt. Bergdahl endured, the purpose of his leaving his unit, and his behavior while a prisoner, it would be unduly harsh to impose on him the lifetime stigma of a court-martial conviction or an other than honorable discharge and to deny him veterans benefits,\\" attorney Eugene R. Fidell writes in the letter. The statement includes a two-page accounting from Bergdahl of his time in captivity, in which he recounts months spent chained to a bed, then further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage. Bergdahl said for years his body and health declined due to malnourishment, and sores on his wrists and ankles from the shackles grew infected. \\"My body started a steady decline in constant internal sickness that would last through the final year,\\" he said. Bergdahl was frequently beaten, at times with copper wire or a thick rubber hose, and forced to watch Taliban videos, he said. He had no concept of time, and was repeatedly told he would be killed and would never again see his family. \\"I was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years, with little to no understanding of time, through periods of constant darkness, periods of constant light, and periods of completely random flickering of light and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening beyond the door I was held behind,\\" he wrote. Bergdahl tried a dozen times to escape, he wrote. In his interview with Bash, Boehner said \\"like any American, you're innocent until proven guilty.\\" \\"And these charges are coming. There will be a trial,\\" Boehner said in an interview taped Wednesday to air Sunday on CNN's \\"State of the Union.\\" Boehner said the \\"more troubling part\\" of Bergdahl saga is the fact that the U.S. government traded five Taliban fighters for Bergdahl's release, and that recent reports indicate one has returned to the battlefield. He expressed concerns about other detainees held at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, which President Barack Obama is working to close, \\"ending up back on the battlefield and threatening Americans here and abroad.\\" Obama \\"violated the law\\" in failing to alert Congress before the prisoner swap occurred, Boehner added. \\"And I still believe that's the more troubling part of this,\\" he said. \\"We've made clear in the past that we won't negotiate with terrorists, and but yet here we did.\\" Military officials announced Wednesday afternoon they would charge Bergdahl with one count each of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Bergdahl left his post in Afghanistan before being captured and held captive for five years. For that, he faces charges that carry a maximum penalty of life in a military prison, and he could also have to forfeit pay and be stripped of his rank, Army Col. Daniel King said as he announced the charges. Bergdahl faces a military procedure similar to a grand jury that will whether charges are appropriate, King said. Then, he could face court martial proceedings. The decision comes nearly a year after Bergdahl returned to the United States as part of a prisoner exchange and since the Army began a formal investigation into his disappearance from his unit in eastern Afghanistan in June 2009. The Army concluded its investigation into the circumstances of Bergdahl's capture in December. Until now, it has been in the hands of Gen. Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command, who made the decision to charge Bergdahl. Several U.S. military officials CNN has spoken with suggested privately that the process took longer than expected. Ahead of Wednesday's announcement, officials said Milley only had a few choices. Though the sense had been that Bergdahl must be held accountable for his actions, there had been little appetite for a lengthy term in military confinement given the five years Bergdahl was held by the Taliban.

But the circumstances of Bergdahl's departure from his base and how willingly he left have not been clear. King said he couldn't offer those details on Wednesday, and that they're being treated as evidence for the upcoming proceedings against Bergdahl. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, called the charges an \\"important step\\" on Wednesday. \\"This is an important step in the military justice process towards determining the accountability of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl,\\" he said in a statement. \\"I am confident that the Department of the Army will continue to ensure this process is conducted with the utmost integrity under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, meanwhile, lambasted the \\"unevenness\\" of Obama's swap of five Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl. \\"I wouldn't have done this trade for a Medal of Honor winner,\\" he told CNN. \\"No military member should expect their country to turn over five Taliban commanders to get their release. Nobody should expect that. It's not the nature of his service that drives my thinking it's just the illogical nature of the swap.\\" Some members of Bergdahl's platoon have criticized him, labeling Bergdahl a deserter. \\"I was pissed off then, and I am even more so now with everything going on,\\" former Sgt. Matt Vierkant, a member of Bergdahl's platoon when he went missing on June 30, 2009, told CNN last year. \\"Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war, and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him.\\" Bergdahl was freed in May when President Barack Obama agreed to swap five Taliban prisoners who had been detained in Guantanamo Bay to secure Bergdahl's freedom, sending those detainees to Qatar. Obama announced Bergdahl's release to fanfare in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by the Army sergeant's parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl. His hometown of Hailey, Idaho, had planned a parade to celebrate Bergdahl's homecoming but later canceled that celebration amid security concerns stemming from the unanswered questions surrounding his disappearance and the resulting controversy over his release. After returning to the United States, Bergdahl had been on active duty at an administrative job at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. There, the Army assigned Bergdahl a \\"sponsor\\" to help him adjust to life in his new post. Upon returning, Bergdahl refused to meet with his parents -- and months later, Army officials had said he was communicating with them but still had not met them face to face. The five figures the United States exchanged to secure Bergdahl's release were Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Nori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were mostly mid- to high-level officials in the Taliban regime and had been detained early in the war in Afghanistan because of their positions within the Taliban, not because of ties to al Qaeda. The detainee swap for Bergdahl has become increasingly controversial in recent weeks after a report published by the office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said one of the 17 intelligence agencies operating under its umbrella had judged that a prisoner released in the exchange had since contacted the Taliban. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive by the Taliban for five years, described the really harsh conditions of his captivity. He shared that he was kept in constant isolation, in constant darkness or light, chained and blindfolded, and faced frequent beatings. He said he attempted to escape about twelve times and once managed to avoid capture for nine days. Bergdahl had previously walked away from his Army outpost in Afghanistan in 2009 and was later freed in 2014 in a controversial prisoner exchange where the US released five Taliban leaders. But, after his return, the Army charged him with desertion and misbehavior. If found guilty, he might face life in prison. His attorney has provided his account to decision makers as part of his defense case. He hopes that knowing how Bergdahl was treated will impact the decision about his charges. Also, Bergdahl's health significantly declined during his captivity because of malnutrition and infections from his chains. He was regularly threatened with execution and was continuously played mind games with, being told variously that he would go home, stay for 30 years, or be killed. The US government's decision to trade five Taliban fighters for Bergdahl's release has raised concerns as reports suggest one of those fighters has returned to battle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function, and microRNA has a regulatory role. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Ribozymes are unique RNA molecules possessing catalytic capabilities that allow them to carry out a variety of functions within the cell. Unlike most RNA molecules that function as messengers and templates in protein synthesis, ribozymes are able to perform enzymatic reactions typically reserved for proteins. The discovery of ribozymes has shed light on RNA's versatile nature and its potential for prebiotic life, as well as importance in the evolution of cells. Some of the primary functions of ribozymes include the following: 1. Catalyzing critical cellular processes: Ribozymes play an essential role in many crucial cellular processes, including the synthesis and modification of other RNA molecules. For example, the ribosome, which synthesizes proteins, is made up of a large ribonucleoprotein complex containing ribozymes that facilitate peptide bond formation between amino acids. 2. RNA splicing: Introns, the non-coding regions of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) molecules, need to be removed before the mRNA is translated into proteins. Ribozymes, such as the Group I and Group II introns, can catalyze their splicing reactions, excising themselves and ligating the adjacent exons together. The spliceosome, a large RNA-protein complex, also contains ribozymes responsible for conducting the splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. 3. tRNA processing: One of the foundational participants in the protein synthesis process is transfer RNA (tRNA). Some ribozymes are involved in tRNA maturation, including the removal of the 5' leader sequences and the addition of the essential \\"CCA\\" sequence at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule. 4. RNA replication: In some RNA viruses, ribozymes can participate in RNA replication, mainly by catalyzing the cleavage of precursor RNA molecules and facilitating new RNA strand synthesis. 5. Gene regulation: Ribozymes can also be involved in gene regulation through processes like RNA interference (RNAi). Here, small regulatory RNA molecules guide ribonucleoprotein complexes, which contain ribozymes, to bind and cleave target messenger RNAs, thus modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. 6. Catalytic aptamers: Certain ribozymes, called catalytic aptamers, are capable of binding and catalyzing reactions on small molecules, such as cofactors, metal ions, and metabolites. Some examples include the glmS ribozyme, which functions in the regulation of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthesis, and the hammerhead ribozyme, which is involved in the processing of certain viral RNAs. In summary, ribozymes are multifunctional RNA molecules capable of catalyzing various biological reactions. They play a critical role in many cellular processes such as RNA splicing, tRNA processing, RNA replication, and gene regulation. The versatility and significance of ribozymes have broadened our understanding of RNA's central role in cellular biology and evolution, making them a fascinating area of study."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you live in a temperate or warm climate, nearly all plant nurseries in your area should sell jacaranda seedlings. If you need help locating a jacaranda plant, or if a nursery has different options to choose from, ask the sales staff for assistance. If there isn’t a plant nursery in your area, you can also visit the Garden section of large retail stores. Retailers like WalMart and Home Depot will stock a large variety of plants, and will likely carry jacaranda seedlings. If you don’t live near a nursery or garden center, there may not be a way for you to purchase a jacaranda seedling in person. In this case, you can find and order a jacaranda online. Check major online plant retailers, such as Annie’s Annuals, Fast Growing Trees, or Nursery Live. Certain retailers will provide a seedling—with others, you may need to order a packet of seeds. Although jacarandas commonly grow in temperate or humid climates, they can survive in cooler areas as well—even regions that receive light frosts. Jacaranda trees grow best in zone 10 in the hardiness scale, which includes warmer climates. If you know a friend or relative with a jacaranda tree, ask if you can take a cutting of their plant. A cutting is segment taken from a branch; the cutting itself should be at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, but can be as long as you would like. Place the jacaranda cutting in water until small roots begin to emerge. Then, plant the cutting in a small pot filled with rich soil, water regularly, and let the tree grow. Jacaranda seedlings also tend to spring up around the base of mature jacaranda trees.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: What are some causes of a small lump in my earlobe? A small lump in the earlobe can be caused by several factors, which may include the following: 1. Epidermoid cyst: Also called a sebaceous cyst, an epidermoid cyst is a common, benign (non-cancerous) lump filled with dead skin cells and keratin. It appears under the skin and is usually painless, but may become painful if infected. 2. Pimple or acne: Blocked hair follicles can result in the formation of a pimple or a small, red, and sometimes painful lump. 3. Trauma or injury: A minor injury or trauma to the earlobe can cause a small lump or swelling. 4. Keloid: A keloid is an overgrown scar that occurs when the body overproduces collagen, forming a smooth, hard, raised lump after an injury. 5. Infection: Bacterial or fungal infections can cause small lumps in the earlobe. Infections may be painful or accompanied by discharge. 6. Piercings: A lump near an ear piercing could be due to an irritation or infection from the jewelry or improper healing. 7. Lipoma: A lipoma is a soft, fatty growth that occurs just below the skin, forming a rounded lump. Lipomas are benign and usually painless. 8. Benign or cancerous growth: Although rare, a small lump in the earlobe could be a result of a benign or cancerous growth. Question 2: Why do I have a lump in my neck? A lump in the neck can be caused by various factors, some of which include: 1. Lymph nodes: Swollen lymph nodes are the most common cause of neck lumps. Lymph nodes can become enlarged for several reasons, such as infections, inflammation, or cancer. 2. Thyroid disorders: An enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) can cause a lump in your neck. Thyroid disorders that can lead to a goiter include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or thyroid nodules. 3. Cysts: Cysts in the neck area can develop as a result of trapped cells, fluid, or other substances. Thyroglossal duct cysts and branchial cleft cysts are examples of neck cysts. 4. Lipoma: A lipoma is a soft, fatty growth that occurs just below the skin, forming a rounded lump. Lipomas can develop anywhere on the body, including the neck. 5. Infections: Bacterial or viral infections can cause neck lumps. Infections in oral tissues, such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or dental abscesses, can lead to swollen lymph nodes in the neck area. 6. Cancer: Although rare, a lump in your neck could be caused by cancer, such as thyroid cancer, lymphoma, or cancer that has spread from another part of the body. Comparing the two questions, it is clear that they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is specifically asking about the causes of a small lump in the earlobe, whereas Question 2 is concerned with the causes of a lump in the neck area. While some potential reasons for the lumps may overlap, such as infection or lipomas, the specific causes and associated conditions for each location are different."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reasoning may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the lawand respect for rule of lawunder which the social group is governed. Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion. - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada.

Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - Alfred Griner \`\` Alferd '' Packer ( January 21 , 1842 -- April 23 , 1907 ) was an American prospector who confessed to cannibalism during the winter of 1874 . He and 5 other men attempted to travel through the high mountains of Colorado during the peak of a harsh winter . When only Alfred reached civilization , he claimed that the others had killed each other for food , and confessed to having lived off the flesh of his companions during his snowbound state and to having used it to survive his trek out of the mountains two months later . After his story was called into question , he hid from justice for 9 years before being tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to death . Packer won a retrial and was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison for manslaughter . A biopic of his life , The Legend of Alfred Packer , was made in 1980 . A more comedic take entitled Cannibal ! The Musical was made in 1993 . - Sexual cannibalism is when a female cannibalizes her mate prior to, during, or after copulation. It is a phenomenon characterized primarily by members of most arachnid orders, as well as several insect orders. The adaptive foraging hypothesis, aggressive spillover hypothesis and mistaken identity hypothesis are among the proposed theories to explain how sexual cannibalism evolved. This behavior is believed to have evolved as a manifestation of sexual conflict, occurring when the reproductive interests of males and females differ. In many species that exhibit sexual cannibalism, the female consumes the male upon detection. Females of cannibalistic species are generally hostile and unwilling to mate; thus many males of these species have developed adaptive behaviors to counteract female aggression. - The Western United States, commonly referred to as the American West, the Far West, or simply the West, traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States. Because European settlement in the U.S. expanded westward after its founding, the meaning of the West has evolved over time. Prior to about 1800, the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier. - Cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal.

It is loosely based on the true story of Alferd Packer and the sordid details of the trip from Utah to Colorado that left his five fellow travelers dead and partially eaten. Trey Parker (credited as Juan Schwartz) stars as Alferd Packer, with frequent collaborators Stone, Dian Bachar, and others playing the supporting roles. - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor. - South Park is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the television network, Comedy Central. The show revolves around four boysStan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormickand their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.

Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them. It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading. Douglas insists that \\"reading cannot be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible.\\" Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes. They differ in kind and function. The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read. Teaching is also a public activity. It can be seen and observed. Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language. Almost all of it is private, for learning is an occupation of the mind, and that process is not open to public scrutiny. If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable, what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest for knowledge? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions. \\"Make learning to read easy, which means making reading a meaningful, enjoyable and frequent experience for children.\\" When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are, and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately, then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Density is also an important physical property of matter. The concept of density combines what we know about an objects mass and volume. Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video. After reading the above, is \\"Watching a car drive\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What are three examples of density given in the article?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"Watching a car drive\\" is not one of the examples of density given in the article. The three examples of density-related phenomena mentioned in the article are: 1. Helium balloons rising: This occurs because helium is less dense than air. When a balloon is filled with helium, the overall density of the balloon becomes less than the surrounding air. Due to this difference in density, the balloon experiences a buoyant force, causing it to rise. 2. Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream: Density differences in ocean water, which are primarily influenced by temperature and salinity, create pressure gradients. These gradients drive the movement of water, forming currents like the Gulf Stream. Warmer, less dense water tends to flow toward colder, denser regions, while colder, denser water sinks and moves beneath the warmer water layers. 3. Floating or sinking of objects in water: This is determined by relative densities of the objects and water. If an object has a lower density than water, it will experience a buoyant force greater than its own weight, causing it to float. On the other hand, if an object has a higher density than water, the buoyant force will be less than its weight, causing it to sink. The video mentioned in the article is another example involving the interaction between vegetable oil and water. Since vegetable oil has a lower density than water, it floats on top of water, creating a visually appealing demonstration of density differences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the next sentence for this paragraph. (CNN)It is difficult to know at what point things of horror become forgotten and slip out of the world's view. Perhaps it is when they are eclipsed by another, seemingly more pressing crisis. Or when it becomes almost impossible -- for safety or other reasons -- for outside observers to bear witness to their daily toll. Aleppo has, somehow, sometime between late 2012 when it was the open sore of the Syrian civil war, and today -- when the fight against ISIS has completely grabbed the world's attention span -- slipped off the radar screen. But here is why it must not: there remain an estimated 300,000 civilians there, in rebel-held areas alone. And as in so much of Syria's war, it has been that way for months and will probably go on so, as the outcome is so vital that nobody is prepared to give up: the fight for a small hill called OPTIONS: - Aleppo. - CNN. - Handarat. - ISIS. - Syrian.","completion":"The appropriate next sentence for the given paragraph would be: Handarat. Here's why: The paragraph discusses the horrors in Aleppo that have been largely forgotten due to the world's focus shifting towards ISIS. It also mentions that the fight against this forgotten crisis will persist because the outcome is vital. This implies that the ensuing sentence should name or detail a specific locus of such fight. Among the options given, ISIS and CNN aren't apt since ISIS is something else the world is focusing on, not the forgotten crisis, while CNN is merely the publisher. The place under discussion is Aleppo, so repeating it doesn't add new information. 'Syrian' might seem like a contender, but it doesn't specifically add depth to where the conflict is occurring, which we can presume the concluding sentence should discuss. Given the context, Handarat, which is a strategic location near Aleppo and an actual point of conflict during the Syrian civil war, is the optimal choice to bridge the discorso, providing precise information and moving the narrative forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll in a plant - The light energy is used to convert carbon dioxide - The plant uses nutrients in the soil - The plant uses carbon dioxide in the air to produce glucose - The plant uses the glucose to give itself energy - Oxygen is released as a by product. Question: suppose more light energy absorbed happens, how will it affect more sugar produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If more light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll in a plant, it can lead to an increase in the production of glucose, or sugar, through the process of photosynthesis. This is because the additional light energy provides the plant with a greater capacity to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. The relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis is, however, not a direct linear one because at a certain point, the rate of photosynthesis plateaus as it becomes limited by other factors like carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and nutrients. Regarding the second effect mentioned, which is the use of carbon dioxide to produce glucose, the increased absorption of light energy will likely have a positive effect on the process. As the plant absorbs more light energy, it has more energy available to power the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose. This enhanced rate of photosynthesis, in turn, increases the overall efficiency and productivity of the conversion process, leading to the production of more sugar for the plant's energy needs. However, as mentioned earlier, the rate of photosynthesis depends on various factors, including the availability of carbon dioxide. If the carbon dioxide concentration in the vicinity of the plant does not increase or is not sufficient to match the increased light energy absorbed, the plant may not be able to optimize the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose even if it has enough energy to do so. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of increased light energy absorption can lead to more sugar produced in a plant, but this effect might be limited by other factors like carbon dioxide availability, temperature, and nutrients. To optimize sugar production in response to increased light energy absorption, a balanced supply of all these necessary ingredients is essential for the plant to achieve its full potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But I also know that it hasn't always been easy for you and Mom, and that as excited as you both are about that new puppy, it doesn't make up for all the time we've been apart. I know how much I've missed these past two years, and today I want to tell you a little more about why I decided to take our family on this _ When I was a young man, I thought life was all about me--about how I'd make my way in the world, become successful, and get the things I want. But then the two of you came into my world with all your curiosity and mischief and those smiles that never fail to fill my heart and light up my day. And suddenly, all my big plans for myself didn't seem so important anymore. I soon found that the greatest joy in my life was the joy I saw in yours. And I realized that my own life wouldn't count for much unless I was able to ensure that you had every opportunity for happiness and fulfillment in yours. In the end, girls, that's why I ran for President: because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation. I want all our children to go to schools worthy of their potential--schools that challenge them, inspire them, and instill in them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want them to have the chance to go to college--even if their parents aren't rich. And I want them to get good jobs: jobs that pay well and give them benefits like health care, jobs that let them spend time with their own kids and retire with dignity. I want us to push the boundaries of discovery so that you'll live to see new technologies and inventions that improve our lives and make our planet cleaner and safer. And I want us to push our own human boundaries to reach beyond the divides of race and region, gender and religion that keep us from seeing the best in each...

Robin Williams was sober but was struggling with depression, anxiety and the early stages of Parkinson's disease when he died, his widow said Thursday. The diagnosis of the progressive illness was \\"an additional fear and burden in his life,\\" a person familiar with Williams' family told CNN on Thursday. Williams was found dead in his Northern California home Monday from what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging. While fans and friends have looked for answers to why the 63-year-old comedy icon would take his own life, his wife, Susan Schneider, issued a written statement about Williams' health that he had kept a secret. \\"Since his passing, all of us who loved Robin have found some solace in the tremendous outpouring of affection and admiration for him from the millions of people whose lives he touched,\\" Schneider said. \\"His greatest legacy, besides his three children, is the joy and happiness he offered to others, particularly to those fighting personal battles. \\"Robin's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson's disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly. \\"It is our hope in the wake of Robin's tragic passing, that others will find the strength to seek the care and support they need to treat whatever battles they are facing so they may feel less afraid.\\" Williams had been active as an actor in the last year of his life, performing in a CBS sitcom that was canceled this year and acting in four films that have yet to hit theaters. It is not clear whether the early-stage Parkinson's disease affected his ability to work. \\"Friends and family can usually detect changes in the Parkinson's patient including poor posture, loss of balance, and abnormal facial expressions,\\" according to the National Parkinson Foundation. \\"During this initial phase of the disease, a patient usually experiences mild symptoms. These symptoms may inconvenience the day-to-day tasks the patient would otherwise complete with ease. Typically these symptoms will include the presence of tremors or experiencing shaking in one of the limbs.\\" Parkinson's disease \\"causes certain brain cells to die,\\" according to the website of the National Institutes of Health. It is more likely to affect men than women and most often develops after age 50. Williams used exercise and cycling to manage his stress and depression, and the prospect that the illness would prevent him from doing that was extremely upsetting, adding to the depression, the person familiar with his family said. What is Parkinson's disease? Fellow actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's and established the Michael J. Fox Foundation, said Thursday that he was unaware of his friend's condition. \\"Stunned to learn Robin had PD. Pretty sure his support for our Fdn predated his diagnosis. A true friend; I wish him peace,\\" Fox tweeted. Investigators believe Williams used a belt to hang himself from a bedroom door sometime between late Sunday and when his personal assistant found him just before noon Monday, according to Marin County Assistant Deputy Chief Coroner Lt. Keith Boyd. Boyd would not confirm or deny whether Williams left behind a letter, saying that investigators would discuss \\"the note or a note\\" later. The coroner's investigation \\"revealed he had been seeking treatment for depression,\\" Boyd said. He spent time in a treatment facility in July, a time when his wife and representative have said he was battling depression. Media reports at the time speculated that Williams had resumed drinking alcohol, but the statement from his wife appears to dispute those reports. Williams entered rehab because of drug and alcohol addiction at least twice previously. \\"Robin spent so much of his life helping others,\\" his wife said.

The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. In some nations, under doctrines of separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case. In other nations, the judiciary can make law, known as Common Law, by setting precedent for other judges to follow, as opposed to Statutory Law made by the legislature. The Judiciary is often tasked with ensuring equal justice under law. - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced.

Write an article based on this summary: The Paris attacks have once again revealed the West's bewilderment as to why it is under attack.","completion":"Title: Why is the West Under Attack? A Simple Explanation of the Paris Attacks Once upon a time, there were many countries in the world. Some of these countries were in a place called the West. One day, something bad happened in the city of Paris, which is in a country called France, in the West. Many people were hurt, and some even lost their lives. This made everyone very sad. People couldn't understand why this had happened and wondered why it took place in the West. To help us understand why the West is under attack, let's first talk about what the West is. The \\"West\\" is a way of describing some countries that are in Europe and North America. These countries are often called \\"western\\" because when you look at a map of the world, they are on the left side or the \\"west\\" side. These countries include places like France, the United States, and the United Kingdom. There are different reasons why some people might want to cause harm in the West. Many times, these people feel angry about the choices that countries in the West make. This could be because of the way western countries run their governments, treat other people around the world, or even choose what is right and wrong. Some of the people who are unhappy with the West blame them for the problems in their own countries. These problems might include things like not having enough food, not being able to find a good job, or feeling like their voices aren't being heard. To express their anger and frustration, these people sometimes decide to hurt others. In the case of the Paris attacks, a group of individuals who were very mad at the West planned and carried out the attacks. They wanted to hurt the people in Paris to show their anger and let everyone know that they didn't like the choices that the West was making. Now, it's important to remember that not everyone who is unhappy with the West will choose to hurt other people. There are many ways to share your feelings or try to make changes without causing harm. For example, people can form groups to talk and discuss their problems or use their voices to say what they think is right. We also need to remember that the West is made up of many people who come from different places, believe in different things, and have different opinions. It's not fair to blame all the people who live in the West for the choices their governments make or the actions of a few individuals. In the end, understanding why the West is under attack is not easy, nor is it the same for everyone. We need to listen carefully to what people are saying and learn from their feelings and ideas. By doing so, we can work together to find ways to improve the world and make sure everybody is living happily and peacefully."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And when the food ran out,they would move off somewhere else. He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals.This was an important discovery,because by learning to cultivate the land,and care for animals,mankind would always have food steadily available.It also meant that people could remain living in one place,and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete,like building towns,cities,and all that were in them.All the children listening were attracted by this story,until Lucy jumped up: \\"And if that was so important and improved everything so much,why are we nomads all over again,Mr.Arnold?\\" Mr.Arnold didn't know what to say.

News article: Insurers Weigh In on Health Care Law The health insurance industry is urging the Supreme Court to decide as quickly as it can whether the federal health care law is, in fact, constitutional and to consider what other parts of the law should be struck down if the individual mandate does not pass muster. America’s Health Insurance Plans, a Washington, D.C., trade group, filed its supporting brief on Tuesday about the case. The group represents the nation’s health insurance companies, many of which oppose crucial provisions of the Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Obama last year. The group argued that insurers need to know as soon as possible if the new law will be upheld. because businesses need to “make and implement numerous critical decisions now to ensure their ability to comply as requirements come into effect in the coming years.” Many of the law’s most sweeping provisions go into effect in 2014. The Obama administration says the law is constitutional and has asked the Supreme Court to hear the case quickly. Several lower courts have issued differing opinions on the law, which was challenged in court by many states. Right now, the insurers say they don’t know if the whole law will be struck down or just parts of it or whether all of the legislation will be deemed constitutional. “All of this paralyzing uncertainty—among health plans, employers, government regulators and others — underscores the vital need for a prompt and conclusive resolution of the constitutional challenge to the individual mandate. AHIP therefore respectfully urges the court to grant review of that issue and to resolve it this term,” the insurers say. The insurers also say that without the individual mandate, which would require people to buy insurance, the law is essentially unworkable. They point out that there are concerns over adverse selection, where only the people who think they need coverage buy insurance, and cite numerous examples of failed efforts by the states. “All of that evidence underscores the very real likelihood that implementation of ACA’s market reforms in the absence of the individual mandate would confound the legislation’s central goal of increasing the availability of affordable health care coverage. Congress, moreover, enacted the individual mandate in conjunction with its market reforms because it was acutely aware of the widespread difficulties that had arisen from the efforts of states to implement similar insurance market reforms without the economic counterbalance of an individual mandate,” the insurers say. Is the individual mandate constitutional? If the Supreme Court strikes it down, should the rest of the health care law be allowed to stand? Should everyone be required to have health insurance? This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the position taken by America's Health Insurance Plans on the overall federal health legislation. It is not asking the court to consider striking down the law altogether, but seeking consideration as to whether other pieces of the law should be overturned if the individual mandate is ruled unconstitutional.

Summarize this article: It was \\"planned and operated\\" from late 2011 - including the build-up to London 2012 - and continued through the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics until August 2015. An investigation commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says Russia's sports ministry \\"directed, controlled and oversaw\\" manipulation of urine samples provided by its athletes. It says Russian athletes benefited from what the report called the \\"Disappearing Positive Methodology\\", whereby positive doping samples would go missing. International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach described the commission's findings as a \\"shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games\\" and pledged to enforce the \\"toughest sanctions available\\" against those implicated. The IOC will decide on Tuesday about any \\"provisional measures and sanctions\\" for the Rio Olympics, which start on 5 August. A mind-blowing level of corruption within both Russian sport and government that goes right to the field of play The commission, led by Canadian law professor and sports lawyer Dr Richard McLaren, looked into allegations made by the former head of Russia's national anti-doping laboratory. Grigory Rodchenkov claimed he doped dozens of athletes before the 2014 Winter Olympics, which were held in Sochi, Russia. Rodchenkov - described by the Kremlin as a \\"scandalous\\" former official - also alleged he had been helped by the Russian secret service, the FSB. He claimed they had worked out how to open and reseal supposedly tamper-proof bottles that were used for storing urine samples so the contents could be replaced with \\"clean\\" urine. McLaren sent a random amount of stored samples from \\"protected Russian athletes\\" at Sochi 2014 to an anti-doping laboratory in London to see if they had scratch marks around the necks of the bottles that would indicate they had been manipulated. McLaren said \\"100% of the bottles had been scratched\\" but added that would \\"not have been visible to the untrained eye\\". He said he had \\"unwavering confidence\\" in all of his findings. The damning report does not make any recommendations, but will fuel calls for a complete ban on Russia from the 2016 Summer Olympics. Wada has recommended the IOC \\"decline entries, for Rio 2016, of all athletes\\" submitted by the Russian Olympic Committee and the Russian Paralympic Committee. Russian government officials should also be banned from this summer's Games, it said. Wada president Sir Craig Reedie called the \\"scope and scale\\" of the findings a \\"real horror story\\". President Vladimir Putin made the Sochi Games a showcase event and spent more than 50bn (£37.7bn) staging them. On Monday, Putin said officials named in the McLaren report would be suspended, pending a thorough investigation. But a statement released by the Kremlin criticised the report as \\"accusations against Russian athletes\\" based on the the testimony of \\"a person with a scandalous reputation\\". It also warned of a \\"dangerous recurrence of interference of politics in sport\\". Putin has asked Wada to provide \\"more complete, objective, evidence-based information\\" to Russian investigators. BBC sports editor Dan Roan: \\"How could all this have gone on under the noses of the IOC and Wada for years, in a Wada-accredited lab? Why did it take a whistleblower to unearth the corruption? And will this scandal split the Olympic movement beyond repair?\\" BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway: \\"It's a lot worse than people were expecting. I've read through some of the report and 580 positive tests were covered up across 30 different sports. We are into the world of James Bond-style espionage.\\" United States Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart: \\"The McLaren Report has concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, a mind-blowing level of corruption within both Russian sport and government that goes right to the field of play… and most importantly, our hearts go out to athletes from all over the world who were robbed of their Olympic dreams.\\" British Olympic 400m silver medallist Roger Black on BBC Radio 5 live: \\"It's about as bad as it could possibly be. I'm not naive, I know certain people will take drugs, but I've always said this is a minority of people. The problem now, when you're looking at a Russian athlete, is you won't be thinking that.\\" Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe on BBC Radio 5 live: \\"I think that a level of institutionalised doping, of institutionalised cheating and fraud to sport, which has done such damage to every sport globally has to be punished strongly. Unfortunately there will be some innocent athletes from Russia that will suffer from that ban.\\" British European 10,000m champion Jo Pavey on BBC Radio 5 live: \\"It's just awful. You feel sorry for any clean athletes in Russia who have put their hearts and souls into qualifying for the Olympics. At the same time, so many are in this system that a strong message needs to be sent out.\\" Lord Coe, president of the IAAF, athletics' world governing body: \\"The institutionalised and systematic doping in Russian athletics is the reason the IAAF suspended, and then upheld the suspension of, Russia Athletics Federation's membership and consequently the exclusion of their athletes from international competition.\\" UK Anti-Doping chief executive Nicole Sapstead: \\"Now is the time for the entire sporting community to come together to find a way forward and ensure the right processes, legislation and safeguards are in place to protect the rights of all athletes to clean, fair and honest competition.\\" International Paralympic Committee president Sir Philip Craven: \\"We are truly shocked, appalled and deeply saddened at the extent of the state-sponsored doping programme implemented in Russia ahead of Sochi 2014. The findings of the McLaren Report mark a very dark day for sport.\\" UK sports minister Tracey Crouch: \\"Professor McLaren's report has exposed the extreme lengths some will go to in order to cheat. This shocking report is a wake-up call to the sporting world.\\" Bill Sweeney, British Olympic Association chief, and Ben Hawes, chair of the BOA Athletes' Commission (joint statement): \\"This report realises the worst fears of clean athletes everywhere.\\" Gary Anderson, coach of the British bobsleigh team, told BBC Radio 4's PM: \\"At Sochi, we were beaten to a medal by two Russian sleds. The revelations are greater than we anticipated so there's a lot more questions to be asked.\\" The report said Russia's \\"Disappearing Positive Methodology\\" worked when analysis could be done at the Moscow laboratory. But at an international event - such as London 2012, the Athletics World Championships of 2013, or the Swimming World Championships of 2015 - Russia had to adapt its methods. The report found: It was \\"inconceivable\\" that Russia's sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, was not aware of the doping cover-up scheme, according to the report. Mutko has been in position since 2008. He is a member of the executive committee of football's world governing body, Fifa, and chairs the organising committee of the 2018 World Cup, to be held in Russia. The report claimed Mutko personally intervened to cover up a doping case of \\"at least\\" one overseas football player in the Russian league and that 11 positive tests by Russia footballers disappeared. However, it was Mutko's deputy, Yuri Nagornykh, who was advised of \\"every positive analytical finding\\" from the Moscow laboratory from 2011 onwards - in \\"total violation\\" of Wada rules - and decided who to protect. Media playback is not supported on this device The commission was set up to look into Rodchenkov's claims that he doped dozens of athletes, including at least 15 medallists, in the build-up to Sochi. He claims this was the result of an elaborate and orchestrated plot with the Russian government, which exploited its host status to subvert the drug-testing programme. The country's government has repeatedly denied the claims. Rodchenkov, now in hiding in the US, also alleges he doped athletes before the 2012 Olympics in London, the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow and the 2015 World Swimming Championships in Kazan. Yes. The country's track and field athletes are barred from competing in Rio after the body that governs world athletics, the International Association of Athletics Federations, voted in June to maintain a global competition ban on the All-Russia Athletic Federation (Araf). Araf hopes to overturn the suspension and will find out by Thursday if its appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport has been successful. Whatever happens, a small number of Russian athletes who can prove they are clean will be allowed to compete at the Rio Games under the flag of the IOC.","completion":"A report commissioned for the World Anti-Doping Agency has discovered that between 2011 and 2015, the Russian Sports Ministry directed and controlled an \\"unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and the Olympic Games.\\" Overseen by Canadian law professor, Dr Richard McLaren, the investigation discovered a massive level of corruption both in Russian sport and the government, which has since led to the International Olympic Committee to consider banning the entire Russian team from the Summer Olympics.

Pitcairn Island selects its first woman mayor in its 214-year history after its former mayor - a convicted rapist - was sacked last week.","completion":"This event is about the appointment of the first female mayor on Pitcairn Island, a significant moment in the island's 214-year history. Pitcairn Island is a small British Overseas Territory located in the South Pacific Ocean. It has a population of around 50 people, which makes it the least populous national jurisdiction in the world. The former mayor of Pitcairn, who was convicted for rape, was dismissed from his position last week. This made way for the election of the first female mayor in the island's long history, showcasing an essential development in the region's political sphere. Although the island has relatively low levels of political activity due to its small population, the appointment of a female mayor signals a critical milestone for gender equality on Pitcairn Island. The event highlights the progress towards empowering women and providing them with opportunities to lead and represent their community. Historically, like in many other parts of the world, women on Pitcairn Island have faced various kinds of discrimination, which limited their opportunities in various aspects, including politics. However, the election of the first woman mayor signifies a shift in societal attitudes and represents the growing recognition of women's rights and capabilities. Furthermore, this event sheds light on the importance of addressing issues related to sexual assault and the enforcement of the law, even in remote and small communities such as Pitcairn Island. The dismissal of the former mayor due to his criminal conviction underscores the community's commitment to upholding justice, irrespective of individuals' political standing. This historical event on Pitcairn Island exemplifies the growing global trend towards gender equality and the increased involvement of women in decision-making processes. The appointment of the first female mayor supports the broader movement advocating for equal representation for women in political leadership positions. It also brings attention to the potential impact of positive role models, particularly for young girls and women, on the island. In conclusion, the selection of the first woman mayor on Pitcairn Island is a significant development in the island's political landscape. It symbolizes the increasing recognition of women's rights, capabilities, and contributions to society, reflecting broader global trends toward gender equality. This appointment, combined with the dismissal of the former mayor due to his criminal conviction, highlights the importance of upholding the rule of law and addressing social issues such as sexual assault in all communities, regardless of their size or location. Ultimately, this event demonstrates the potential for positive change and increased representation for women in positions of power and influence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No flooding , though the water came within a foot or two of becoming dangerous . The ravine is an unplanned detention pond of sorts . More than one friend of mine has a home that filled with flood waters . Question: What might be happening that we are having severe flooding in our area ?","completion":"There could be several reasons behind the severe flooding in your area. Some of the main factors include: 1. Climate change: Rising global temperatures can result in more intense storms, heavier rainfall, and increased snowmelt, which may lead to flooding. Climate change can also cause sea levels to rise, contributing to more frequent coastal flooding. 2. Urbanization: As more land is developed with impermeable surfaces like roads, parking lots, and buildings, less water can be absorbed into the soil. This increases the amount of runoff during storms, and the stormwater drainage systems can become overloaded, leading to flooding. 3. Deforestation: The removal of trees and vegetation can reduce the land's ability to absorb and store water. In turn, this results in increased surface runoff and higher likelihood of flooding, particularly in areas with steep slopes. 4. Poor land management: Inappropriate land use practices, such as farming on steep hillsides or building homes in flood-prone areas, can contribute to flooding. Additionally, inadequate maintenance of stormwater management infrastructure, like clogged drainage systems, can also lead to flooding. 5. Changes in river systems: Natural factors, such as erosion, sedimentation, or a change in river channel geometry, can lead to increased flood risk. Human activities, like constructing dams, levees, or floodwalls, can also alter river systems and potentially exacerbate flooding if not appropriately designed and maintained. 6. Extreme weather events: Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and heavy rainfall, can cause significant flooding. These events can overwhelm drainage systems and lead to flash floods, river floods, and coastal floods. 7. Soil saturation: Prolonged periods of rainfall can cause soil to become saturated, reducing its capacity to absorb more water. When additional rain falls, it has nowhere to go, resulting in an increased risk of flooding. 8. Snowmelt and ice jams: In colder climates, rapid snowmelt or ice jams in rivers can cause a sudden release of water, leading to flooding. 9. Tidal and storm surges: Coastal areas can experience flooding due to tidal surges and storm surges during powerful storms, such as hurricanes and nor'easters. This can be exacerbated by sea-level rise resulting from climate change, as mentioned earlier. To address these issues, several measures can be implemented: 1. Implementing stricter land use regulations and zoning policies to avoid development in flood-prone areas. 2. Enhancing stormwater management systems, including upgrading drainage infrastructure and incorporating green infrastructure, like rain gardens and porous pavement. 3. Promoting reforestation and protecting existing green spaces to improve water retention. 4. Improving flood forecasting and early warning systems to protect communities from the impacts of flooding. 5. Constructing and maintaining flood defenses, like levees, dams, and floodwalls where appropriate, along with regular inspections and updates. 6.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person Thespis declines to flirt with? , can you please find it? Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth. Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis. The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them. They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth. Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence. Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter. Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need. Answer:","completion":"The name of the person Thespis declines to flirt with is Nicemis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Trigonometry\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most relevant subject when it comes to the study of triangles. In the context of the question, John has difficulty with triangles, so he would be more likely to take a class related to understanding triangles, their properties, and the relationships between their angles and sides. Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals specifically with these aspects of triangles, making it the most logical and reasonable choice among the possible answers listed. As for the other options: - A music room and music shop are unrelated to the study of triangles, as these options pertain to music and not mathematics or geometry. - Algebra is a branch of mathematics, but it is not focused on triangles and their properties.

Article: Parents have widely different views on the problem of pocket money. Four new fathers were asked this question and this is how they answered. Ashish Khanna: Although many argue that pocket money helps develop children's sense of value, I don't agree. I wouldn't give my child any pocket money. First of all, I never got pocket money and I seem to have a good value for money. If my child ever needed something and I felt it was a reasonable request, I would buy it for him. Sharad Sanghi: No, I wouldn't give my child pocket money because I don't want to create the perception of \\"her\\" money and \\"my\\" money. Besides, if I refuse to buy her something that I think is bad for her, she may buy it with her pocket money _ In this way, I would lose control over my child's requests. I feel it also encourages children to care more about money than anything else. I don't want my child to start judging other children by the amount of money or pocket money they have. Rakesh Shah: Yes, I would give my child pocket money because I feel that children should learn to spend money properly. I will give him a fixed amount every month and if he spends the money before the month is over, he will learn a lesson and not spend money so freely. He will learn what his limitations are and feel the difficulty when he has to pay for something that is over his own pocket. Rajiv Patel: Yes, I would give my child pocket money because it is important that he learns to manage money. But I would not give it to him on a weekly or monthly basis. He would have to earn it.

Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by your pineal gland located in your brain. It acts like a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, to activate certain pathways in your brain. - It forms an barrier between your brain cells and the body that's responsible for producing melatonin hormone. You'll find that getting regular periods to regulate your mood can prevent you from being able to follow a normal schedule.; - If you don't take melatonin, it can suppress the melatonin secretion. The hpv vaccine (ive) is the first dose for 30 people to develop melatonin.; - Once this phase begins, your brain reacts with melatonin and shifts up from there, producing pain and a neurotransmitter. These neurotransmitters are thought to relieve symptoms, but melatonin has drawbacks as well.; - Its role in establishing a sleep cycle has been recognized; however, recent research indicates it may be involved in other body functions as well. In the usa, melatonin is available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement and is therefore not regulated by the fda.;","completion":"Its role in establishing a sleep cycle has been recognized; however, recent research indicates it may be involved in other body functions as well.

Explanation: - The first option is wrong because melatonin does not form a barrier between brain cells and the body. It helps regulate sleep and can improve mood, but it doesn't prevent following a normal schedule. - The second option is incorrect because it mixes unrelated information about the hpv vaccine and melatonin secretion. Melatonin is a natural hormone, not related to vaccines. - The third option is not correct because it talks about brain reacting with melatonin and producing pain, which does not make sense. Melatonin is usually associated with sleep regulation and does not cause pain.

Information: - A character-oriented terminal is a type of computer terminal that communicates with its host one character at a time, as opposed to a block-oriented terminal that communicates in blocks of data. It is the most common type of data terminal, because it's easy to implement and program. Connection to the mainframe computer or terminal server is achieved via RS-232 serial links, Ethernet or other proprietary protocols. - In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called an \\"interrupt handler\\" (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal activities. There are two types of interrupts: hardware interrupts and software interrupts. - A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that is used for entering data into, and displaying data from, a computer or a computing system. Early terminals were inexpensive devices but very slow compared to punched cards or paper tape for input, but as the technology improved and video displays were introduced, terminals pushed these older forms of interaction from the industry. A related development was timesharing systems, which evolved in parallel and made up for any inefficiencies of the user's typing ability with the ability to support multiple users on the same machine, each at their own terminal. - The IBM 3270 is a class of block oriented computer terminal (sometimes called \\"display devices\\") introduced by IBM in 1971 normally used to communicate with IBM mainframes. The 3270 was the successor to the IBM 2260 display terminal. Due to the text colour on the original models, these terminals are informally known as \\"green screen\\" terminals. Unlike a character-oriented terminal, the 3270 minimizes the number of I/O interrupts required by transferring large blocks of data known as data streams, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using coaxial cable. - vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX. - IBM mainframes are large computer systems produced by IBM since 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, the term mainframe computer was almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare. Current mainframes in IBM's line of business computers are developments of the basic design of the IBM System/360. - Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced ), is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket. The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable was invented by English engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880. Coaxial cable differs from other shielded cable used for carrying lower-frequency signals, in that the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line. - The text-only monochrome IBM 2260 cathode ray tube (CRT) video display terminal (Display Station) plus keyboard was a 1964 predecessor to the more-powerful IBM 3270 terminal line which eventually was extended to support color text and graphics. - XEDIT is a visual editor for VM / CMS using block mode IBM 3270 terminals . ( Line - mode terminals are also supported . ) - In Connection-oriented communication, a data stream is a sequence of digitally encoded coherent signals (packets of data or data packets) used to transmit or receive information that is in the process of being transmitted. - Visual editors or full screen editors are editing programs which display the text being edited on the screen as it is being edited, as opposed to line-oriented editors (such as ed, ex and edlin). - Edlin is a line editor, and the only text editor provided with early versions of MS-DOS. Although superseded in MS-DOS 5.0 and later by the full-screen edit command, and by Notepad in Microsoft Windows, it continues to be included in the 32-bit versions of current Microsoft operating systems.

Republicans hope to jump-start their drive to expand the Senate majority Tuesday night by nominating challengers against Democratic senators in three states that President Donald Trump carried. But one of those primaries could instead take a deep-red state off the table for the GOP. The marquee race is in West Virginia, where Washington Republicans are hoping to deny once-imprisoned coal baron Don Blankenship the GOP nomination to face Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. President Donald Trump on Monday called on GOP primary voters to reject Blankenship and choose another candidate because Blankenship “can’t win” a general election against Manchin in November. Story Continued Below There are also primaries Tuesday in Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio — all of which are certain to define the political landscape, with incumbents facing primary challenges and another House special election brewing in Ohio, where both parties are also choosing candidates for governor. Polls close at 7 p.m. in Indiana and at 7:30 p.m. in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. Here are POLITICO’s 7 things to watch: 1. Can Republicans dodge the Blankenship bullet? The last-minute push to scuttle Blankenship’s bid — including Trump’s tweet on Monday — is a good barometer of GOP concern. While there’s been no public polling in the final two weeks of the race, internal surveys indicate Blankenship has bounced back into contention for the Republican nomination after an initial GOP barrage knocked him off his perch in April. There’s also concern that the two other major candidates — Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey — will split the anti-Blankenship vote evenly. Trump’s tweet notably did not take sides, instead urging voters to back either alternative. Blankenship’s baggage is obvious: He was convicted of violating safety standards in the Upper Big Branch mine disaster, which killed 29 miners, and was released from jail only a year ago. After his release, he settled in Nevada, not West Virginia. More recently, he’s referred to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) in television ads as “Cocaine Mitch” and made racially charged comments about McConnell’s family. Manchin has won five statewide elections in his career: one for secretary of state, two for governor, a special election for Senate and a full term two years later. Seeking reelection in a state Trump carried by a whopping 42 percentage points, Manchin could be in the fight of his political life — unless the GOP nominates the wrong candidate.

Seeking the Trump mantle in Indiana Trump hasn’t weighed in on the GOP Senate primary in Indiana, but he’s been a frequent presence on the campaign trail. Mike Braun, the favorite, is a self-funder who says Trump “paved the way” for a candidate who has spent most of his career in business, not politics. Rep. Todd Rokita has been traveling the state with a cardboard cutout of the president, and he donned a red Make America Great Again hat in a recent campaign ad. Rep. Luke Messer wants to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, based on the early negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. In recent days, Messer and Rokita have attacked Braun, citing his long history of voting in Democratic primaries. But Trump’s trajectory — the president was a long-time donor to Democratic political candidates before running as a Republican — casts doubt on whether that is still grounds for excommunication in Trump’s GOP. 3. House of pain Trump’s call to “drain the swamp” is running head-long into the ambitions of up-and-coming GOP politicians. Jenkins, Messer and Rokita enter the Tuesday primaries as underdogs and could find their political careers on ice if they fall short. Each is ambitious: Rokita, first elected in the 2010 Republican wave, has the longest tenure in the House of the three. Jenkins switched parties to challenge then-Rep. Nick Rahall (D-W.Va.) in 2014. Across the map, Republicans are counting on House members in a number of key races this fall. National Republicans believe Rep. Martha McSally is the party's best nominee for a Senate seat in Arizona, over one of her bomb-throwing conservative primary challengers. Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) is the party’s likely nominee against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) in a state Trump carried by 36 points. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) will try to keep retiring Sen. Bob Corker’s seat in GOP hands in Tennessee. One GOP House member likely to prevail on Tuesday in his bid for a nomination for higher office: Rep. Jim Renacci, who is seeking to challenge Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) this fall. Renacci has Trump’s endorsement in the primary against self-funding businessman Mike Gibbons. 4. Another wild special election in Ohio A proxy battle between former House colleagues has stirred up the special election to replace Rep. Pat Tiberi in Ohio, pitting old foes against each other in this Republican primary. Rep. Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, has lined up behind Melanie Leneghan in the Republican primary, while Tiberi is boosting state Sen. Troy Balderson. Multiple outside groups are involved on both sides, and Jordan and Tiberi appeared in dueling TV ads for their endorsed candidates. Tim Kane, a first-time candidate and veteran who’s self-funding his bid, could also win, having avoided the increasingly bitter back-and-forth between Balderson, Leneghan and their allies. But Balderson backers say that if Leneghan gets the GOP nomination, she’ll put Ohio’s 12th District — a Republican seat for decades — at risk in the Aug. 7 special election, by alienating suburban Columbus voters in a district that President Donald Trump won by 11 points in 2016. Republicans are closely watching the Democratic primary, where Franklin County Recorder Danny O’Connor led the pack in fundraising. O’Connor told POLITICO in March that he wouldn’t be supporting Nancy Pelosi’s leadership, a move that mirrors Rep. Conor Lamb’s strategy in southwestern Pennsylvania. 5. Contrasting styles in Democrats’ biggest primary The Democratic gubernatorial primary in Ohio has basically come down to two contenders: Richard Cordray, the buttoned-up former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau chief, and Dennis Kucinich, the left-leaning former congressman. Cordray has support from a broad range of “establishment” Democrats as well as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and he has talked up his time protecting Americans’ wallets at the CFPB, but Kucinich has framed himself as the only candidate who can energize grassroots progressives in the primary — and blue-collar voters in the general. A number of Bernie Sanders backers have jumped behind Kucinich, including the nonprofit group Our Revolution. Both candidates have hit each other for various progressive apostasies — Cordray’s old “A” rating from the NRA, Kucinich’s words of praise for Trump in the past — but the primary has largely been a contest about which type of populism best fits the political moment in the Democratic Party, and whether the candidates can muster sufficient enthusiasm from general election voters to give Democrats a new foothold in the heart of the Midwest this November. Cordray has more money, endorsements and support in the sparse public polling that’s been available — but Kucinich has lurked within striking distance. 6. GOP congressmen face primary challengers in North Carolina — again Republican Reps. Robert Pittenger and Walter Jones face stiff primary challenges on Tuesday, though Republicans watching the races expect both to survive. Pittenger opponent Mark Harris and Jones foe Scott Dacey have tried to question the members’ commitment to the Trump agenda — a strategy Republican primary opponents are using throughout the country. If Pittenger and Jones weather their GOP challengers, they’ll face distinctly different post-primary paths. Jones, who represents a deep red district in eastern North Carolina, would coast in the general election, and has said he won’t run for reelection in 2020. But Pittenger, unlike Jones, will go on to face a serious general election fight in the Charlotte suburbs, an area that’s trended away from Republicans in the last year. Democrat Dan McCready, a veteran and businessman, outraised both Pittenger and Harris, holding more cash on hand ahead of November. 7. What are the latest signs of Democratic enthusiasm? Democrats have been turning out at higher-than-usual rates in 2017 and 2018 so far, propelling them to victories in special elections in southwestern Pennsylvania and Alabama, as well as dozens of state legislative seats. Turnout in Tuesday’s primaries will provide yet another window into Democratic enthusiasm in a handful of House races that are expected to be competitive in November. “If you’re not seeing the increased Democratic enthusiasm and energy on their side, you’re not paying attention,” said Matt Borges, former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. “Primary turnout will give us some indication as to what that looks like here.” In particular, political operatives are watching turnout around Columbus and Cincinnati, Charlotte and Raleigh, all home to swaths of suburban voters — and potentially vulnerable Republican House incumbents. ||||| Republican voters rallied behind candidates aligned with President Trump and party leaders in a trio of pivotal Senate primaries Tuesday, reinvigorating the GOP’s bid to hold and possibly expand on its majority in midterm elections. State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey won in West Virginia, defeating Rep. Evan Jenkins and divisive candidate Don Blankenship. Wealthy businessman Mike Braun prevailed in Indiana, defeating a pair of congressmen by emulating the president with an outsider campaign. In Ohio, Rep. James B. Renacci clinched his nomination with the support of the president. In his concession speech, Blankenship blamed his loss on Trump’s decision to come out against him instead of support him. “Thanks for playing, @DonBlankenship. #WVSen,” Team Mitch, the account for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), sarcastically tweeted Tuesday night. The results capped a dramatic final week in which Trump used his Twitter bully pulpit to persuade voters not to pick Blankenship and throw away a shot at a winnable race. Republicans are defending a fragile 51-49 Senate majority, which they are increasingly framing as a last line of defense against a Democratic takeover of Congress. Trump’s unpopularity in the suburbs and exurbs where Republicans have built their House majority has led GOP leaders to conclude that the lower chamber of Congress may be all but gone in November. That has spurred them to wage an urgent campaign to hold the Senate to protect Trump and his agenda next year. But Trump’s unpredictable nature and the swirl of controversies surrounding him has made their task more difficult. Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who is campaigning for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in West Virginia, right, speaks with an attendee during a campaign event in Bluefield, W.Va. (Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News) The rise of Braun and the tone of the Republican campaigns in all three states underscored the deep animosity toward Washington that has persisted in the GOP even after Trump’s election. Braun ran in Trump’s mold, deriding the “swamp” and using his more traditional opponents as foils. Morrisey ran an ad in which a mountain smashes the U.S. Capitol. Tuesday’s vote kicked off a busy stretch of the midterm primary season, with more than two dozen additional states set to vote before July 4. In Ohio, the Democratic establishment prevailed as former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray captured the gubernatorial nomination, defeating former congressman Dennis Kucinich. In all three states and North Carolina, House primaries offered a lens into the battle for control of the lower chamber of Congress. Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) became the first sitting House member to lose in a primary this year. With almost all of the vote tallied, he trailed Mark Harris, a former Baptist pastor in Charlotte, and conceded the race. In West Virginia, a wild Senate primary with three leading candidates hurtled to its conclusion with Trump and other top Republicans trying to stop Blankenship, a former coal executive who has served a year in prison and has used racial epithets to describe black people and those of Chinese descent. View Graphic Another House Republican falls short in a bid for higher office With more than 90 percent of the vote tallied, Morissey led Jenkins 35 percent to 29 percent. Blankenship was a distant third at 20 percent. Another three-way contest wrapped up in Indiana, where Braun, a distributing and logistics executive, loaned his campaign more than 5 million of his own money en route to defeating Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita. Braun sought to draw a sharp contrast with Rokita and Messer. In one ad, he erected cardboard cutouts of his opponents, both pictured wearing dark suits and red ties. In the ad, he asked people to try to tell them apart. West Virginia and Indiana represent two of the Republican Party’s best chances to bolster its Senate majority in November. They are part of a GOP firewall of 10 states Trump won and a Democratic senator is defending. Fears about nominating a candidate outside the mainstream escalated in recent weeks, particularly in West Virginia. Republican leaders had worried that a win by Blankenship would cost them a plum shot at defeating Sen. Joe Manchin III (D). Trump won West Virginia by about 42 percentage points in 2016. They were also concerned that the controversies surrounding Blankenship might spread to other key battlegrounds, dragging down Republican candidates across the country. It has caused painful memories of Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican who lost a long-held Republican seat last year after The Washington Post reported that he made unwanted sexual advances to teenage girls when he was in his 30s. In the West Virginia Senate race, Republican leaders spent weeks warning that voting for Blankenship would be the wrong choice for a simple reason: He would be a weak candidate in the general election. They were hopeful that enough voters like Tom Vogel of Charleston would show up Tuesday. Vogel said he voted for Morrisey. “Don Blankenship is just not going to win in November. And Morrisey is the better man anyway. He has the conservative views that I have,” Vogel said. Mitchell Eggleston of Charleston said he voted for Jenkins — as a means of stopping Blankenship. “I just can’t vote for Don Blankenship. There is no doubt that he was responsible for that mine accident. I don’t get into the details of politics, but I just think that he should not be involved in the state at all,” he said. Robert Ehman of Charleston, W.Va., who voted for Blankenship, called him an “honest man” and brushed aside his imprisonment for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations after an explosion at one of his company’s mines killed 29 people in 2010. “I think we need someone like him that’s a fresh face,” Ehman said. Blankenship aggressively attacked McConnell in his campaign. He labeled him “Cocaine Mitch” in ads, referring to a drug bust on a ship owned by the company his father-in-law started. He has called McConnell’s­ ­father-in-law, who was born in China, a “wealthy China person” and called out his “China family.” McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, is the secretary of transportation. She immigrated to the United States from Taiwan as a child. Blankenship defended his language to a Roll Call reporter, saying, “We’re confused on our staff as to how it can be racist when there’s no mention of a race. There’s no race. Races are negro, white caucasian, Hispanic, Asian.” He also faced an onslaught from mainstream Republicans. An organization called Mountain Families PAC that has ties to McConnell allies ran advertisements criticizing Blankenship, highlighting how badly GOP leaders wanted to defeat him. Trump took to Twitter on Monday after McConnell encouraged him to speak out, urging voters not to pick Blankenship and reminding them of the Alabama debacle. Braun will take on Sen. Joe Donnelly, a centrist Democrat who has been long been a top target of Republican strategists. Trump won Indiana by 19 points. In the Ohio governor’s race, Cordray will face state Attorney General Mike DeWine, who defeated Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor for the Republican nomination. Gov. John Kasich (R), whose moderate views have put him at odds with many in his party, is term-limited. Party strategists were watching a handful of House primaries Tuesday, including a competition for an open seat outside Columbus that triggered a showdown between moderate and conservative Republicans. Renacci, who was the front-runner for the Republican nomination headed into Tuesday’s vote, will face Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Vice President Pence’s older brother Greg Pence, meanwhile, won the Republican nomination in Indiana’s 6th District. Afi Scruggs in Cleveland, Daniel Heyman in Charleston, W.Va., and David Weigel, Michael Scherer and Mike DeBonis in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Midterm Republican primaries have shown support for candidates aligned with President Trump and party leaders in critical Senate elections, indicating a revitalization in efforts to build the GOP's majority.

Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.

Lindsey was much stronger than Megan since Select from: -Lindsey was a gym rat who worked out at least five days a week. -Megan was a gym rat who worked out at least five days a week.","completion":"Lindsey was much stronger than Megan since Lindsey was a gym rat who worked out at least five days a week. While both Lindsey and Megan were dedicated to their fitness routines, Lindsey's commitment to consistently pushing her limits in the gym and focusing on strength-building exercises had given her an undeniable advantage in terms of physical prowess. Not only did Lindsey prioritize weightlifting, incorporating various functional movements targeting different muscle groups, but she also followed a meticulously planned workout program that maximized muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. From heavy compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses to isolation exercises targeting smaller muscles, Lindsey made sure her workouts were well-rounded and comprehensive. This allowed her to excel in comparison to her peers, including Megan. On the other hand, Megan, while also a frequent gym-goer, had a different focus in her workouts. She spent more time on cardiovascular endurance and flexibility exercises, which contributed to her overall fitness but did not necessarily result in the same level of strength that Lindsey had achieved. Megan's typical workout routine involved a mix of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), steady-state cardio, and yoga – all of which were fantastic for her general well-being, but simply did not yield the same raw power that Lindsey had cultivated. Moreover, Lindsey made a point of adhering to proper nutrition and supplementing her diet to support her strength training regimen. This included consuming an optimal balance of macronutrients like protein, carbohydrates, and fats, as well as monitoring her micronutrient intake to ensure that her body was receiving all the essential vitamins and minerals necessary for growth and recovery. By contrast, Megan maintained a healthy but slightly less structured diet that, while beneficial for her overall health, did not give her the same edge in the strength department. Outside of the gym, Lindsey also took advantage of various recovery techniques to further enhance her strength gains. These included practices like foam rolling, massage, and proper sleep, in addition to staying hydrated and managing stress levels. Megan, while conscious of these factors to some degree, did not place as much emphasis on them, which may have contributed to the difference in their strength capabilities. In summary, Lindsey was much stronger than Megan due to her unwavering commitment to rigorous and purposeful strength training, a well-planned and nutrient-dense diet, and a focus on optimizing recovery. Despite sharing a love for fitness, the marked contrast between the two women's workout routines, goals, and priorities ultimately put Lindsey at the forefront when it came to sheer physical strength."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios? ? The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

Generate a question about the following movie plot: On the Eastern front during World War II, the Soviet army is fighting the invading German Wehrmacht. The film features a non-linear plot with frequent flashbacks. After a brief dream sequence, Ivan Bondarev, a 12-year-old Russian boy, wakes up and crosses a war-torn landscape to a swamp, then swims across a river. On the other side, he is seized by Russian soldiers and brought to the young Lieutenant Galtsev, who interrogates him. The boy insists that he call \\"Number 51 at Headquarters\\" and report his presence. Galtsev is reluctant, but when he eventually makes the call, he is told by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov to give the boy pencil and paper to make his report, which will be given the highest priority, and to treat him well. Through a series of dream sequences and conversations between different characters, it is revealed that Ivanâs mother and sister (and probably his father, a border guard) have been killed by German soldiers. He got away and joined a group of partisans. When the group was surrounded, they put him on a plane. After the escape, he was sent to a boarding school, but he ran away and joined an army unit under the command of Gryaznov. Burning for revenge, Ivan insists on fighting on the front line. Taking advantage of his small size, he is successful on reconnaissance missions. Gryaznov and the other soldiers grow fond of him and want to send him to a military school. They give up their idea when Ivan tries to run away and rejoin the partisans. He is determined to avenge the death of his family and others, such as those killed at the Maly Trostenets extermination camp (which he mentions that he has seen). A subplot involves Captain Kholin and his aggressive advances towards a pretty army nurse, Masha, and Galtsev's own undeclared and unrequited feelings for her. Much of the film is set in a room where the officers await orders and talk, while Ivan awaits his next mission. On the walls are scratched the last messages of doomed prisoners of the Germans.

A:","completion":"Given the list of answer choices and the context provided, the best answer would be \\"volume.\\" When using a measuring cup for sugar, you are measuring its volume. A measuring cup is a common kitchen utensil designed to measure the amount, or volume, of various ingredients required for a recipe. Using a measuring cup ensures that the correct amount of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, is added to the recipe. This is important for achieving the right taste, texture, and overall quality of the final product. Sugar, being an organic substance, is available in various forms, depending on the level of crystallization and processing. For instance, granulated sugar typically consists of small, regular-shaped crystalline particles, while powdered, or confectioners', sugar features even smaller and more finely ground crystals. Despite these differences, a measuring cup can still accurately measure the volume needed for each type of sugar. It is important to note that measuring volume differs from measuring other characteristics of a substance like decibels (a unit of sound intensity), density (mass per unit volume), length, and height. In the context of the question, these other answer choices are not applicable. Additionally, a kernel refers to an individual seed or grain, Joules is a unit of energy, and liquid references a fluid substance that doesn't have a fixed shape but rather takes the shape of its container.

Article: There are a variety of reasons why you need tooth extraction surgery. Some of them include: Teeth are blocking others from coming in. Baby teeth have not fallen out to give space for permanent teeth. Tooth has decayed past the point of salvaging. A decayed tooth presents a risk of infection to the rest of the mouth. A need to create space before an orthodontic treatment. If you are getting your adult teeth pulled, they will not grow back. Your oral surgeon should explain to you why tooth extraction is the best and only way to treat your problem. They will need to know all the vitamins, prescriptions, and over-the-counter medications you may be taking. These medications could impact the type of anesthetic they use when prepping you for surgery. Let your doctor know about any allergies or general health issues you may have, in particular any problems relating to your heart or blood. Local anesthetics can sometimes cause reactions with certain medicines. Your oral surgeon should get local x-rays of the area where they will be operating. This provides them with the best plan to extract your tooth. If you’re having your wisdom teeth taken out, the oral surgeon will take a panoramic x-ray, which takes a picture of all of your teeth. This is especially important if the wisdom teeth are impacted and may require delicate work around the jaw. Depending on the severity of your tooth extraction, you may be pretty out of it when you come to consciousness. This will severely impair your ability to drive, so it’s important to have transportation arranged beforehand. You may be able to get a friend or family member to drive you. If possible, find someone who can stay with you after the surgery. Getting a ride with a taxi or ride service is probably not the best option. You will likely need to fast the night before surgery. This reduces the risk of inhaling the contents of the stomach into the lungs while you’re out. The standard amount of time to fast before surgery is eight to 12 hours, but your doctor should let you know how long is necessary. At the very least, you should not drink or eat anything after midnight. If you are diabetic or take any prescribed medicines, follow your normal routine. Verify this with your oral surgeon before doing so. You may be prescribed antibiotics if you have a weakened immune system or if you have an infection when it’s time for surgery. If you have any illness up to a week prior to the surgery, tell your oral surgeon. They may want to reschedule your appointment until you are better. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: Tooth extraction surgery may be necessary for various reasons, such as overcrowding, decay, or orthodontic treatment. Prior to surgery, the patient should inform the oral surgeon of any medications, allergies, and health issues. X-rays will be taken to plan the extraction, and the patient should arrange for transportation and possible post-surgery care. Fasting before the surgery is usually required, while diabetics or those on prescribed medicines should follow their normal routine and consult their surgeon. Antibiotics may be prescribed for those with weakened immune systems or infections.

Whether you are dressing for a business meeting, casual outing, formal event, or hitting the gym, here are some ways you can incorporate maroon pants into your wardrobe repertoire. Step One: Understanding the Types of Maroon Pants First, let us explore the different cuts of maroon pants available to help you select the perfect pair for your desired look. 1. Trouser-cut maroon pants: These pants are designed with a wider leg opening and are typically made of a more structured material, such as a thick woven fabric. They are an ideal choice for a business look when paired with a blazer or button-down shirt. Adding a muted color palette for your top and accessories will keep the focus on these trousers and ensure that you look professional and polished. 2. Maroon skinny jeans: If you are looking for a more casual look, maroon skinny jeans are the way to go. They offer a snug fit and usually come in stretch denim for added comfort. Maroon skinny jeans can be easily paired with a simple t-shirt or sweater, ankle boots or sneakers, making them a go-to option for a casual day out or relaxed evening. 3. Straight-cut maroon pants: The straight-cut maroon pants provide a timeless, polished look. They are typically fitted around the waist and thighs but gradually loosen towards the ankles. Pair them with ballet flats or low heels and a blouse or knit top for a sophisticated outfit, perfect for a dinner party or formal gathering. 4. Maroon leggings: As athleisure wear continues to gain popularity, do not neglect the opportunity to incorporate maroon leggings into your wardrobe. These versatile pants provide both style and comfort, making them perfect for a rigorous workout or a casual stroll around town. Pair them with your favorite sports bra or workout top and sneakers for an energetic look that can easily transition to a casual coffee date. Step Two: Accessorizing Your Maroon Pants To further elevate your maroon pants, consider adding the right accessories. For a business look, a statement belt can add a touch of flair to your trouser-cut maroon pants, while a classic watch or minimalist jewelry will keep the ensemble professional. For casual or athleisure outfits, try a colorful scarf, bold earrings, or a chic crossbody bag to add some contrasting color.

By carefully selecting the right pair for your desired look, and adding appropriate accessories, you will have a flawless outfit for any occasion.

Although they can survive in very small, cramped tanks, it’s healthier for the fish to give it a larger environment. Look for a tank that is holds around five gallons of water, as this will give the fish plenty of space. Do not keep your betta in a tank smaller than one gallon. Since betta fish breathe air directly from the top of the water, your tank does not need a filtration system. In fact, it’s better if the tank doesn’t have one—the current created by the filtration is stressful to bettas. . Wash the fish tank thoroughly and then rinse the gravel carefully in hot tap water. Do not use soap or detergent on the gravel. Then layer the gravel carefully at the bottom of the tank. Rinse any decorations and put them into the tank. The tank does not necessarily have to be a traditional fish tank; any large container will do. It’s important that you include gravel in the fish tank. Opt for a neutral color, and for relatively small-grained gravel. The neutral color will calm your betta, and bacteria that build up on the gravel will digest your fish’s waste and keep the water relatively clean. Do not use mineral water in the tank, since it lacks important minerals that your betta fish will need. It’s important that, when filled with tap water, your fish tank will have plenty of surface area at the top. Betta fish do breathe underwater like most fish, but come up to the surface for an extra gulp of air at times. For this reason, a narrow-topped container like a wine bottle does not make a suitable tank for a betta. A conditioner will remove chlorine (which is unhealthy for fish) from your tap water, and also filter out other impurities and heavy metals. Follow the instructions on the conditioner bottle, and remember to add this as you fill the tank with water. You’ll also need to add conditioner every time you change the water in the fish tank (roughly once a week). If you bought your betta at a pet store, you should have received a water conditioner specifically made for bettas. If you were not given one, you’ll need to purchase a conditioner on your own. Conditioners should be available at any pet store, and can also be easily purchased online. The amount of conditioner that you use will vary based on the size of your fish tank. Follow the directions on the bottle regarding the amount of conditioner to use, and the amount of time to let it mix in the water before it’s safe for your fish. If you live in a rural area where the tap water is not chlorinated, you may not need to use a conditioner. Some conditioners get rid of heavy metals though, so you can use it if you need.

It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided refers to the Socialist Party (SP) in the Netherlands and two of its prominent leaders, Emile Roemer and Agnes Kant. The Socialist Party is a Dutch political organization with a left-wing and socialist ideology. The party primarily focuses on issues related to social justice, income equality, and the welfare state. It opposes privatization, deregulation, and other neoliberal policies. The SP is represented in various levels of government in the Netherlands, including the national parliament, municipal councils, and provincial legislatures. Emile Roemer is a Dutch politician who served as the leader of the Socialist Party from 2010 to 2017. Born on August 24, 1962, in Boxmeer, Roemer began his career as a teacher before entering the world of politics. He was a member of the municipal council of Boxmeer from 1994 to 2002, and a member of the Provincial States of North Brabant from 1999 to 2006. In 2006, he was elected to the Dutch House of Representatives and served there until 2017. During his tenure as the leader of the SP, Emile Roemer aimed to broaden the party's appeal while remaining committed to its core values and principles. Although the party did not make significant electoral gains during his leadership, Roemer was praised for his dedication to social justice and his empathic approach to politics. Agnes Kant, born on January 20, 1967, in Hengelo, is another notable Dutch politician and a former leader of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands. She served as a Member of Parliament from 1998 to 2010 and as the chair of the SP parliamentary group from 2008 to 2010. Kant earned a degree in health sciences and, prior to her political career, she worked as a researcher at Radboud University in Nijmegen. Agnes Kant's tenure as leader of the SP was brief, spanning from 2008 to 2010, following Jan Marijnissen's resignation due to health issues. Though her leadership did not last long, Kant's strong focus on social and healthcare policies contributed to shaping the party's overall stance on these issues. In summary, the provided data highlights the Socialist Party of the Netherlands and its connection to two significant party leaders, Emile Roemer and Agnes Kant. Both leaders played important roles in shaping the party's ideology and vision, with an emphasis on social justice, income equality, and the welfare state. While their tenures as party leaders yielded varying levels of success, both Roemer and Kant's contributions to the Socialist Party have been integral to its continued presence in the Dutch political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Still Crazy Movie plot: \\"History teaches us that men behave wisely . . . once they've exhausted all other alternatives. For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate.

When different types of tissues work together to perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ systems. Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. The shoot system consists of two portions: the vegetative (nonreproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and the stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include flowers and fruits. The shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis. The root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground.

Sissi cares for her patients to the effect that they appear to be her extended family (in fact, she states that her own father is a patient in the hospital). As such, she has little experience of life outside the hospital. Meanwhile, Bodo, living with his brother, applies for a funerary job but is quickly dismissed because of his inability to control his emotions. He later robs a grocery store and during the ensuing chase indirectly causes a truck to hit Sissi. Taking cover from the police underneath the truck, Bodo finds Sissi, who cannot speak or breathe. In order to save her life, he performs an emergency tracheotomy. Once Sissi is in medical care, they are separated without Sissi ever learning his name. The circumstances of her accident prevent Sissi from re-adjusting to her mundane life at the hospital, as she obsesses about tracking down her saviour. One of her patient friends, who had accompanied her on the day of her accident, helps her do so. She manages to track down Bodo, who is not interested in maintaining contact with her or any other woman.

Premise: \\"LSC initially stressed the importance of state plan\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"LSC first came out explaining the state plan is very important. \\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"LSC initially stressed the importance of state plan\\" is true, it provides valuable information regarding the hypothesis \\"LSC first came out explaining the state plan is very important.\\" We can proceed to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis in greater depth. The premise asserts that, from the beginning, LSC placed emphasis on the significance of the state plan. This could involve outlining the key components of the state plan, stressing its relevance to achieving specific goals, and advocating for its implementation or adoption. In other words, LSC made it clear since the initial stages that the state plan was an important element of its overall strategy or approach. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that \\"LSC first came out explaining the state plan is very important.\\" This implies that, when LSC was just being introduced or presented to the public, it was already advocating for the importance of the state plan. The hypothesis suggests that the primary message delivered by LSC at its inception was centered around the significance of the state plan. By comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe that both statements focus on the notion that LSC prioritized the importance of the state plan from the outset. The key difference between the two is that the premise merely asserts this fact, while the hypothesis adds the context of LSC's public introduction. Consequently, if the premise is indeed true, it provides substantial support for the overall validity of the hypothesis. In conclusion, if we accept the premise \\"LSC initially stressed the importance of state plan\\" as true, it strongly suggests that the hypothesis \\"LSC first came out explaining the state plan is very important\\" is also likely to be true. Both statements convey a similar message, emphasizing that LSC identified the state plan as a critical component of its approach right from the beginning. Although the hypothesis provides additional context, it is not contradictory to the premise, and, in fact, the premise lends credence to the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We don't want to accidentally get rid of something important, do we? So, make sure to get their permission before you start cleaning. 2. Team Up with Your Brothers, Sisters, and Cousins Cleaning is much more fun when we do it with our best friends –- our family! Ask your brothers, sisters, cousins, or anyone else in your family to help. Together, you can make the house sparkling clean in no time! 3. Use a Big Trash Container Sometimes, we find lots of things to throw away when we clean. Ask your parents to call a dumpster service to bring a big trash container to your house. This way, you'll have a place to put all the clutter you find. 4. Clean One Room at a Time When we start cleaning, it's important to focus on one room first. This will make the task less overwhelming. Pick a room to clean (like the living room or your bedroom) and finish it before you move on to the next one. 5. Sort Your Stuff As you clean, you'll find all sorts of things: toys, clothes, books, and more. To make things easier, put them in different piles. For example, make one pile for toys that you want to keep and another for toys that you want to give away. This will make it easier for Mommy and Daddy to know what to do with your things. 6. Make It a Fun Cleaning Day Cleaning can be tiring, but it doesn't have to be boring! Try to get as much done in one day as possible by making it a fun experience. Play some music, sing songs, or make up cleaning games. The more fun you have, the quicker the time will fly by, and before you know it, your house will be super clean! So, are you ready to be a little helper and make your house shine? Just remember these tips and ask your family to join the cleaning adventure. Together, you'll make your home neat, tidy, and ready for more fun times ahead. Happy cleaning!"},{"prompt":"Aplant requires food for survival, and life is no longer merely survival, but growth and thriving.

I never really thought anything of it as instructors would often pull guys aside for reviews, specific instructions or taskings. I don’t know how much time passed but the candidate walked back in.

We asked if everything was alright, and he told us that the day prior, the The candidate’s wife had gone into labor however there were complications with the baby but the complications were unknown. He was reporting to the commander to let him know whether he wanted to stay in training or leave because the military does not consider a spouse’s pregnancy to be an emergency even though the complication should be. If he were to leave he would have to drop from the TACP pipeline with a possibility of either starting it over from the beginning of quitting all together.

Identify the topic in the question: The main topic here is the first law specifically intended for special education. 2. Perform a research: To determine when this law was passed, I'll look for reliable sources such as official government websites, reputable online encyclopedias, and educational resources. 3. Analyze and synthesize the information: After gathering the relevant information, I'll analyze and synthesize it to provide a concise and accurate answer to the question. After completing these steps, I found out that the first law directly intended for special education was the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, specifically Title VI, which focused on providing grants to states for the education of children with disabilities. However, the more comprehensive law that had a significant impact on special education was the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA), now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which was passed in 1975. The IDEA established the rights and regulations for providing children with disabilities a free and appropriate public education tailored to their individual needs. In conclusion, the first law directly intended for special education was the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, with Title VI focusing on disability grants for the education of children with disabilities, while the comprehensive Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) was passed in 1975, ensuring a free and appropriate public education for children with disabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Charged: Charles Wilkinson, pictured, 69, a retired police officer, killed his wife, 65-year-old Kathleen Wilkinson, inside their upstate New York home last week, authorities said Monday. A 69-year-old retired police officer killed his wife inside their upstate New York home last week, then spent several days with the body, authorities said Monday. A sheriff's deputy looking into the welfare of 65-year-old Kathleen Wilkinson found her body Sunday on a bedroom floor in her home in Malta, 20 miles north of Albany, Saratoga County District Attorney James Murphy III said. She was choked during a domestic dispute last week with her husband of 46 years, Charles Wilkinson, a retired officer in Long Island's Nassau County, a felony complaint states. The man spent the weekend in the house with the body before letting the deputy in after police received calls from her acquaintances saying they hadn't heard from her for several days, the prosecutor said. Friends of the woman had gone to the home, but Charles Wilkinson wouldn't let them in, Murphy said. Further details on the time and cause of death won't be determined until after an autopsy is conducted Monday afternoon, he said. However, a felony complaint filed with the town court and seen by the Daily Gazette indicates Wilkinson choked his wife to death at about 10 p.m. Friday. Sheriff's deputies were called to the house for a welfare check by the couple's adult son who lives ion the Boston area. 'The responding deputy was greeted at the door by Charles Wilkinson. After a period of discussion at the door Charles Wilkinson allowed the deputy to enter the residence at which time the deputy located the body of Kathleen Wilkinson deceased on the floor of a first-floor bedroom,' the sheriff's statement continued. They could see no obvious cause of death. Scene: Wilkinson spent the weekend in the house, pictured, with the body before letting the deputy in after police received calls from her acquaintances saying they hadn't heard from her for several days, prosecutors said. Wilkinson was charged with second-degree murder and was being held in the county jail without bail. Murphy said he didn't know whether Wilkinson had a lawyer. Authorities have yet to determine a motive for the slaying, despite lengthy interviews with Wilkinson. Wilkinson retired after 13 years with the Nassau County Police Department in 1984. He then worked as a painter and most recently as a part-time security guard at the nearby GlobalFoundries computer chip plant. The couple had lived in Malta for about 10 years and have two adult children who live in the Boston area, Murphy said. Kathleen Wilkinson worked as a teachers' aide on Long Island, but hadn't worked since the couple moved to Malta. The slaying occurred in a tidy suburban development a few miles south of Saratoga Springs. Neighbors spoke highly of the couple and said they weren't aware of any domestic issues, Murphy said. There was also no history of prior domestic violence calls to police from the home. 'We're very lucky to have very few murders,' he said. 'Certainly it's very disturbing to have it happen in a very quiet neighborhood.' Wilkinson is being held Saratoga County Jail in lieu of bail. Second degree murder carries a potential sentence of 25 years to life in prison. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten.

They are not biologically pre-programmed, but rather acquired over time as an individual interacts with their environment. The example given of teaching a dog to sit on command is a classic illustration of a learned behavior, as the dog is not innately aware of the need to sit when hearing the command and must learn the desired response through practice and reinforcement.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. answer the following question: What are the two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle?

King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church on a Sunday morning and killed four young girls. FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans. Rowe was involved, along with the Birmingham Police, with the KKK attacks on the Freedom Riders, led by Fred Shuttlesworth, in Anniston, Alabama on May 14, 1961.

All its life it had been asleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday morning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt Patsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people; Saturday morning, emergence as practicing lawyer of the long-submerged Pudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled stranger. The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together, perhaps. It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there.

Today, we will talk about an important topic. The NHS, or National Health Service, is a big, important thing in England. It's like a group of super heroes who help people when they are sick or hurt. But sometimes, the government – that's the group of people who make big decisions for the country – treats the NHS like it's a sad, failing business or a bank. And that's not good. An important journal, filled with really smart people who write about important things, said that the government should stop doing that. Now, let's talk about why treating the NHS differently is important. 1. No Money? No Problem! When we talk about a business or a bank, making money is a big thing, right? But the NHS is about helping people. So, if the government treats the NHS like a business, they might forget that it's not always about money. 2. Saving the Superheroes! This group of health superheroes is amazing, isn't it? They work very hard to keep everyone healthy and happy. But if the government treats the NHS like a sad business, our heroes might not get enough support to keep on being super. 3. Keeping People Happy and Healthy The most important thing about the NHS is making sure everyone can see a doctor or nurse when they need to. The government should remember that and treat the NHS in a way that helps everyone have access to good healthcare. In conclusion, the government should treat the NHS like the special, helpful thing it is – not like a failing business or bank. By doing this, they will be helping everyone in England to stay healthy and happy! Keep cheering for our NHS superheroes, kids!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This was the first sushi restaurant I have visited in years, and the very first one I've visited in Arizona. The friend I went with said it was the best sushi restaurant in the east valley (some poll or other said so), thus we decided to take a stab at it. And, to be honest, I mainly wanted to taste miso soup again (one of my favorite soups on the planet). We walked in and it looked like any typical asian restaurant. To one side was a long bar, where you can sit and eat, or sit and drink saki or beer. To the other side was a long row of booths. We decided to booth it up. We sat down and shrugged... seemed fine so far. The decor looked a little cheap, but the more hole-in-the-wall a place is, the more likely I will like it. So, we both order a Japanese beer, take out the sushi list, and just go to town. We order just about one of everything, including bowls of miso soup. I was surprised that the sushi came out one at a time. We'd dig into one, and once we were almost done and forming our opinions about it, another one would come out. That was kinda fun. Every kind we decided to get was exquisite, and reminded me of my favorite sushi joint in Minneapolis, Kikugawa (and believe you me - I've tried EVERY sushi restaurant in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metro area). Not only was the sushi tasty but it was *beautiful*. They must have really talented sushi chefs working for them, because it was wonderful. This was also the first time I got \\"deep fried\\" sushi. If you haven't tried it... DO IT! We got a deep fried roll that had crab, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, and rice... wow. Mind blown (can you tell I really love certain things??). If I can find other friends who would like to go out to a sushi restaurant in the east valley, this restaurant will definitely be revisited by me! (Plus, surprise, they gave us free dessert! Yay watermelon!) Is this review positive or negative? Options are: * negative. * positive. Answer:","completion":"* positive. This review is positive because the person enjoyed their experience at the sushi restaurant. They liked the sushi, found it beautiful and tasty, and even got a free dessert.

If you are destined to dine at Westgate I recommend the sushi joint or Yard House. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment? Select from: --negative. --positive.","completion":"The review provided can be described as predominantly negative in terms of sentiment for several reasons. Firstly, the review mentions that the \\"cute waitresses\\" are the only positive or attractive aspect of the bar, which implies that there may not be much else to offer in terms of the overall experience. While this comment might be perceived as slightly positive, the term \\"cute\\" may not directly imply the quality of service provided or the overall customer satisfaction, but rather focus solely on the appearance of the waitresses. Secondly, the reviewer states that \\"the food is sub par bar fare.\\" The adjective \\"sub par\\" denotes that the food is below average, suggesting a lack of satisfaction or disappointment in the quality of the dishes offered. This negative remark is followed by a similar observation regarding the drinks - they are described as \\"always weak,\\" implying dissatisfaction with the potency or flavor of the beverages. Lastly, the reviewer concludes by recommending alternative dining options within the same location (Westgate). By suggesting that customers consider eating at the sushi joint or Yard House instead, the reviewer implies these establishments may offer a better overall experience than the discussed bar. Recommending alternative venues reinforces the negative sentiment of the review because it further indicates that the bar does not meet the expectations or needs of its customers. In conclusion, the review can be characterized as negative due to its critical assessment of the food, drinks, and overall experience at the bar, coupled with the recommendation to visit other establishments instead. Although there is a mention of a potentially positive aspect (the appearance of the waitresses), it does not outweigh the numerous negative points made throughout the review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He had picked out the perfect spot, right above the fireplace, and had even invited a few friends over to help with the installation. But as they unpacked the TV from its box, Tim realized that the TV was much smaller than he had anticipated. Disappointed, Tim scratched his head, wondering what to do. The TV would look ridiculous mounted on the wall due to its size, and the mounting kit he had purchased wouldn't even hold the smaller TV securely. After a moment, his friend Alice suggested that they search for a solution online. The group agreed, and they began to research alternative mounting options for small TVs. They discovered that there were adjustable TV wall mounts, designed to hold TVs of various sizes. These mounts could easily support Tim's smaller flat screen, and would allow it to be mounted securely without looking out of place. Feeling hopeful, Tim and his friends decided to visit a nearby electronics store to see if they could find one of these adjustable mounts. At the store, they found a wide selection of TV mounting options. Tim was initially overwhelmed by the choices, but Alice reminded him to look for an adjustable mount that could hold TVs of different sizes. They found a few models that seemed suitable, and after reading the descriptions and comparing the prices, they settled on one that suited Tim's needs and budget. With the adjustable mount in hand, they returned to Tim's house. They carefully followed the instruction manual, customizing the mount to fit Tim's smaller TV. After some trial and error, they finally managed to securely fasten the TV on the wall, above the fireplace. To their delight, it looked perfect, despite its size. Feeling proud of their accomplishment, Tim and his friends decided to test out the new setup by having a movie night. They browsed through Netflix, searching for a film that they could all enjoy. After some debate, they agreed on an action-packed thriller with impressive visual effects, which would work perfectly for testing the newly-mounted TV. As the movie played, Tim couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Although the TV was smaller than he had initially wanted, the new wall mount had made it look just right in its spot above the fireplace. The adjustable mount had saved the day, and Tim realized that sometimes, solutions can be found even when things don't initially turn out as planned. The movie night was a success, and Tim's friends congratulated him on creating a cozy and stylish viewing area. They all agreed to make it a regular event, and Tim found himself looking forward to many more nights spent enjoying his newly-mounted TV with his friends. The smaller screen size no longer mattered — they had made it work, and it had become the perfect focal point for his living room."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: زیست‌کُره یا بیوسفر به آن بخش یا لایه از کره زمین گفته می‌شود که در آن زندگی وجود دارد. این لایه زیستگاه انسان و دیگر موجودات زنده همچون پرندگان، ماهیان یا سازواره‌ها و موجودات خاکزی است و تا لایه‌های زیرین از زمین که ریشه درختان و دیگر جانداران نفوذ می‌کند، ادامه دارد. در زمین‌های سخت، زیست‌کره تنها تا عمق چند متری ادامه دارد (به استثناء باکتری‌ها که در لایه‌های ژرف‌تری نیز حضور دارند.) در هوا زیست‌کره تا حدود ۸ کیلومتر یعنی تا جایی که اکسیژن یافت می‌شود، حضور دارد و در دریاها تا ژرفاهای بسیار و حتی تا ۱۱ کیلومتر در زیر اقیانوس (در درازگودال‌ها) نیز ادامه دارد. زیست‌کره یا همان زیستگاه موجودات زنده در لایه‌های آب‌کره، جو و سنگ‌کره قرار دارد. دانشمندان بر این باورند که زیست‌کره در پی یک فرایند زیست‌زایی که حدود ۳٫۵ میلیارد سال پیش آغاز شد، شکل گرفته و تکامل یافته‌است. کره زمین ۷۰ درصد از نور خورشید را جذب می‌کند. یک درصد از این نور از سوی گیاهان و جلبک‌ها طی فرایند نورساخت جذب می‌شوند. ۳۰ درصد بقیه نور خورشید به فضا بازمی‌تابد. زیست‌کره بدون این نور که از خورشید می‌رسد، از میان خواهد رفت.

(CNN) -- A German citizen of Afghan descent was the source of much of the information on a potential \\"Mumbai-style\\" terror plot in Europe, a German counterterrorism official said Wednesday. The man, Ahmed Sidiqi, was detained in Kabul in July and transferred to U.S. custody where he has \\"revealed details about the terror plot,\\" said the official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media. The man and several other Germans traveled from Hamburg to the Afghan-Pakistan border area in 2009, where he joined the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an extremist group allied with al Qaeda, German intelligence officials said. The German government is increasingly concerned about the number of","completion":"its citizens who are becoming radicalized and joining extremist groups abroad, posing a significant threat to national security. The number of individuals traveling to conflict zones like Afghanistan and Pakistan has risen in recent years, prompting authorities to intensify their efforts in monitoring and combating such activities. According to German intelligence agencies, many of these individuals are being recruited through social media and online forums, as well as in radical mosques and religious centers across the country. It is believed that they are often lured by the promise of a sense of belonging, purpose, and the opportunity to fight for a cause they believe in. As a response to this growing concern, the German government has implemented several prevention and deradicalization programs to target those who may be at risk of radicalization. One such program, dubbed \\"EXIT Germany,\\" focuses on providing support, assistance, and counseling to individuals who wish to leave extremist groups and reintegrate into society. Other initiatives include increased surveillance of online activities, working closely with religious leaders and communities, and strengthening international partnerships to share intelligence and resources in the fight against terrorism. Despite these efforts, the challenge of addressing radicalization remains an ongoing struggle, not just for Germany but for many countries across the globe. As violent extremism continues to evolve and adapt, so too must the strategies and tactics employed by governments and security agencies to identify, intercept, and neutralize potential threats. In the case of Ahmed Sidiqi, his arrest and subsequent cooperation with authorities have provided valuable intelligence on the planned \\"Mumbai-style\\" terror plot in Europe, potentially saving countless lives and thwarting the plans of extremist groups. However, as the number of radicalized individuals continues to grow, the challenge of preventing further attacks remains ever-present."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On 17 March 2015, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry would leave the Armed Forces in June. Before then, he would spend four weeks throughout April and May at army barracks in Darwin, Perth and Sydney whilst seconded to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). After leaving the Army, while considering his future, he would return to work with the Ministry of Defence, supporting Case Officers in the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme, working with both those who administer and receive physical and mental care within the London District area in a voluntary capacity. On 6 April 2015, Prince Harry reported for duty to Australia's Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australia. Harry flew to Darwin later that day to start his month-long secondment to the ADF's 1st Brigade. His visit included detachments to NORFORCE as well as to an aviation unit. While in Perth, he trained with Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), participating in the SASR selection course, including a fitness test and a physical training session with SASR selection candidates. He also joined SASR members in Perth for live-fire shooting exercises with numerous Special Forces weapons at a variety of ranges and completed an insertion training exercise using a rigid-hull inflatable boat. In Sydney, he undertook urban operations training with the 2nd Commando Regiment. Training activities included remotely detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and rappelling from a building. He also spent time flying over Sydney as co-pilot of an Army Black Hawk and participated in counter-terrorism training in Sydney Harbour with Royal Australian Navy clearance divers.

Does it follow that \\"They were never able to regain positions of responsibility.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not necessarily follow that \\"They were never able to regain positions of responsibility.\\" The statement \\"It took a long time for them to be readmitted to positions of responsibility\\" implies that they eventually managed to regain those positions, but it took a significant amount of time and effort. There are many factors that may have contributed to the prolonged time it took for them to regain positions of responsibility. Some factors may include changes in the social, political, or economic landscape, a need to prove their worth and capability to hold those positions, or barriers such as a bias or discrimination. In some cases, individuals face challenges in recovering from past mistakes, rebuilding their reputation, or acquiring new skills that are relevant to the positions they seek. It is not uncommon for people to face setbacks in their professional lives, and the time it takes for them to bounce back depends on various factors. However, the fact that it took a long time for them to be readmitted to positions of responsibility indicates that, ultimately, they were able to demonstrate their competence and regain the trust and confidence of those who had the authority to grant them those positions. This shows the importance of perseverance and adaptability in overcoming obstacles and achieving goals, especially when faced with significant challenges. The journey to regaining positions of responsibility may have involved learning from past mistakes, investing in self-improvement, and building a new network of professional connections. In conclusion, the statement \\"It took a long time for them to be readmitted to positions of responsibility\\" does not imply that they were never able to regain those positions. It only informs us about the considerable amount of time it took for them to achieve this goal. Their eventual success in regaining positions of responsibility serves as an example of the power of persistence, adaptability, and personal growth in overcoming adversity and achieving success."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The training of Neil was a lot more intense than that of Kenneth, due to","completion":"the fact that Neil needed to learn some really super-duper hard stuff, while Kenneth only needed to learn some simple things. You see, Neil and Kenneth were friends who were learning how to become special heroes. Neil was going to be a very powerful one, with all kinds of amazing abilities, like flying and lifting super heavy things. Because he was going to be so strong, Neil needed lots and lots of practice to learn how to use his powers properly. On the other hand, Kenneth had a different type of power. His job was to make people laugh, and you know, laughter is like a fun magic power that can heal and make people happy. Although it was still a very important job, Kenneth didn't need as much training because making people laugh was not as complicated as flying or lifting heavy things. So, Neil's training involved running, jumping, and practicing how to use his strength safely. He had to learn to control his powerful abilities so that he wouldn't accidentally hurt someone or break things. His trainer, Mr. Superstrong, was always by his side, helping him become the best hero he could be. Kenneth, on the other hand, spent most of his training with Ms. Gigglepants, learning different jokes, funny faces, and silly ways to entertain people. Even though it wasn't as hard or intense as Neil's training, Kenneth knew that making people laugh was his way of helping others and being a special kind of hero. Even though their trainings were different, Neil and Kenneth were still the best of friends, always cheering each other on and being there for each other. Sometimes, after a long day of training, they would sit together and share stories about all the adventures they hoped to have as heroes. Ultimately, both Neil and Kenneth became amazing heroes who saved the world in their own unique ways. When they worked together, Neil's strength and Kenneth's laughter proved to be a powerful team that brought happiness and safety to everyone around them.

The premise states that many people are sitting at a long dinner table at a formal event. This directly fulfills the hypothesis, which predicts that people are sitting at a table at the gathering. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis can be explained further by breaking down each component. Premise: Many people sit at a long dinner table at a formal event. Key elements: 1. Many people are involved 2. A long dinner table is present 3. The event is formal in nature Hypothesis: People are sitting at a table at the gathering. Key elements: 1. People are involved 2. A table is present 3. The gathering is taking place When comparing the key elements of the premise to those of the hypothesis, we find that they align well. 1. The premise specifies \\"many people,\\" which is consistent with the broader term \\"people\\" in the hypothesis. 2. Both the premise and the hypothesis contain the presence of a table, with the premise elaborating on the table being a \\"long dinner table.\\" This added detail strengthens the connection between the two statements. 3. Although the hypothesis uses the more general term \\"gathering,\\" it can easily encompass a formal event as described in the premise. The formality of the event does not negate or contradict the hypothesis. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it directly supports and confirms the hypothesis. The presence of people sitting at a table during a gathering is satisfied within the context of many people seated at a long dinner table at a formal event."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism.

He was the younger son of Nelle Clyde (nee Wilson; 1883-1962) and Jack Reagan (1883-1941). Jack was a salesman and storyteller whose grandparents were Irish Catholic emigrants from County Tipperary, while Nelle was of half English and half Scottish descent (her mother was born in Surrey). Reagan's older brother, Neil Reagan (1908-1996), became an advertising executive. Context: After completing 14 home-study Army Extension Courses, Reagan enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Officers' Reserve Corps of the Cavalry on May 25, 1937. On April 18, 1942, Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time. Due to his poor eyesight, he was classified for limited service only, which excluded him from serving overseas. His first assignment was at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation at Fort Mason, California, as a liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office. Upon the approval of the Army Air Forces (AAF), he applied for a transfer from the cavalry to the AAF on May 15, 1942, and was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the First Motion Picture Unit (officially, the \\"18th Army Air Force Base Unit\\") in Culver City, California. On January 14, 1943, he was promoted to first lieutenant and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of This Is the Army at Burbank, California. He returned to the First Motion Picture Unit after completing this duty and was promoted to captain on July 22, 1943. In January 1944, Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the opening of the Sixth War Loan Drive, which campaigned for the purchase of war bonds. He was reassigned to the First Motion Picture Unit on November 14, 1944, where he remained until the end of World War II. He was recommended for promotion to major on February 2, 1945, but this recommendation was disapproved on July 17 of that year. While with the First Motion Picture Unit in 1945, he was indirectly involved in discovering actress Marilyn Monroe. He returned to Fort MacArthur, California, where he was separated from active duty on December 9, 1945. By the end of the war, his units had produced some 400 training films for the AAF.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: To prepare the avocado pit for planting, Pick your answer from: -- boil the pit in water in a pan for 15 minutes.. -- wash the pit under warm running water..","completion":"To prepare the avocado pit for planting, you should wash the pit under warm running water. Here is a detailed, step-by-step process on how to prepare the avocado pit for planting: 1. Remove the pit: Start by eating or scooping the avocado fruit out, leaving the pit. Be gentle as you don't want to damage the pit during this process. 2. Clean the pit: Once you have the pit, you should wash it under warm running water to remove any remaining fruit residue. Use your fingers or a soft cloth to rub off any avocado flesh and rinse it until the pit is clean. 3. Identify the top and bottom of the pit: Observe the pit to determine which end is the top and which is the bottom, as the roots will grow from the bottom, while the stem will grow from the top. The bottom of the pit is usually the broader, rounder part, while the top is more tapered and pointy. 4. Soak the pit (optional): You can opt to soak the pit in a bowl of water for a few hours or overnight to provide some initial hydration before planting. 5. Pierce the pit: Take three or four toothpicks and insert them around the circumference of the pit, about halfway down. These toothpicks will serve as supports to suspend the pit over a container of water. 6. Prepare the container: Fill a jar, glass, or small vase with enough water that the bottom of the avocado pit can be submerged when the toothpicks are resting on the container's rim. 7. Suspend the pit in the container: With the toothpicks resting on the container's rim, the bottom of the avocado pit should be submerged in the water. Make sure to monitor the water level and replenish it if the level drops below the pit's base. 8. Provide sunlight: Place the container in a warm location with indirect sunlight, such as a bright windowsill. Avocado pits typically require moderate sunlight to facilitate growth. 9. Wait for root and stem growth: It may take several weeks or even months for the pit to start growing roots and a stem. Regularly change the water, preferably every week, to prevent the risk of mildew or mold growth and maintain a clean environment. 10. Transplant the avocado sprout: Once the roots are well established, and the stem is around 6-7 inches tall, you can transfer the avocado pit to a pot with soil. Bury the pit half-way into the soil, leaving the upper portion exposed. 11. Ensure proper care: Continue to provide the avocado plant with plenty of sunlight, well-draining soil, and water when the soil feels dry to the touch. In conclusion, to prepare an avocado pit for planting, you should wash the pit under warm running water, rather than boiling the pit in water in a pan for 15 minutes. Boiling the pit can damage the delicate tissues inside that are necessary for germination and growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She was a clever; hard-working girl and did well at school; especially in music and French. After she left school; her first job was to take care of the children of a rich family in Belgium . The language they spoke was French; so she found that her school studies were useful. She could understand them easily; at the same time she taught the children to speak English and play the piano. After hearing that her father was seriously ill; Edith returned home to look after him. She then decided to become a nurse. Afterwards for five years she worked in an English hospital where she proved to be highly professional at her job. A Belgian doctor was so impressed that he invited her to his country to organize a training school for nurses. The First World War broke out in 1914 and Edith Cavell's school of nursing became a hospital. She stayed there to look after the sick and wounded soldiers . Edith treated them with kindness. Between November 1914 and August 1915 she secretly helped about 200 wounded soldiers and prisoners escape from the Germans. Later the German army found out what Edith had done and they arrested her.

Today, we are going to talk about a famous singer named James Blunt. He wants to tell us more about his life and help us understand that what we believe may not always be true. James Blunt is a very talented singer who sings songs that many people like. He might look like he has a very fancy life, but he wants us to know that isn't always the case. In fact, he is just like you and me! First, let's talk about James Blunt's girlfriend. A girlfriend is a special friend that makes you happy when you're around them. People might think that James Blunt's girlfriend is a model, but she's not! She is actually a lawyer. A lawyer is a person who helps others with problems related to the law. James wants us to know that his girlfriend is more than just a pretty face. Just like anyone else, James Blunt has friends in all different jobs and it doesn't matter if they are models, lawyers, or even astronauts. Friends are important to have because they make us feel happy and loved. Now, let's talk about James Blunt's yacht. A yacht is a big and fancy boat that people use to travel on water. When we hear about famous people, we might think they all have big, fancy boats. But James Blunt wants us to know that his yacht isn't like that at all. In fact, his yacht is a blow-up dinghy! A blow-up dinghy is a small boat made of rubber that you can fill with air, just like a balloon. These boats are fun to use in the water, especially at the beach. They aren't as fancy as big yachts, but they can be lots of fun to play with. James Blunt wants everyone to understand that his life might not be as glamorous as people think. Just because he has a lot of fans and people who like his music, it doesn't mean he has a fancy girlfriend or a big, fancy boat. So kids, remember this: appearances can be deceiving! It's important not to judge people by what they look like or what we think we know about them. Everyone has their own story, and it's our job to listen and learn, just like we did today with James Blunt."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: You want to have fun and adventure and so you decide to travel somewhere to do it. Sounds like a simple enough thing. And basically it is. But what is adventure? That is the key here and the answer can be different for different people. For those who love sports, adventure travel can have a whole different meaning than for those who like history. The physical travel types that you can find include such adventure travel as white water rafting , kayaking or climbing and hiking to some mountains somewhere. To the hiker, backpacking across Ireland might be their adventure. For this type of person, adventure travel almost always includes something physical. Often the goal is to push their body's limits and test their individual endurance . For those who less want to climb mountains, adventure travel might mean traveling to Nepal and taking in the local festivals. Wine tasting in Italy is also vacation adventure for the more relaxed traveler who enjoys peace and comfort. Anything that is opposite to the normal scope of the traveler's lifestyle defines adventure. Adventure travel is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all type of vacation. Adventure depends on the person's physical limits, how much money the person has and what the person enjoys doing. Going _ the normal is adventurous for many. If your life is quite busy, then sitting on a beach in the moonlight with your family might be adventure for you.

You are also given a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph and the story. You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story.

Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Q: Background Paragraph: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. Story: Ben and Mike both studied earthquakes, while Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena. Question: Which person studied less about volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries? A:","completion":"Part #1: Causal or qualitative relationships in the background paragraph. Usage: \\"Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point.\\" This part explains the three ways that mantle melting can occur, which includes temperature, pressure, and water. It sets the foundation for understanding the topic of mantle melting and its connection to volcanoes. Part #2: The story's use of concepts or relationships mentioned in the background paragraph. Usage: \\"Ben and Mike both studied earthquakes, while Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena.\\" This part tells us who the characters are and what they study. Here, Mike's focus on mantle melting directly connects to the concepts described in the background paragraph. Part #3: The question which requires an understanding of relationships from the background paragraph and the story. Usage: \\"Which person studied less about volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries?\\" This question asks us to identify which character focuses less on the specific topic of convergent plate boundary volcanoes. To answer this, we must understand which part of the story and background paragraph refers to that subject and which character is more related to it. Part #4: Restrictions on the answer. Usage: \\"Your answer cannot consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question.\\" This means that we must only choose words from the given texts, ensuring that the answer is supported by the available information. Sample response: Ben. This meets the criteria because it is a character mentioned in the story, and according to the story, Mike is more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena, which includes volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Bicep contraction occurs when fibers get shorter, and ask you the question \\"what gets contracted when fibers get shorter?\\", is the correct answer \\"nerves\\"? Possible answers: * Yes * No Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"nerves.\\" When fibers get shorter during a bicep contraction, it is the muscle fibers that are contracting. In more detail, muscles are composed of different types of fibers known as muscle fibers (not to be confused with nerves); these are elongated, multinucleated cells that consist mainly of actin and myosin filaments. Bicep contractions occur as a result of the interaction between these actin and myosin filaments within the muscle fibers. This interaction is regulated by a complex set of biochemical processes involving various proteins and ions such as calcium. When a motor nerve impulse reaches the muscle, it triggers the release of calcium ions from storage structures inside the muscle cell, called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The increased intracellular calcium concentration binds to a protein called troponin, which is located on the actin filaments. This binding causes a conformational change in another protein called tropomyosin, moving it away from its blocking position on actin and exposing the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments. This exposure allows the myosin heads to bind to the actin filaments, forming cross-bridges between them. Then, utilizing energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the myosin heads tilt or \\"ratchet,\\" pulling the actin filaments toward each other, an action called the power stroke. This shortens the muscle fibers, resulting in muscle contraction. Following contraction, ATP binds to myosin, causing it to detach from actin, and the cycle repeats as long as the calcium concentration remains elevated. Once the nerve signal stops and the calcium concentration returns to its normal level, the muscle fibers relax and return to their original length. So in conclusion, when fibers get shorter during a bicep contraction, it is the muscle fibers that are contracting, not nerves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Information: - In mathematics, a planar lamina is a closed set in a plane of mass formula_1 and surface density formula_2 such that: - A prefectural-level municipality, prefectural-level city or prefectural city is an administrative division of the People's Republic of China (PRC), ranking below a province and above a county in China's administrative structure. Prefectural level cities form the second level of the administrative structure (alongside prefectures, leagues and autonomous prefectures). Administrative chiefs (mayors) of prefectural level cities generally have the same rank as a division chief of a national ministry. Since the 1980s, most former prefectures have been renamed into prefectural level cities. - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness. - Ili or Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in northernmost Xinjiang is the only Kazakh autonomous prefecture in China. - A shape is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture, or material composition. - An \\"oil field\\" or \\"oilfield\\" is a region with an abundance of oil wells extracting petroleum (crude oil) from below ground. Because the oil reservoirs typically extend over a large area, possibly several hundred kilometres across, full exploitation entails multiple wells scattered across the area. In addition, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities. - The surface area of a solid object is a measure of the total area that the surface of the object occupies. The mathematical definition of surface area in the presence of curved surfaces is considerably more involved than the definition of arc length of one-dimensional curves, or of the surface area for polyhedra (i.e., objects with flat polygonal faces), for which the surface area is the sum of the areas of its faces. Smooth surfaces, such as a sphere, are assigned surface area using their representation as parametric surfaces. This definition of surface area is based on methods of infinitesimal calculus and involves partial derivatives and double integration. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum. - Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - Karamay or Kelamayi is a prefecture-level city in the north of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China. The name of the city comes from the Uyghur language, and means \\"black oil\\", referring to the oil fields near the city. - Paint is any liquid, liquefiable, or mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects. Paint can be made or purchased in many colorsand in many different types, such as watercolor, synthetic, etc. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. - The Uyghur or Uighur language (Uyghur: ), formerly known as Eastern Turki, is a Turkic language with 10 to 25 million speakers, spoken primarily by the Uyghur people in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Western China. Significant communities of Uyghur-speakers are located in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and various other countries have Uyghur-speaking expatriate communities.

Steven Lee Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known for his work with the rock band Toto. A prolific session musician, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather has released seven solo albums, the latest of which, Transition, was released in January 2013. The 1989 album Lukather came about after Toto had been recording and playing for 11 years, and the consensus among the band members was to take a break. As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album, with the intention of presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with. He collaborated with many notable musicians, including Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Stevens, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich. Lukather has said that the album was produced very simply, and that a lot of ambient studio noise--counting off on various tracks, for instance--is audible on it. He also credits bands Pink Floyd, Cream, Led Zeppelin, and guitarists Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, and Eric Clapton as influences on the album. The single \\"Swear Your Love\\" came from the album. Candyman, recorded and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993, was a collaboration of musicians who were for the most part also in Lukather's band Los Lobotomys. Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield, John Pena, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee Waybill, Richard Page, and Paul Rodgers. Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing. Some international fans were confused about whether Candyman was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album. The Japanese and US releases of Candyman were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather's; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song \\"Red House\\". The European release of Candyman was credited to Lukather alone. Additionally, the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as \\"Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys\\" and sometimes as just \\"Los Lobotomys\\". The song \\"Borrowed Time\\" was released as a single in Europe and included \\"Red House\\" as a B-side. Lukather describes 1997's Luke as a much different and more \\"introspective\\" album than his previous two solo efforts. The album is a concentrated collection of many of Lukather's musical influences, and he deliberately let those influences come out on the album. Luke is an experimental album, and like Candyman it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards. Luke also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums: pedal steel, Harmonicas, Mellotrons, and experimental guitar, bass, and drum sounds. The US version of Luke includes a version of the Jeff Beck song \\"The Pump\\". The song \\"Hate Everything About U\\" was released as a single.

They go to the corner, introduce themselves and chat. She says she is learning to be an actress.Next scene we jump immediately to the end of a play, as the curtain is about to come down. We see April on stage upset, and Frank in the audience with a huge frown on his face. Some people clap and cheer and some are really disappointed with the play, walking by Frank as they go on about how terrible it was. Mrs. Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) walks by and compliments Frank that his wife was terrific in the play. Frank smiles and walks away.Frank goes backstage looking for April. On the way he sees Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn), who was also in the play. She tells Frank that she and her husband Shep (David Harbour) are ready for a drink. Frank agrees and goes to the private dressing room where he finds a devastated April changing. She asks Frank to tell Milly and Shep they cannot go out for a drink, using their nanny as an excuse. Frank and April argue a bit but Frank obliges. We then see a far shot of Frank and April leaving in the hallway of a high school with obvious distance between the two of them, not saying a word, even when they are in the car.While driving, Frank turns and tells April that it wasn't her fault that the play was bad, it was because it was unprofessional with lousy scripts and amateur actors and actresses around her. Not only does April not appreciate his comments, she asks Frank not to talk about it. They argue some more and Frank pulls the car over.

Write an article based on this summary: Conservationists and the green energy industry are demanding the Scottish government sets a new target to ensure half the country's power comes from renewables by 2030.","completion":"Title: Scottish Conservationists and Green Energy Industry Call for New Renewable Energy Target by 2030 Introduction The importance of renewable energy cannot be overstated in today's world where climate change is an ever-growing threat. Scotland, with its abundant natural resources, has the potential to capitalize on renewable energy sources and set an example for other nations in embracing green power. Conservationists and green energy industry members are urging the Scottish government to take stronger action and set an ambitious target for the nation's renewable energy output. They want to see at least 50% of the country's power supply generated from renewable sources by 2030. Scotland's Potential in Renewable Energy Scotland is blessed with a dynamic landscape and climate, offering various opportunities for clean energy solutions. From wind and wave power to hydroelectric and solar energy, there are numerous ways Scotland could tap into its rich environmental heritage to mitigate the damaging effects of fossil fuels on the environment and contribute to global sustainability goals. The Benefits of a New Target Setting an ambitious target for renewables will not only help address climate change concerns, but also come with potential economic benefits for Scotland. Investments in renewable energy infrastructure can pave the way for new job opportunities, revitalizing local economies and ensuring the nation remains competitive on a global scale. Moreover, green energy solutions can lead to energy security, reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels, as well as keeping energy prices affordable for consumers. Current Progress and Challenges Scotland is already making progress in the renewable energy sector. According to the Scottish government’s recent Energy Strategy report, 97.% of the nation's electricity demand was met by renewables in 2020. However, exceeding these figures through accelerated efforts will require collaboration between conservationists, the green energy industry, and the Scottish government. Key challenges include securing financial backing for renewable energy projects, modernizing the energy grid infrastructure, addressing concerns from local communities about the visual impact of wind turbines, and ensuring that wildlife and ecosystems are not negatively affected by these energy developments. United Call for Action As the demand for action from various stakeholders in the environmental and energy spheres increases, it is essential for the Scottish government to consider these voices and set a target that reflects both ecological stewardship and economic sustainability. A united front of conservationists, green industry players, and the general public can drive home the importance of this issue and provide a solid foundation for clean energy progress in Scotland. Conclusion With a wealth of natural resources available to them and the support of key industry players and conservationists, Scotland is well-positioned to achieve a renewable energy target that will significantly decrease its carbon footprint and contribute to global climate goals. It is now up to the Scottish government to seize this opportunity and make a commitment to leading the nation into a greener future by ensuring that half of the country's power comes from renewable sources by 2030."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ten years later, on the day before Thanksgiving, prominent private practice Manhattan child psychiatrist, Dr. Nathan R. Conrad (Michael Douglas), is invited by his friend and former colleague, Dr. Louis Sachs (Oliver Platt), to examine a disturbed young lady named Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) at the state sanatorium. Having been released from prison on November 4, Patrick and the remaining gang members break into an apartment which overlooks Nathan's apartment, where he lives with his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) and daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak). That evening, Patrick kidnaps the psychiatrist's daughter as a means of forcing him to acquire a six-digit number from Elisabeth's memory. As Nathan visits Elisabeth, she is reluctant at first, but he gains her trust laterâespecially when he reveals that his daughter has been kidnapped and will be killed if he doesn't get the number they want. Dr. Sachs admits to Nathan that the gang who kidnapped Jessie also kidnapped his girlfriend to force him to acquire the number from Elisabeth. Sachs is then visited by Detective Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito) who reveals to him that his girlfriend has been found dead. Meanwhile, Aggie hears Jessie's voice and realizes the kidnappers reside in the apartment nearby. The kidnappers send one of them to kill Aggie while the others escape with Jessie, but Aggie sets an ambush and kills him.

The player who committed the foul is then required to exit the game for a predetermined amount of time and sit in an area off the field, typically labeled 'the penalty box.' They must remain in this penalty box for a specific duration, leaving their team with one less player on the field thus giving the opposing team an advantage. This is known as a power play. While it's true that physical contact does occur in other sports such as football, there is no 'penalty box' concept in football or in running races.

News article: ‘People love the gory ones,” a newspaper editor tells Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) early on in “The Raven,” and presumably that line was part of the producers’ original pitch meeting. I’m guessing the phrase “ ‘Se7en’ meets ‘Sherlock Holmes’” was tossed about, too. A grimly preposterous serial-killer thriller set in 19th-century Baltimore, this riff on the final days of the author of “The Tell-Tale Heart” and other masterpieces of the macabre might qualify as literary desecration if it weren’t so silly. Cusack’s Poe — conceived here as close cousin to Robert Downey Jr’s Holmes — is a talented wreck whose best days are behind him but who can still rear up and spit in the eye of the philistines, of which there are many in 1849 Baltimore. They include his editor (Kevin McNally) and Captain Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson), wealthy and extremely hostile father to Poe’s beloved Emily (Alice Eve). A depraved murderer is stalking the city, killing citizens in ways that copycat the author’s famous stories. A gruesome early highlight is the longtime Poe rival (John Warnaby) who gets the pit-and-pendulum treatment in disgusting detail. “But I’m only a critic!” he shrieks before expiring. I felt much the same way. Initially a suspect, Poe ends up joining forces with the police inspector on the case, the manly Detective Fields (Luke Evans). The two race desperately from one horrific crime scene to the next — at a masked ball, in a church, backstage at a theater, in the sewers of Baltimore — and they’re led hither and thither by a mastermind whose cunning and resources seem increasingly far-fetched. “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Cask of Amontillado,” “The Mystery of Marie Roget” — so many tales to choose from. “The Premature Burial” is reserved for Emily, who in Eve’s performance treats the ordeal as a particularly bad hair day. “The Raven” has been directed by James McTeigue (”V for Vendetta”) with dark style and at galloping speed, neither of which disguise the fact that the movie often doesn’t make a lick of sense. If it were content to lighten up and admit it was trash, there might be some fun to be had, but the dialogue by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare mistakes the florid for the eloquent. (“God gave him a spark of genius and quenched it with misery,” someone says about Poe.) The jolts are effective in their Pavlovian way; it’s everything else that lets you down. Sadly, the overripe notion of Edgar Allan Poe, action hero, never takes off. Cusack wants to give a serious performance — historically inaccurate goatee and all — in a movie that isn’t built for it. (Let’s hope Benjamin Walker in this summer’s “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter” doesn’t have the same problem.) The star is pale enough to qualify for a Tim Burton movie but he’s awfully well-fed to play late-stage Poe, and he never summons up the glint of madness you get in photographs of the author. Behind the blowhard arrogance, Edgar seems eminently sane ­— not exactly what’s called for. What “The Raven” lacks in narrative invention it makes up for by pushing the audience’s face in blood, guts, and hacked flesh. You get that the filmmakers are going for a modern take on Poe’s Gothic vision, but their approach has no poetry and barely any prose. After the “Holmes” movies, “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,” and this, the steampunk-action genre may be played out. Quoth the audience, “Nevermore.” Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com.

Hamilton Brendan Gleeson Maddox Kevin McNally Relativity Media presents a film directed by James McTeigue. Written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare. Running time: 111 minutes. Rated R (for bloody violence and grisly images). Printer-friendly » E-mail this to a friend » On Oct. 3, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe was found wandering the streets of Baltimore, raving and incoherent. He died on Oct. 7, at age 40. His death was about as much of a surprise as the passing of such modern icons as Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse. Poe was an acute alcoholic, particularly fond by the notorious spirit absinthe. He also used opium and who knows what other substances, and as a man supported only by his writings, may have been badly nourished. This is a lifestyle known to lend itself to incoherent wanderings. \\"The Raven,\\" a feverish costume thriller, attempts to explain Poe's death by cobbling together spare parts from thrillers about serial killers. It should not be mistaken for a movie about Edgar Allan Poe, although to be sure, he buys a drink for a man in a tavern who is able to complete this line of poetry: \\"Quoth the raven…\\" When I heard that John Cusack had been cast for this film, it sounded like good news: I could imagine him as Poe, tortured and brilliant, lashing out at a cruel world. But that isn't the historical Poe the movie has in mind. It is a melodramatic Poe, calling for the gifts of Nicolas Cage. The film opens with Poe on a Baltimore park bench, beneath a tree limb holding a large, malevolent raven. Mad magazine would know what to do with that image. Then it flashes back to Poe, broke and in serious need of a drink, bursting into a tavern and expecting to imbibe on credit. He boasts of his fame, issues \\"The Raven\\"-quoting challenge and immediately establishes himself as a disappointment to those who find Poe a complex and fascinating man. Poe wrote fiction that is read for pleasure to this day. He has possibly inspired more movies than anyone except Shakespeare. In \\"The Raven,\\" we quickly meet one of his editors, Henry Maddox (Kevin McNally), editor of a trashy Baltimore tabloid, who orders Poe to return to the lurid horror tales he's famous for, instead of his more introspective recent stuff. Poe soon finds the inspiration for macabre material. Two women are discovered murdered in a locked room. Emmett Fields (Luke Evans), the detective on the case, discovers that the killer must have escaped in the same way used in Poe's \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\\" It has slipped from Fields' memory that the killer in that tale was an orangutan, but never mind: Poe becomes a suspect. Shortly after, a man is discovered sliced in two in the manner used in Poe's \\"The Pit and the Pendulum.\\" It is a grievous death: The victim cries out that he is too insignificant to justify such a laborious means of death; after all, he screams, \\"I'm only a critic.\\" Now Poe and Fields find themselves working in tandem, since the killer is apparently a man willing to go to much trouble to draw attention to the works of Poe. A rich young woman named Emily (Alice Eve) is kidnapped, and ransom notes demand that Poe write an account of their investigation for Henry Maddox's scandal sheet. \\"The Raven\\" now indulges in a plot that will remind you of any number of serial-killer movies, in which we're expected to believe that a madman goes to astonishing trouble while killing a lot of people simply to devise an elegant puzzle for the hero to solve. This can work nicely, as in \\"Se7en,\\" but in \\"The Raven,\\" it is all concoction, a device to link Edgar Allan Poe with modern serial-killer formulas and shovel in a great deal of special-effects violence. The use of sensational effects may be a temptation for a director like James McTeigue, whose first feature, \\"V for Vendetta\\" (2005), was actually pretty good. They create a problem of proportion for a period film like this, where personality and atmosphere should create suspense; extreme violence is unnecessary, although I realize that at least some Friday-night moviegoers will be hoping for it and have only a vague notion of when 1849 might have been. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"\\"The Raven\\" is a film set in 19th-century Baltimore, portraying a fictional tale of Edgar Allan Poe's final days interwoven with a serial-killer thriller. The movie follows Poe, played by John Cusack, as he reluctantly teams up with Detective Fields to catch the gruesome killer using the author's stories as inspiration for the murders. Despite its attempts at modernizing Poe's gothic vision with blood and gore, the movie has been criticized for its melodramatic take on Poe's character and a lack of narrative invention.

In the rural German village of Vandorf, seven murders have been committed within the past five years, each victim having been petrified into a stone figure.

Question: What is the full professional name of the person who sand lead vocals in his bands cover of \\"Act Naturally\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Not all hiking trips will be the same and there are varying styles of backpacks that can meet the demands of these differences. Depending on the length of your hike and the gear you need to carry you will need to purchase a backpack with the correct frame style. Backpacks with external frames are mainly used for heavy and asymmetrical loads. An internal frame backpack might be right for you if you need to maintain stability and don't need to carry heavy items. Frame-less backpacks are for those hikers who don't need to carry much gear with them and like to move quickly on their hike. Hiking backpacks will need to be fitted exactly to the size of your torso. Any backpack that isn't the right size won't fit correctly and will be uncomfortable or may cause injury. Measure your torso's length and hip width before you buy your backpack to ensure a great fit. Measure your torso's length by starting from the top bump at the base of your neck down to your hip level. Measure your hips to make sure that the hip belt will fit. Your hip measurement will be taken just above where your pants normally rest. Before you load up your backpack and head out hiking you will need to properly fit your backpack. Try wearing your backpack and then making adjustments using the straps on your backpack where needed. There will generally be four main areas to adjust including the hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps. The hip-belt should fit snugly around your hips and will support much of the weight. Shoulder straps should pull the bag tight against your back but not actually carry much of the weight. Some backpacks will have load-lifting straps. These should relieve the weight from your shoulders and help keep it properly distributed. The sternum strap will pull the weight up and away from your shoulders and should fight tightly and comfortably across your chest. When it comes to hiking backpacks, it is ideal to visit a store where you can try on the backpacks in person. Although you might know your measurements, each backpack might fight differently in actuality. Try on plenty of backpacks before purchasing one to make sure you find the right fit. If you are unable to visit a store you may still be able to try a backpack and return it free of charge if the manufacturer allows for it.","completion":"Hiking trips can be quite varied in terms of duration and the type of gear required, making it essential to choose a backpack with the appropriate frame style. There are three primary backpack frame styles, each designed to cater to specific hiking needs: external frames for heavy and asymmetrical loads, internal frames for maintaining stability without carrying heavy items, and frame-less backpacks for lightweight gear and agility. In order to ensure a comfortable and well-fitted backpack, hikers must accurately measure their torso length and hip width before making a purchase. The torso length is measured from the base of the neck to the hip level, while the hip measurement is taken just above where one's pants typically rest. Having the correct backpack sizing is crucial in preventing discomfort and possible injuries. Once the backpack has been purchased, it is important to properly adjust it for a comfortable fit. This typically involves tweaking four main adjustment areas: hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps. The hip-belt should fit snugly around the hips, taking on most of the weight, while shoulder straps should help keep the bag close to the back without bearing much weight. Load-lifting straps, if present, are designed to alleviate shoulder weight and maintain even distribution. Lastly, the sternum strap should fit tightly across the chest, lifting the weight away from the shoulders. To ensure the most accurate fit, it is recommended that hikers visit a store to try on backpacks in person. This allows for a better understanding of how each backpack fits and accommodates individual measurements. However, if visiting a store is not possible, some manufacturers may offer a try-and-return policy that allows customers to return the backpack free of charge if it is not a suitable fit. Overall, selecting and adjusting the right backpack is essential for a comfortable and successful hiking experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Wallpaper was peeling off our hotel room wall. In the sports book, the chair I was sitting in looked like it had been chewed on by a dog. The stuffing was coming out of it.

The complaints about WiFi, coffee makers, cable TV, and mini-fridges convey that the author is unhappy with the available amenities. 4. The mention of not seeing a cocktail waitress after 40 minutes at a slot machine conveys frustration with the service. 5. Complaints about bartenders and wallpaper in the hotel room further indicate dissatisfaction. 6. Describing a chair as chewed on by a dog and with stuffing coming out suggests that the author thinks the furnishings are poor. 7. Regarding the players club perks, the author sarcastically asks, \\"Man is that a perk or what??\\" implying disappointment with the rewards program. 8. The author concludes by saying, \\"This place stunk!!!\\" which is a strong negative statement. Based on these points, I can conclude that this review is negative. The author expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment with various aspects of the resort, such as amenities, services, and overall quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The events described took place over two days, with the kidnapping being carried out by a group of armed individuals, who also abducted the engineer's driver and interpreter at the same time. In order to further understand the context of this summary, it is important to highlight the key points: 1. Kidnapping Incident: The Turkish engineer, alongside his driver and interpreter, was abducted by a group of armed men in eastern Afghanistan. This suggests that the event happened in an area of continuing conflict and possible instability, with armed groups resorting to kidnapping as a form of violence and intimidation. 2. Victim: The primary victim in this case is a Turkish national who was working as an engineer in Afghanistan. This highlights a potential risk for foreign professionals working in conflict-affected areas due to their vulnerability to being targeted by such armed groups. It also demonstrates that engineers and others involved in infrastructure development are not immune to the dangers that prevail in regions marred by conflict. 3. Discovery of the Body: The engineer's body was found riddled with bullets, indicating that he had been brutally murdered after his abduction. This outcome not only further emphasizes the potential danger faced by foreign professionals working in conflict zones, but also underscores the ruthlessness and brutality employed by the armed men involved in the kidnapping. 4. Status of the Other Abductees: The news summary only specifically mentions the discovery of the Turkish engineer's body but does not provide details on the condition or whereabouts of the driver and interpreter who were kidnapped alongside him. This leaves open questions about their status, outcome, and the motivations behind the armed group's actions. 5. Officials' Involvement: The information about the incident was provided by officials, suggesting that law enforcement and other authorities are aware of and addressing the situation. However, the limited details shared about the case also raise questions about the effectiveness of the authorities in dealing with such crimes in the region. In conclusion, this news summary highlights a troubling incident in eastern Afghanistan where a Turkish engineer was brutally murdered after being kidnapped along with his driver and interpreter. The case underscores the dangers faced by professionals in conflict-affected areas and brings attention to the challenges faced by local authorities in preventing and addressing such crimes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

According to Hogan & Astone (1986), this transition can include markers such as leaving school, starting a full-time job, leaving the home of origin, getting married, and becoming a parent for the first time. However, the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture. In some countries, such as the United States, adolescence can last nearly a decade, but in others, the transition—often in the form of a ceremony—can last for only a few days. Now answer this question: Does the time frame of adolescence vary from culture to culture or remain universally agreed upon?","completion":"The time frame of adolescence varies from culture to culture.

The doctors in Children's Hospital are asking for money for children's toys. Some children in the hospital must stay in bed for many weeks. Toys are needed to keep these sick children happy and quiet. Money for them can be sent to the hospital.

Let's begin to make toys tomorrow,\\" said Mrs. Weeks. On Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Weeks took the children to the hospital with the toys made by her students. The children in the hospital felt very happy to see the toys. The children in the class felt happy, too. A few days later, Mrs. Weeks read another newspaper story to the class: Some school pupils brought toys to Children's Hospital last week.

Sentence 2: They had a heads up about them joining the team. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence, let us analyze both sentences closely and understand their context. Sentence 1 states that \\"David Plotz foretold Brown's departure in a recent Slate Assessment.\\" This suggests that David Plotz, presumably a writer or analyst, predicted that Brown would be leaving a specific organization or group, and this prediction was published in a Slate Assessment. The main focus of this sentence is the prediction of Brown's departure. Sentence 2 states that \\"They had a heads up about them joining the team.\\" This implies that someone (they) was given prior notice or information about a person or individuals (them) joining a team. The main focus of this sentence is the prior knowledge of someone's arrival or inclusion in a team. Based on the provided information, it is difficult to assert that the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. The two sentences seem to be addressing two different scenarios - one pertaining to a departure and the other concerning an arrival or joining of a team. For the second sentence to be true based on the first sentence, there should be an explicit link between Brown's departure and the subsequent joining of the team by someone else. However, the connection between these two events is not made clear in either of the given sentences. In conclusion, since there isn't a clear reference or connection between Brown's departure and the joining of the team by someone else, we cannot firmly establish the truthfulness of the second sentence based on the truth of the first sentence.

This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks.

This is also unique for each element. Q: The atomic number is the same as the number of what in an atom? A: A:","completion":"The atomic number in an atom is the same as the number of protons within the nucleus of that atom. An atomic number is an important identifier for a chemical element as it helps to define their distinct identity and characteristics. Each element has a unique atomic number, which represents the fundamental property of an atom, thereby distinguishing one element from another. Protons are subatomic particles with a positive electric charge, and they exist in the nucleus of an atom along with neutrons (which have no charge). The arrangement of electrons, which are negatively charged particles that circle the nucleus in specific energy levels or electron shells, is also dependent on the number of protons in the nucleus. Since electrons have a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton, the overall electric charge of the atom is neutral, with the quantity of protons and electrons being equal in a stable, uncharged atom. To summarize, the atomic number is the same as the number of protons in an atom and is used to identify and differentiate chemical elements based on their unique properties and characteristics. The atomic number also helps to determine the configuration of electrons around the nucleus, playing a crucial role in the atom's behavior, reactivity, and interactions with other species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Garibaldi was born and christened Joseph-Marie Garibaldi on 4 July 1807 in Nice, which had been directly annexed by First French Empire in 1805, to Ligurian family of Giovanni Domenico Garibaldi from Chiavari and Maria Rosa Nicoletta Raimondo from Loano. In 1814, the Congress of Vienna returned Nice to Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia; nevertheless, France re-annexed it in 1860 by the Treaty of Turin, which was ardently opposed by Garibaldi. Garibaldi's family's involvement in coastal trade drew him to a life at sea. Garibaldi returned to Italy amidst the turmoil of the revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states and offered his services to Charles Albert of Sardinia. The monarch displayed some liberal inclinations, but treated Garibaldi with coolness and distrust. Rebuffed by the Piedmontese, he and his followers crossed into Lombardy where they offered assistance to the provisional government of Milan, which had rebelled against the Austrian occupation. In the course of the following unsuccessful First Italian War of Independence, he led his legion to two minor victories at Luino and Morazzone. After the crushing Piedmontese defeat at Novara (23 March 1849), Garibaldi moved to Rome to support the Republic recently proclaimed in the Papal States, but a French force sent by Louis Napoleon (the future Napoleon III) threatened to topple it. At Mazzini's urging, Garibaldi took command of the defence of Rome. In fighting near Velletri, Achille Cantoni saved his life. After Cantoni's death, during the Battle of Mentana, Garibaldi wrote the novel Cantoni il volontario. On 30 April 1849 the Republican army, under Garibaldi's command, defeated a numerically far superior French army. Subsequently, French reinforcements arrived, and the siege of Rome began on 1 June. Despite the resistance of the Republican army, the French prevailed on 29 June. On 30 June the Roman Assembly met and debated three options: surrender, continue fighting in the streets, or retreat from Rome to continue resistance from the Apennine mountains. Garibaldi made a speech favoring the third option and then said: Dovunque saremo, cola sara Roma. (Wherever we may be, there will be Rome). A truce was negotiated on 1 July, and on 2 July Garibaldi withdrew from Rome with 4,000 troops. The French Army entered Rome on 3 July and reestablished the Holy See's temporal power. Garibaldi and his forces, hunted by Austrian, French, Spanish, and Neapolitan troops, fled to the north with the intention to reach Venice, where the Venetians were still resisting the Austrian siege. After an epic march, Garibaldi took momentary refuge in San Marino, with only 250 men still following him. Anita, who was carrying their fifth child, died near Comacchio during the retreat. How did the war end?","completion":"The war ended with the French prevailing on 29 June.

The Donkey Kong shelf should resemble the iconic game with its sloping platforms and ladders. Here is a list of materials and tools, followed by a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this goal. Materials: 1. Plywood or MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard): This will provide a solid, smooth, and sturdy base for your shelf. You will need enough to create the platforms, ladders, and side panels. Calculate the dimensions of the shelf you desire and purchase the plywood or MDF accordingly. 2. Wood screws: These will be used to secure the platforms, ladders, and the side panels together. 3. Wood glue: This will offer additional support and hold the pieces together. 4. Wood putty: This will help in filling any gaps and holes, creating a smooth finish. 5. Primer: This prepares the surface for painting, ensuring an even and long-lasting finish. 6. Paint: You will need colors like red, blue, yellow, white, and black, to accurately represent the Donkey Kong theme. 7. Clear sealant (optional): You can use a clear polyurethane or sealant to protect the painted surfaces and increase durability. 8. L-brackets and wall anchors: These will be used to secure the shelf to the wall. Tools: 1. Saw: A jigsaw or circular saw will be needed to cut the plywood or MDF to the desired dimensions. 2. Drill: You'll need a drill to attach the platforms, ladders, and side panels using wood screws. 3. Screwdriver: This will be used for tightening the wood screws. 4. Pencil: A pencil will assist in marking measurements and guiding cuts. 5. Measuring tape/ruler: This will help in taking accurate measurements. 6. Sandpaper: This will help in smoothing the edges and surfaces. 7. Paintbrushes and/or rollers: These will be used for applying paint, primer, and clear sealant. Step-by-step guide to accomplish the goal: 1. Plan and design: Create a blueprint or sketch of your Donkey Kong shelf, including the desired dimensions and number of platforms. 2. Measure and cut: Measure and cut the plywood or MDF into the appropriate sizes for platforms, ladders, and side panels. 3. Sand surfaces and edges: Smooth out all surfaces and edges with sandpaper to prepare for assembly and painting. 4. Assemble the structure: Attach the platforms to the side panels using wood screws. Ensure that the platforms are placed at an angle to mimic the iconic game design. Attach the ladders to the platforms using wood screws as well. Apply wood glue to the joints to provide additional support. 5. Fill gaps and holes: Use wood putty to fill any gaps or holes, and sand the surface for a smooth finish. 6. Apply primer: Apply a coat of primer to the entire assembly, making sure it dries thoroughly before moving on to the next step. 7. Paint: Paint the shelf following the Donkey Kong theme, making sure to include the iconic colors and designs of the game. 8. Seal (optional): Apply a clear coat of sealant to protect the painted surface and increase its durability. 9. Attach to the wall: Use L-brackets and wall anchors to secure the shelf to the wall safely and firmly. 10. Enjoy your Donkey Kong shelf: Place your cherished items, games, or memorabilia on the shelf and admire your handmade creation. In conclusion, creating a Donkey Kong shelf requires the right set of materials, tools, and a step-by-step approach. With careful planning, measuring, cutting, and painting, you can build a shelf that is both functional and nostalgic, celebrating the iconic arcade game."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Q: Instead of a nervous system, plant responses are generally controlled by what type of molecules, which serves as chemical messengers? Choices: - receptors - enzymes - sugars - hormones A: The answer is:","completion":"- Hormones Plant responses are generally controlled by hormones, which serve as chemical messengers in various aspects of plant growth, development, and overall function. Unlike animals that have a complex nervous system to regulate their responses, plants rely on hormones to convey information within them and coordinate essential processes. Plant hormones are organic substances that are produced by plants in small amounts. They help to regulate a wide array of physiological activities, such as growth and development, reproductive activities, cellular processes, and responses to environmental stimuli. Some of the major plant hormones include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene. Here's a brief overview of their roles: 1. Auxins - These hormones are responsible for promoting cell elongation, stimulating tissue growth, and coordinating processes related to phototropism (plant growth in response to light) and gravitropism (plant growth in response to gravity). Auxins are also crucial in managing apical dominance, where the main shoot of a plant inhibits the growth of lateral (side) shoots. 2. Gibberellins - These hormones play a vital role in cell growth and elongation, stem elongation, seed germination, flowering initiation, and fruit development. Gibberellins work in conjunction with auxins to support many key growth processes in plants. 3. Cytokinins - These hormones act as the primary regulators of cell division, differentiation, and overall development. Additionally, cytokinins help maintain overall plant health by delaying senescence (aging) in leaves and regulating nutrient allocation. 4. Abscisic Acid (ABA) - This hormone plays a significant role in plant adaptation to environmental stress, such as high or low temperatures, drought, and salinity. ABA is essential in processes like stomatal closure (to reduce water loss through transpiration) and seed dormancy (to delay germination under unfavorable conditions). 5. Ethylene - A gaseous hormone, ethylene is involved in regulating fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf senescence. It is also responsible for the \\"triple response\\" mechanism that allows seedlings to navigate around obstacles in dark environments, such as soil. In conclusion, plant responses are mainly controlled by hormones, which serve as chemical messengers and play a vital role in regulating various processes like growth, development, reproduction, and adaptation to environmental conditions. These complex signaling molecules allow plants to manage their physiological activities without the need for a centralized nervous system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gloria Borger says the president must wonder how he got into this predicament. Obama decided to largely back Bush's surveillance policies, she says. Borger: Obama should lead the debate over security rather than just listen to it.","completion":"Title: President Obama's Dwindling Approval Ratings: A Closer Look into His Predicament and the Need for Leadership in Security Debates Introduction Recent poll numbers reveal that President Barack Obama's popularity has taken quite a hit. With many Americans growing increasingly dissatisfied with his handling of various issues, political analyst Gloria Borger suggests the president must be wondering how he ended up in this predicament. By delving into the crux of the matter, one can identify Obama's decision to back former President George W. Bush's surveillance policies as a pivotal factor contributing to his decreasing support. This article will highlight the importance of President Obama leading the debate over security and surveillance policies rather than merely listening to it, emphasizing his need to take proactive measures to win back public trust. The Predicament: Supporting Bush's Surveillance Policies One might be tempted to ask, \\"Why is President Obama's approval rating plummeting despite his promises of change?\\" The answer lies in his unexpected support for the controversial surveillance policies enacted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. This decision has left many Americans feeling betrayed, given Obama's campaign emphasized transparency and civil liberties. In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration implemented several surveillance measures designed to identify and prevent potential threats to national security. These policies, however, were met with significant criticism, as they were seen as an infringement on citizens' privacy and civil liberties. When Obama took office, many expected him to dismantle these controversial policies. Instead, the president not only continued to support them but expanded some of these programs. As a result, Obama's perceived commitment to transparency and civil liberties was called into question, contributing to his dwindling approval ratings. The Need for Leadership: Obama's Role in the Security Debate In light of the public's growing discontent with his administration's surveillance policies, President Obama must take the initiative in leading the debate over national security and striking a balance between ensuring the safety of the nation and respecting individual privacy rights. By merely listening to the debate on national security policies and deferring to others, President Obama effectively loses the opportunity to guide the narrative and address citizens' concerns directly. Displaying proactive leadership in the ongoing debate is essential for the president to regain public confidence and demonstrate that he values and respects the civil liberties of Americans. The Path Forward: Striking a Balance Between Security and Privacy To win back the trust of the American public, President Obama must act swiftly in reassessing the current surveillance policies and finding a balance between the protection of national security and honoring civil liberties. This involves reevaluating the extent to which the government monitors private communications and seizing the opportunity to lead the conversation on the necessity of surveillance programs in today's world. A prime example of striking this balance is establishing stricter guidelines and increased oversight for surveillance programs, ensuring that the government's watchful eye does not overstep the boundaries of personal privacy. By communicating these changes to the public, President Obama can assure the people that their rights will be protected while still maintaining the measures necessary to ensure national security. Conclusion In conclusion, President Obama's approval ratings will continue to suffer as long as he avoids addressing the concerns surrounding his support of George W. Bush's surveillance policies. By taking the lead in the security debate and working towards policies that balance national security with civil liberties, Obama has the opportunity to win back public trust and restore his administration's credibility. Upholding the values of transparency and civil rights, which he had professed during his election campaign, is crucial for President Obama to reestablish his image as a leader who is genuinely committed to the prosperity and safety of the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason arrived to eliminate Donald from her post at the town hall, because","completion":"he had received numerous reports of Donald's incompetency and misuse of her position. As the newly appointed City Manager, Jason understood the importance of a well-functioning town hall, since it was crucial for the administrative and bureaucratic tasks that kept the town running smoothly. Step 1: Gather evidence and establish a case Before taking any action, Jason knew it was important to have concrete evidence to support the claims against Donald. He had already gone through various complaints from the townspeople and conducted preliminary interviews with some of her subordinates who were affected by her actions. For example, he found that Donald had been taking extended breaks during work hours and neglecting her duties, resulting in delays in public services. Step 2: Confront Donald and give her an opportunity to explain Even though there was ample evidence pointing toward Donald's incompetency, Jason wanted to offer her a fair chance to defend herself. He scheduled a meeting with Donald to discuss the allegations against her and explore any possible misunderstandings or misrepresentations. During the meeting, he asked her questions about her performance and the reasons behind her actions, trying to keep an open mind, listening carefully to her explanations. Step 3: Evaluate and make a decision After the meeting, Jason went back to analyze the facts and Donald's side of the story. He compared her explanations to the existing evidence and sought input from other members of the town hall staff to ensure that the final decision was objective and unbiased. After a thorough evaluation, Jason came to the conclusion that Donald's mismanagement and negligence were indeed harming the town hall's operations. Step 4: Consult with the legal department Before eliminating Donald from her post, Jason knew it was essential to ensure that the decision was legally sound. He consulted with the legal department at the town hall, discussing the evidence and Donald's explanations to understand the proper course of action and the legal implications of the termination. The legal department guided Jason on the termination process and the steps that must be followed for compliance with employment laws. Step 5: Notify Donald and the town hall Once Jason was certain that the decision was justified and legally compliant, he notified Donald about the termination of her position. He provided her with an official notice, outlining the reasons behind the decision and the terms of her dismissal. Additionally, Jason informed the town hall staff about Donald's elimination and the reasons for it, emphasizing the importance of responsible behavior and good work ethics. Step 6: Implement measures to prevent future mismanagement To avoid similar situations in the future, Jason planned and implemented measures aimed at improved supervision and communication among the town hall staff. He organized regular meetings to discuss ongoing projects and concerns, established a performance evaluation system, and encouraged an open-door policy wherein staff could voice their concerns directly to the City Manager. Through these steps, Jason not only eliminated Donald from her post but also paved the way for better management at the town hall, ensuring a more efficient administration and happier townspeople."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Quique Kierszenbaum/Getty Images) Israel arrested at least 25 members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas in a raid early Monday morning, according to the BBC. It's reported three members of the Palestinian parliament — Hatem Kafisha, Mohammad Al-Tal and Ahmad Atoun — were also arrested. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group, and though the government confirmed the arrests to the Associated Press, they did not give specifics on why the arrests were made. \\"Overnight 25 Palestinians were arrested all over the West Bank,\\" the Israeli army said. The AP also reported that among those detained was an unidentified man responsible for reconciliation talks between Hamas and its political and secular opponent Fatah. Hamas denounced the arrests, saying they undermine Palestinian reconciliation efforts between themselves and President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah Party, according to Haaretz. Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, an executive committee member of the multi-party group Palestinian Liberation Organization, strongly condemned the arrests of Palestinian lawmakers. “With such arbitrary arrests, Israel has violated international law and the most basic norms of human rights,\\" Ashrawi said in a press release Monday. \\"Israel is not above the law. Therefore, we call on all parliaments — Arab, European and international — to hold Israel accountable and to ensure the release of Palestinian lawmakers,\\" he con Today's raid is not unprecedented.

Bank designed to foil efforts to reconcile with Fatah. Hamas legislator Ahmed Attoun. Photo: Sam Sokol Defiant Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip said that the arrest of the movement’s political representatives in the West Bank by the IDF was designed to sabotage efforts to achieve reconciliation with Fatah. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said that the arrests won’t “obstruct Hamas’s role in defending the Palestinians and their lands and holy sites.” Barhoum said the arrests were primarily designed to foil efforts to achieve reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas. The IDF crackdown on the Hamas leadership came as representatives of the movement and Fatah prepared to launch fresh reconciliation talks in Cairo in a bid to end their dispute. Hamas legislator Salah Bardaweel condemned the IDF crackdown, but also criticized the Palestinian Authority for detaining Hamas supporters in the West Bank. Bardaweel called on the Egyptians to exert pressure on Israel to secure the release of the Hamas men. Palestinian sources said the Hamas officials were arrested in pre-dawn raids on their homes in Nablus and Hebron. An IDF spokeswoman confirmed that 23 Hamas members were taken into custody out of a total of 25 arrests made Monday. The arrests occurred in Nablus, Ramallah, Kalkiliya, and Hebron. Speaking to The Jerusalem Post, a senior defense source said the arrests were part of a wider effort to prevent Hamas from assembling an infrastructure in the West Bank. “It’s part of the ‘lawn mowing’ that is required to stop Hamas from converting street popularity and its motivation into organizational achievements,” the source added. Among those arrested, according to Palestinian sources, are three Hamas legislators: Ahmed Attoun, Mohamed al-Tal and Hatem Kafisheh. Ahmad Attoun was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006. He was exiled to the West Bank from Israel two years ago after being detained in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. He had been living in the headquarters if the Red Cross there for over a year in order to avoid arrest due to his refusal to renounce his allegiance with Hamas. The IDF also arrested top Hamas figures Adnan Asfour, Baker Bilal and Omar al-Jabarini. In recent days, the Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank also arrested several Hamas operatives, including some who had just been released from Israeli prison. PLO Executive Committee member Dr. Hanan Ashrawi on Monday condemned the arrest of several Palestinian lawmakers, calling the arrests “arbitrary” and accusing Israel of “deliberately breaching international law and conventions relating to the immunity of democratically elected Palestinian officials.” “It is apparent the Israeli government is implementing a policy of intimidation and power politics to meddle in Palestinian domestic affairs and to undermine reconciliation efforts,” she said. She called on the international community to “hold Israel accountable and to ensure the release of Palestinian lawmakers.” Sam Sokol and Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In February 2013, the Israeli army arrested 25 Hamas members, including three parliamentarians, during a nighttime operation in the West Bank.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six. - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 . - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

Background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Paragraph: Keith is an environmental scientist. He was studying the loss of ozone layer and its effect on different species. His data showed that in the beginning or twentieth century there were hardly any loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time period as time A. Further inquiry revealed that things didn't go well at the end of twentieth century - when there were severe loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time as time B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would skin cancer be more prevalent or less prevalent in time A than in time B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Skin cancer would be less prevalent in time A than in time B. This is because the paragraph states that there was hardly any loss of the ozone layer in the beginning of the twentieth century (time A), while there was severe loss of the ozone layer at the end of the twentieth century (time B). Since ozone layer depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth, which subsequently increases the incidence of skin cancers in humans, it is more likely that skin cancer was less prevalent during time A compared to time B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve for the variable Let's start with Step 1: Isolate the variable. The equation we are trying to solve is: -93*l + 274 = -191 Now, let's isolate the variable l. To do that, we will move '274' to the other side of the equation. Since it's a positive number, we will subtract '274' from both sides.

Process: - Acid rain leaches aluminum from clay particles in soil - Aluminum flows into streams and lakes - Acid rain dissolves minerals and nutrients in soil - Washes them away so plants can&#x27;t benefit from them - PH in soil and water gets affected which can kill plants and animals - Acid rain in fog at higher elevations can strip foliage off trees. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose stronger fuel type happens, how will it affect more Aluminum is taken from the soil. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests a stronger fuel type that potentially has more sulfur and nitrogen compounds when burned. This would lead to increased emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are primary precursors to the formation of acid rain. The increased acid rain formation due to stronger fuel types would have the following effects on the process: 1. Enhanced leaching of aluminum: More acid deposition in the soil would enhance the leaching of aluminum from clay particles. This can happen because the increased acidity would dissolve the aluminum-containing minerals more efficiently, releasing even more aluminum ions into the soil. 2. Increased aluminum in streams and lakes: As a consequence of enhanced leaching, the concentration of aluminum in streams and lakes would also increase. High concentrations of aluminum can be toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish, leading to a decline in biodiversity and affecting the entire aquatic ecosystem. 3. Greater loss of minerals and nutrients: The increased presence of acid rain would lead to the dissolution of more minerals and nutrients in the soil, washing them away before plants can absorb and benefit from them. This would lead to reduced plant growth and productivity, as well as decreased soil fertility. 4. Lower pH in soil and water: The higher amounts of acid rain would cause a more significant drop in the pH of both soil and water. Lower pH levels can be harmful to plants and animals, as they may not be able to tolerate the acidic conditions. This could lead to the death of plants, invertebrates, and other sensitive species. 5. Stripping of foliage at higher elevations: Higher concentrations of acid rain in fog in mountainous regions can cause even more severe damage to vegetation. The acid droplets in fog can strip foliage off trees, leading to reduced growth, susceptibility to pests and pathogens, and eventual tree death. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis with a stronger fuel type would likely lead to more aluminum being taken from the soil and cause further adverse effects on ecosystems due to higher acidity levels from increased acid rain. The perturbation would have a direct effect on the process, leading to amplified negative consequences in affected areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. + no. + yes.","completion":"Yes, both questions are essentially the same. They both inquire about the effects of banning 500 and 1000 rupee notes on the Indian economy. Now let's discuss the effects of this ban in detail: On November 8, 2016, the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, announced the demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes. This action was taken with the primary goal of curbing corruption, black money, tax evasion, and counterfeit currency. The decision had a significant impact on various aspects of the economy. 1. Cash-based businesses and industries: The sudden withdrawal of high-denomination currency notes led to a significant cash crunch in the economy. Businesses and industries that primarily operated on a cash basis, such as real estate, gold and jewelry, retail, and unorganized sectors, were negatively impacted due to the sudden liquidity shortage. 2. Banking Sector: Banks experienced a surge in deposits as people rushed to exchange their old notes for new ones. This led to increased liquidity within the banking system, enabling banks to reduce lending rates. However, the initial days following the announcement witnessed longer queues, chaos, and a spike in transaction charges pertaining to ATM usage and online transactions. 3. Inflation and GDP: In the short term, demonetization led to a decrease in consumer spending, as people faced difficulties making daily transactions with limited access to the new currency. This reduced demand resulted in a temporary decrease in inflation but also impacted India's GDP, witnessing a slowdown in the growth rate. 4. Tax Compliance: Demonetization improved tax compliance by incentivizing the use of digital payments and making it difficult for individuals and businesses to evade taxes. It resulted in an increased number of income tax return filings and a wider tax base, promoting transparency and accountability in the economy. 5. Effect on Counterfeit Currency: Banning the 500 and 1000 rupee notes helped curb the circulation of counterfeit currency, as the new notes introduced enhanced security features that were difficult to replicate. This directly impacted terror funding and other illegal activities financed through counterfeit currency. 6. Digitalization and Financial Inclusion: To counter the cash shortage, the government heavily pushed for digital payments, promoting cashless transactions through the use of banking cards, mobile wallets, and other digital platforms. This accelerated the adoption of digital payment systems, enhancing financial inclusion, and increasing the use of formal banking channels. 7. Influence on the Parallel Economy: The immediate effect of demonetization was a significant crackdown on the parallel or black economy. The ban on high-denomination notes forced those holding unaccounted cash to either declare it and face penalties or lose its value. This move, to some extent, curtailed the black market and reinforced the formal economy. In conclusion, the ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes in India had multiple effects on the economy. While it did negatively impact some sectors and caused temporary inconvenience to the public, the long-term benefits included improved tax compliance, reduced counterfeit currency circulation, increased digitalization, and a consolidation of the formal economy. The overall impact of demonetization is a multifaceted and complex subject, with both pros and cons that continue to be debated among policymakers and economists."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: Opposition parties have questioned why an investment deal worth up to £10bn signed by Scotland's first minister and a Chinese consortium was \\"kept quiet\\". Article:","completion":"Title: Scotland's First Minister Faces Scrutiny Over Hushed £10bn Investment Deal with Chinese Consortium Introduction Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has come under scrutiny from opposition parties as details emerge concerning a potentially massive investment deal worth up to £10bn, signed with a Chinese consortium. Critics argue that the deal, which has the potential to significantly boost Scotland's economy, has been intentionally \\"kept quiet.\\" As the controversy grows, questions are being raised about transparency in the Scottish government and the nature of the deal itself. Background A two-year-old memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Scottish government and a consortium comprising two major Chinese companies - SinoFortone and China Railway No.3 Engineering Group – was recently discovered by the media. The document outlines potential investments in a range of sectors including infrastructure, transportation, and renewable energy, all with the aim of fostering economic growth in Scotland. The two Chinese companies involved in the consortium are significant entities in their home country. SinoFortone is a major investor which specializes in infrastructure projects, while China Railway No.3 Engineering Group is one of the largest construction and engineering firms in China. Their combined expertise and financial resources can undoubtedly make a substantial impact on Scotland's economy and facilitate much-needed development. Controversy Over the Quiet Deal Despite the potential benefits of the deal, controversy has arisen primarily due to its lack of publicity. Opposition parties have expressed concern regarding the seemingly secretive nature of the agreement. They argue that such a significant deal, potentially involving vast sums of money and consequential development projects, should have been made public to ensure transparency and accountability. The lack of information and public consultation about the deal has fueled speculation and concern. Some fear that the agreement may be tilted in favor of the Chinese consortium, potentially jeopardizing national interests. Additionally, there are concerns about the environmental and social implications of the projects resulting from the deal, which remain unclear due to the lack of available information. Government's Defense In response to the criticism, the Scottish government has defended its actions, stating that it did not attempt to hide the deal. A government spokesperson stated that the MoU was publicly available in the Scottish Parliament's information center but acknowledged that the government did not actively seek to publicize it. The Scottish government maintains that the MoU merely represents a starting point for establishing and building relationships for potential future collaborations, and does not guarantee any specific projects or investments. Furthermore, the government insists that any project emerging from the deal would be subject to the necessary transparency, scrutiny, and regulatory safeguards. Conclusion As the controversy around the £10bn investment deal continues to unfold, the Scottish government is under increasing pressure to provide greater information and transparency. The potential for the deal to have a significant impact on Scotland's economy cannot be denied; however, the process by which it has been approached calls into question the government's commitment to openness and accountability. With both the potential benefits and risks associated with the secretive nature of this agreement, the issue has underscored the need for transparency and public consultation in such major deals. Failure to meet these expectations may not only damage the credibility of the Scottish government but also undermine the long-term potential of the investment agreement itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - circadian cycle - carbon cycle - life cycle - cell cycle A: Answer:","completion":"The timing of events in the cell cycle, which lasts just minutes in fruit fly embryos, is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell. The cell cycle is a series of stages that a cell goes through in order to divide and produce new cells. It is crucial for the growth, development, and maintenance of all living organisms. In fruit fly embryos, the cell cycle is particularly rapid, taking only a few minutes to complete. However, despite this rapid pace, the events within the cell cycle must be carefully regulated for the organism to develop properly. This regulation involves a complex interplay between internal and external cellular mechanisms. Internal mechanisms, or cell-autonomous mechanisms, refer to the processes within a cell that govern the progression of the cell cycle. These mechanisms rely on a complex network of proteins and enzymes that interact with each other to ensure proper timing and coordination of cell division events. One internal regulation system is the molecular checkpoint system. This system uses protein complexes to monitor critical events such as DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and other processes that need to be completed before the cell moves on to the next phase of the cycle. For instance, the G1 checkpoint ensures that the cell has adequate energy and resources before proceeding to DNA synthesis (S phase), while the G2 checkpoint ensures that DNA replication is complete before initiating cell division (mitosis). External mechanisms, or cell-non-autonomous mechanisms, involve factors outside the cell that can impact cell cycle progression. These external factors are often mediated through cell signaling pathways. Signaling molecules, such as growth factors, are essential for coordinating cell growth and division across different cells in developing tissues. In the case of fruit fly embryos, external mechanisms might include signals from neighboring cells or tissues, as well as environmental factors that influence cell division and differentiation. For example, one well-studied signaling pathway in fruit flies is the Notch signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in cell-fate determination and tissue organization. In conclusion, the rapid cell cycle observed in fruit fly embryos depends on the intricate balance between internal and external mechanisms that work together to regulate the timing of events within the cycle. Both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous processes collaborate to ensure proper cell division, coordination, and overall development of the organism. While all the possible choices (i.e., circadian cycle, carbon cycle, life cycle) play a vital role in biological systems, it is the cell cycle that specifically addresses the question's context of timing and cellular regulatory mechanisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is threatening Dirk's plans? Movie plot title: Campbell's Kingdom Movie plot: Recently diagnosed with a terminal disease, Bruce Campbell (Dirk Bogarde) unexpectedly finds himself the owner of a small valley in the Canadian Rocky Mountains as the result of a bequest from his grandfather.[1] After travelling from England, Bruce arrives at \\"Campbell's Kingdom\\" (as the locals disparagingly call it) to find its existence under threat from the construction of a new hydroelectricity dam. Convinced that his grandfather was right and that the Kingdom may be prospective for oil, the race is on to prove that there is oil under Campbell's Kingdom before the mining company building the dam can flood the valley. Standing in his way is corrupt construction contractor Owen Morgan (Stanley Baker), who resorts to dirty tricks in order to prevent Campbell from succeeding in his quest. However, Bruce is ably and enthusiastically assisted by love interest Jean Lucas (Barbara Murray), geologist Boy Bladen (Michael Craig) and drilling contractor James MacDonald (James Robertson Justice). Unfortunately for Campbell the residents of the nearby town of Come Lucky invested heavily in his grandfather's schemes, only to feel cheated when his projects came to nothing. Gradually Bruce manages to turn them around by exposing the fraud and lies of Morgan and the mining company. Answer:","completion":"The main threat to Dirk's (Bruce Campbell) plans in the movie \\"Campbell's Kingdom\\" is the construction of a new hydroelectricity dam by a mining company. This dam, once completed, would flood the valley, which is the area Dirk has inherited from his grandfather. Moreover, the corrupt construction contractor, Owen Morgan, poses a significant challenge to Dirk's plans. Morgan uses dirty tactics and lies with the intention of preventing Dirk from proving that there is oil under Campbell's Kingdom. His actions serve to protect the interests of the mining company constructing the dam and undermine Dirk's pursuit of proving the existence of oil in the valley. Additionally, Dirk faces skepticism and resistance from the residents of the nearby town of Come Lucky, who had invested heavily in his grandfather's schemes and felt cheated when they were unsuccessful. This initial lack of support from the locals makes it more difficult for Dirk to rally a team to help him expose the fraudulence and deception of Morgan and the mining company. However, over time, Dirk does manage to gain the trust and assistance of several individuals, including Jean Lucas, Boy Bladen, and James MacDonald, in his endeavors to uncover the truth and save Campbell's Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kevin Jeffrey Clash (born September 17, 1960) is an American puppeteer, director and producer whose characters include Elmo, Clifford, Benny Rabbit, and Hoots the Owl. Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age and began performing for local TV children's shows in his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, as a teenager. In the early 1980s, he began working in Captain Kangaroo and began performing in Sesame Street in 1984. He was the fifth puppeteer to perform Elmo, the character he became the most famous for and became an executive producer and director for the show. Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons, and Great Space Coaster ended, freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street. Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983, mostly performing nondescript, stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets. Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl (based on Louis Armstrong), the infant Baby Natasha, and inventor Dr. Nobel Price. After 1985, Elmo, a furry red monster, became his main character. Four puppeteers, including Richard Hunt, had performed Elmo previously, but it was Clash's development, with a falsetto voice, that established the character. He based Elmo's character on the preschool children that attended his mother's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents. Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz, who told Clash to always \\"find one special hook\\" for each character. Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he \\"should represent love\\". After the height of Elmo's popularity, especially the \\"Tickle Me Elmo\\" craze in 1996, Clash's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased. He recruited, auditioned, and trained its puppeteers, and became the senior Muppet coordinator, a writer, director, and co-producer of the \\"Elmo's World\\" segment of the show. Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street's international co-productions. He found working with the co-productions \\"a lot of fun\\" and \\"very rewarding\\". He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird. In 2007, he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop. Until 2011, he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances, making his schedule, as he called it, \\"crazy\\". Cheryl Henson, president of the Jim Henson Foundation, called him \\"essential\\" to the show. Clash worked on the first film version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in 1990 and the sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, which was dedicated to Henson, in 1991, voicing Master Splinter. He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions, including as the Muppet Clifford in The Jim Henson Hour (1989), and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz's characters (Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Sam the Eagle, and Animal) in Muppet Treasure Island (1996). Clash performed in the films Muppets from Space (1999) and The Muppets' Wizard of Oz (2005), and the TV series Muppets Tonight (1996--1998), in which he reprised Clifford, who served as the show's host. He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs. In 1999, Clash worked on a film starring Elmo, The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. In 2006, Clash published his autobiography, co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell, entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud. His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey.

Article: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed.

Here is a premise: \\"A man is admiring art in a museum.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The museum is totally empty and abandoned.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise, \\"A man is admiring art in a museum,\\" does not give us enough information to determine whether the hypothesis, \\"The museum is totally empty and abandoned,\\" is true or not. While we can gather some information from the premise, it is insufficient to confirm or refute the hypothesis directly. Let's discuss this in more detail. In the premise, we learn that the man is admiring art in a museum. This indicates that the museum is open to visitors and has exhibits on display. However, we do not get any information about other visitors or the overall state of the museum. For the hypothesis that \\"the museum is totally empty and abandoned,\\" it seems to contradict the fact that the man is admiring art in the museum because it suggests that a visitor is present. However, \\"totally empty\\" could potentially be interpreted as empty of other visitors or staff. But even with this interpretation, there is still insufficient information in the premise to confirm or refute this possibility. Additionally, the term \\"abandoned\\" in the hypothesis would typically mean that there is no ongoing maintenance or management in the museum. This would be unlikely in a museum where someone is visiting and admiring art. One could assume that if the museum is open to visitors, it must be functioning to some extent, even if it is not bustling with people. However, the premise does not provide any information regarding the museum's management, maintenance, or overall state. In conclusion, the premise \\"A man is admiring art in a museum\\" does not tell us whether the hypothesis \\"The museum is totally empty and abandoned\\" is true or not. While some aspects of the hypothesis appear to contradict the premise, other aspects could be consistent with it if given a certain interpretation. However, the premise does not offer enough details for us to confirm or deny the hypothesis definitively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"In 1958 the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"The process of determining the number of series in hockey before the Stanley Cup can be a bit complicated, as it has changed over the years. However, to answer your question as accurately as possible, we must consider the current format of the NHL playoffs and the historical context of the Stanley Cup. Currently, a total of four playoff series are played before a team is awarded the Stanley Cup. These series are: 1. Division Semifinals: The top four teams from each of the four NHL divisions qualify for the playoffs, and the first round consists of a series of four best-of-seven matches within each division. The first seed faces the fourth seed, while the second and third seeds compete against each other. 2. Division Finals: The two remaining teams in each division face off against each other in another best-of-seven series, with the winners being crowned division champions and moving on to the next round. 3. Conference Finals: The two division champions within each conference (Eastern and Western) then play against each other in a best-of-seven series, with the winner moving on to the Stanley Cup Final. 4. Stanley Cup Final: The Eastern Conference and Western Conference champions compete in a final best-of-seven series, with the winner being awarded the Stanley Cup. Now, regarding the statement \\"In 1958, the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band,\\" this information refers to the physical design of the Stanley Cup trophy. The original Cup had a base with rings, and each year, the winning team's information was engraved onto one of these rings. The 1958 design change created a larger trophy with additional space for more winners' engravings without significantly altering the iconic look of the Cup. While the statement you provided is accurate in terms of the Cup's design, it does not directly address the number of series played in hockey before the Stanley Cup is awarded. However, understanding how the playoffs are structured and the historical context of the Stanley Cup is essential for appreciating the significance of the trophy and the challenges that teams face on their quest for hockey's ultimate prize."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A large group of people have formed a line outside.\\", can we conclude \\"A group of people line up behind the great Cthulhu for a raging party.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"A group of people line up behind the great Cthulhu for a raging party\\" based solely on the statement \\"A large group of people have formed a line outside.\\" While the first statement describes a group of people lining up outside, it does not provide any information or context to determine the reason for the line or the presence of the great Cthulhu. The statement \\"A large group of people have formed a line outside\\" is a general observation that could apply to various scenarios. It could be that these people are waiting in line for a bus, attending a public event, or queuing for a store opening. There are a multitude of possible reasons that can cause people to form a line, and without additional information, it is impossible to determine their intentions or motivations. The second statement, \\"A group of people line up behind the great Cthulhu for a raging party,\\" is a specific and imaginative scenario involving the fictional cosmic entity created by H.P. Lovecraft. It is important to recognize that Cthulhu is a character from popular literature, rather than an entity that could realistically host a party. Consequently, this statement is more likely to be a creative interpretation or a metaphorical expression than a literal description of the situation. To conclude that the group of people was, in fact, lining up for a party hosted by the great Cthulhu, we would need more information to substantiate the connection between the line and the party. For instance, if there was a known event or gathering themed around the Cthulhu mythos and expected to be a \\"raging party,\\" it might be reasonable to make such an assumption. However, without any context that corroborates the connection, it would be purely speculative. In summary, while both statements describe a group of people forming a line, the reason for their formation cannot be determined from the initial statement alone. Additional information would be needed to link the line outside to the great Cthulhu and a raging party, and without any such context, the two statements cannot be conclusively connected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What happens to kids when visiting museums of old dinosaur bones? Possible A: crowding, retrospection, amazement, being bored, excited Why is \\"amazement\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Amazement\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons when considering what happens to kids when they visit museums of old dinosaur bones. Firstly, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to the general appeal of dinosaurs and the context in which children experience them at the museum. 1. Intrigue and fascination: Dinosaurs are a subject of great curiosity and fascination for many people, especially children. Their sheer size, unique appearance, and the fact that they ruled the Earth millions of years ago create an aura of mystery and wonder. When children come face-to-face with actual fossils and bones of these giant creatures, it is a direct encounter with natural history, which often evokes a sense of amazement. 2. Educational experience: Visiting a museum and viewing dinosaur bones offer an educational experience for children by exposing them to new information about the Earth's past, various species, and the evolution of life. The amazement they experience can also inspire further learning, research, and exploration into paleontology, evolution, and other related fields. The connection between amazement and education is aligned with human common sense, as it signifies a deepening of knowledge and understanding. 3. Visual impact: The presentation and aesthetic appeal of dinosaur bones in museums play a significant role in generating amazement among children. The bones are usually arranged and displayed in a manner that showcases their monumental size, intricate details, and the relationships between different species or time periods in an accessible and engaging fashion. The visual impact of these displays can leave children in awe. 4. Imagination and creativity: Encountering dinosaur bones in a museum setting allows children to exercise their imagination and creativity. They can imagine what these creatures looked like, how they behaved, their environment, and the dynamic world they inhabited. This imaginative process is an essential part of fostering cognitive development and is closely tied to the human sense of amazement. 5. Emotional connection: As humans, we are social beings who are often drawn to the stories of others. The story of dinosaurs and their ultimate extinction resonates with people on an emotional level, which can elicit a sense of amazement as we ponder the vastness and complexities of life on our planet. For children, the emotional connection is further enhanced by the depiction of dinosaurs in popular culture, such as movies, games, and books. In conclusion, the answer \\"amazement\\" is aligned with human common sense because it encapsulates the various factors that contribute to the experience of visiting a museum with old dinosaur bones. From fascination and education to imagination and emotional connection, amazement is a natural and intuitive response for children who are exposed to these awe-inspiring exhibits that offer unique insights into our planet's history and the magnificent creatures that once roamed Earth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve -2815*f + 13524 = -3781*f for f. What is the solution?","completion":"Okay, little buddy! Let's solve this math problem together. We want to find out what \\"f\\" is. Here's the problem: -2815*f + 13524 = -3781*f First, let's add 2815*f to both sides of the equation to move all \\"f\\" terms to one side. We do this by changing the -2815*f to a positive 2815*f: -2815*f + 2815*f + 13524 = -3781*f + 2815*f Now, on the left side, -2815*f and 2815*f cancel each other out, so we have: 13524 = -3781*f + 2815*f Next, let's combine the \\"f\\" terms on the right side: 13524 = (-3781 + 2815)*f Now we find the result of -3781 + 2815: 13524 = -966*f Finally, let's find out what \\"f\\" is by dividing both sides by -966: 13524 ÷ -966 = -966*f ÷ -966 It simplifies to: f = -14 So, the solution for \\"f\\" is -14.

Casey is taking his estranged niece Sarah to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Sarah's father. Sarah and Casey board the Grand Continental, a train traveling from Denver to Los Angeles through the Rocky Mountains. Armed mercenaries, led by former U.S. government computer hacker and computer genius Travis Dane and mercenary leader Marcus Penn, hijack the train. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top-secret military satellite particle weapon designed to destroy underground targets. The military fired Dane because of his mental instability; Dane later faked his suicide. The mercenaries take the train's passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one mercenary, then slips away. Among the hostages are two former Department of Defense colleagues who worked with Dane. Dane threatens them with torture unless they reveal the codes to take over Grazer. Despite giving up the codes, they are thrown from the train into a deep valley and killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane 1 billion to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese chemical weapons plant. After one investor offers an additional 100 million, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife.

Create a table \`dp_table\` of dimensions (n+1) x (m+1), where n is the length of list A, and m is the length of list B. Initialize all elements in the table to 0. 2. Iterate through the elements in both lists A and B.

What is the best way to: Make jar labels easier to remove.","completion":"The best way to make jar labels easier to remove involves using various techniques and materials to loosen the adhesive bond between the label and the jar surface. You often have to deal with stubborn labels on jars that may need repurposing, recycling, or simply cleaning. To simplify this task, follow these step-by-step instructions using different methods that work best for you: 1. Warm soapy water method: a. Fill a sink or basin with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap. b. Immerse the jar completely, ensuring that the label is submerged in water. Let it soak for 30 minutes to an hour. c. Remove the jar and use a sponge or a cloth to gently rub off the label. The warm soapy water should have loosened the adhesive, making it easier to remove. d. If the label doesn't come off in one piece, repeat the soaking process. e. Once the label is removed, clean off any residue with a sponge or cloth. 2. Heat application: a. Using a hair dryer, apply heat directly to the label for 30-60 seconds. Keep the hair dryer 2-4 inches away from the jar surface. b. The heat will loosen the adhesive, allowing you to peel off the label with your fingers or a plastic scraper. c. If the label doesn't come off entirely, reapply heat and continue scraping gently. d. After the label is removed, clean the remaining adhesive residue with warm soapy water or rubbing alcohol. 3. Vinegar or rubbing alcohol method: a.

It just shattered ! Glass went everywhere ! ! ! Question: Why caused the saucepan to explode ?","completion":"To determine the cause of the saucepan explosion, let's examine the sequence of events you described step by step and hypothesize why it happened: 1. You left the green beans cooking too long: This may have led to the green beans burning and producing smoke. Prolonged heating can cause the temperature inside the saucepan to rise significantly. 2. The buildup of heat and pressure: As the green beans continue to cook while giving off smoke, there could be a buildup of steam and pressure inside the saucepan. The lid, being tightly sealed, could be preventing this excess heat and pressure from escaping. 3. The glass lid shatters: With the increasing pressure and temperature inside the saucepan, the glass material of the lid is subjected to both thermal and mechanical stresses. If the lid is not made of heat-resistant or tempered glass, it may not be able to withstand these stresses. Based on these steps, we propose that the saucepan's glass lid exploded due to the buildup of heat and pressure inside the saucepan, caused by the prolonged cooking of the green beans. The glass lid, unable to withstand the heat and pressure, shattered under the stress. To prevent this from happening in the future, ensure to monitor your cooking time and use heat-resistant cookware."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the event that you're unable to access websites that are blocked on your Internet connection, however, you'll need to use a VPN. VPNs can be difficult to install on monitored or controlled computers (e.g., library, school, or work machines); however, if you use a personal computer for work, you should be able to install the VPN while on your own wireless network. Many websites, such as Facebook and YouTube, have mobile alternatives that can be visited by typing \\"m.\\" between the \\"www.\\" section of the website's address and the website's name. Many blocking services do not account for the mobile versions of blocked sites. For example, you would access the mobile version of Facebook by going to \\"https://www.m.facebook.com/\\" in your browser. You can find a website's IP address, which is its raw numerical address, on any major computer platform, after which point you can enter the IP address into the browser's URL bar the same way that you'd search for a regular address (e.g., \\"https://www.google.com/\\"). This won't work for all websites; some services hide their IP addresses, and others use multiple IP addresses which aren't always reliable. If you don't have access to Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) on the computer on which sites are blocked, you can use a personal computer on an unrestricted network to find the IP address and then just use the address on your restricted computer. This method doesn't always work, but it provides a simple alternative to using a proxy site or a portable browser: Go to https://translate.google.com/ in your browser.

Acest fond, înființat în 2006 de către Comisia Europeană, are drept scop să sprijine lucrătorii care au pierdut locurile de muncă datorită globalizării și evoluțiilor structurale ale economiei mondiale. Cazurile Belgiei și Irlandei reflectă dificultățile pe care le întâmpină angajații din aceste țări din cauza globalizării și a crizei economice și financiare.

Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. and the situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Answer the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The number of animals is likely to increase, or at least be better preserved, under Milly's plan. By advocating for a decrease in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, Milly is promoting a plan that addresses the issue of global warming and climate change, which is responsible for the extinction of natural habitats and reduction in wildlife population. Therefore, her plan would be more effective in protecting and preserving the ecosystem and animal species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which is this about? This is the time of the year when Americans nationwide are gobbling up gobblers at grocery stores for holiday dinners. But out on Darrell French #39;s","completion":"ranch in southwestern North Dakota, the gobblers aren't just found in the meat aisle – they're roaming the countryside and flourishing in their natural environment. Darrell French's ranch is a haven for these magnificent birds, and it provides an ideal setting to delve deeper into the life of wild turkeys and the rich American tradition of hunting and consuming them, especially during the holiday season. Wild turkeys, unlike their domesticated counterparts, are much more agile and have a more diverse diet. Unlike domesticated turkeys, which are often bred for their breast size and weight, wild turkeys have a more balanced proportion of white and dark meat. As a result, their meat has a richer, more nuanced flavor and is a delicacy among many Americans. During the holiday season, demand for turkey meat skyrockets as families gather together to celebrate and enjoy traditional dishes such as roasted turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. Many people take this opportunity to purchase fresh, free-range turkey meat from local farms and ranches, such as Darrell French's. The appeal of these locally sourced birds lies in their improved taste, texture, and overall quality compared to mass-produced supermarket turkeys. At Darrell French's ranch, the turkeys roam freely and engage in their natural behaviors. They can forage for their preferred diet, which consists of wild berries, seeds, insects, and grasses. This type of diet contributes to the unique flavor of their meat, which is praised for its gamey taste. Additionally, the turkeys have a healthy lifestyle and adequate exercise due to their freedom to roam, which also helps their muscles develop naturally, giving the meat a firmer texture. Moreover, wild turkeys play a significant role in the ecosystem. They help disperse seeds and control insect populations, promoting biodiversity. Furthermore, they serve as prey for species such as coyotes, foxes, and birds of prey, helping to maintain a balance in the food chain. Turkey hunting is another deep-rooted American tradition, particularly during the fall season. Hunters, like those who frequent Darrell French's ranch, play a critical role in controlling turkey populations and preventing overpopulation. This sustainable form of hunting helps maintain a healthy balance between the turkey population and the surrounding ecosystems. Darrell French's ranch represents an ideal model of responsible wildlife management and agriculture. The impact of his practices extends beyond simply contributing to holiday feasts; he actively supports the environment and wildlife conservation through responsible ranching and hunting practices. In summary, Darrell French's ranch in southwestern North Dakota showcases the importance of wild turkeys in the culinary and ecological aspects of American culture. The ranch serves as a testament to the advantages of sustainable and ethical farming practices, providing a high-quality food source for the holidays, supporting biodiversity, and preserving timeless American traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The housing market there still languishes. New Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged to Nevada Republican Sen.

This meant an increased focus on luxury offerings, from five-star dining establishments to high-end retail outlets and cutting-edge entertainment options, in an effort to attract visitors with more disposable income. With competition on the rise, the aim was to provide an all-encompassing, unique entertainment experience that went beyond the traditional gaming-centric model. However, this upscale move also signifies a certain desperation on the part of the Nevada gaming industry. As the allure of gambling diminishes across the U.S and more states are opening their doors to casinos, it becomes less of an exclusive activity that you could only do in places like Las Vegas. This has led to casinos looking for other ways, such as becoming a high-end tourist destination, to maintain their revenue. Yet, even this solution is proving not to be sufficient for a full economic recovery. As the state's junior U.S. senator highlighted, Nevada is still grappling with significantly high unemployment rates and a sluggish housing market, a scenario that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledges will potentially take years to overturn. The situation in Nevada, particularly that of Las Vegas, is indicative of wider issues in the U.S. economy. Despite apparent markers of success - crowded casinos, sold-out shows - there exist undercurrents of economic instability. This suggests that the health of the U.S economy might not be as robust as surface indicators might imply, but rather nuanced, thereby requiring multi-faceted solutions for sustainable growth and recovery. It is a strong reminder that economic progress can’t just be viewed on the surface level, but requires deeper analysis and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am...

How is \\"You.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, \\"You.\\" is translated as \\"Ty.\\" The Czech language, like many other Slavic languages, distinguishes between formal and informal pronouns for addressing people. \\"Ty\\" is singular and informal, used when addressing someone you know well, like a close friend, a family member, or someone younger than you. When addressing someone formally or someone you don't have a close relationship with, you would use \\"Vy,\\" which signifies politeness and respect. This is typically used in professional settings, when speaking to strangers, or those who hold a higher position or status. Furthermore, Czech is an inflected language, which means the endings of words change depending on their grammatical function in a sentence.

We have the equation: 2107*u - 136 = 2124*u Think of 'u' as the number of candies you have. Step 1. Our goal is to find out how many candies ('u') you have. To do that, we need to have all the candies on one side of the equation. So, we'll move the 2107 candies next to the 2124 candies. To do that, we'll subtract 2107 candies from both sides: 2107*u - 2107*u - 136 = 2124*u - 2107*u This simplifies to: -136 = 17*u Step 2. Now, we have -136 = 17 * candies (u). To find the number of candies (u), we need to divide -136 by 17. -136 / 17 = -8 So, -8=candies (u). That means the answer is u=-8.

The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is a breed specifically developed for hunting small game as a scenthound, known for its excellent scenting abilities and endurance. The breed originated from crossing French scenthounds with English foxhounds to achieve the desired traits. The primary purpose of this breed is hunting, and that is what it has been optimized for over the years. The breed's name \\"Petite Vénerie\\" is not an indication of the size of the dog but rather the type of game it is used to hunt - small game. Based on the information given, it is impossible to say that the Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie dog is not only used for hunting but also for some other purpose. While it's possible that some individuals of this breed might be employed in other activities, there is no clear evidence presented to claim that their primary purpose extends beyond hunting. Without additional information on the other roles they might play, it is unreasonable to assume that they have functions other than hunting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: Since the founding of Freemasonry, many Bishops of the Church of England have been Freemasons, such as Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher. In the past, few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practicing Freemasonry. In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England. In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.

This is a crucial initial step, as it helps to ensure that the water is at the right temperature to effectively clean the dishes and break down any grease or stubborn food particles. In most dishwashers, this process starts when the user selects a cleaning cycle and initiates the dishwasher's operation. The heating element located at the bottom of the dishwasher begins to heat up, increasing the water temperature to the level necessary for the selected cycle (usually between 120°F to 160°F / 49°C to 71°C). This higher temperature not only aids in the removal of dirt and food particles on the dishes but also helps to kill harmful bacteria and sanitize the dishes. Heating the water is a critical step as it prepares the dishwasher for the subsequent phases of cleaning and ensures that the dishes will be cleaned most effectively.

Complete the following sentence. they had a big struggle to fit the shoes into the sacks, the","completion":"The main issue they faced was that the shoes were small in comparison to the sacks that were available for use. The problem seemed insurmountable at first because there was a significant difference in the sizes of the shoes and the sacks, which made it incredibly difficult for them to adequately fit the shoes into the sacks without wasting a lot of space or risking damage to the shoes. They had a big struggle to fit the shoes into the sacks, primarily due to the disproportionality between the sizes of the two items. The shoes, while small and delicate, needed to be stored securely and without being crushed or deformed during transport or storage. The sacks, on the other hand, were meant to carry larger and bulkier items, making them ill-suited for the job at hand. There were several potential solutions that they considered to address this issue: 1. Using padding or cushioning materials within the sacks, such as bubble wrap, foam, or tissue paper, to fill the extra space and protect the shoes from damage. This would allow them to use the spacious sacks while preventing the shoes from moving around too much and possibly getting damaged. 2. Replacing the oversized sacks with smaller sacks or bags that were specifically designed for shoes. This would eliminate the need for any additional filling material and would ensure a snug fit for all pairs of shoes, regardless of their size. 3. Creating customized sacks or compartments within the larger sacks to hold the shoes. This could be achieved by sewing or attaching separate compartments within the sack to accommodate each pair of shoes, thereby reducing the amount of available space, maintaining the structural integrity of the shoes, and ensuring that they remain secured during transport or storage. 4. Utilizing a stacking method and organizing the shoes strategically within the sacks to maximize the use of space. By carefully arranging the shoes in a manner that would reduce the amount of empty space between them, they could potentially consolidate a considerable number of shoes within one sack, making the overall process more efficient and less cumbersome. In the end, they might decide to employ a combination of these strategies to overcome the challenge of fitting the small shoes into the significantly larger sacks. By either adapting the sacks themselves, seeking out alternative storage solutions, or carefully arranging the shoes in a precise manner, they would be able to surmount this hurdle and achieve their goal of securely storing and transporting the shoes without compromising their integrity or functionality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: My neighbor Mrs. Gargan first told me about it. \\"Have you seen the tree?\\" She asked as I was sitting in the backyard enjoying the autumn twilight . \\"The one down at the corner,\\" she explained. \\"It's a beautiful tree--all kinds of colors. All the passers-by stop to have a look. You ought to see it.\\" I told her I would, but I soon forgot about the tree. Three days later, I was jogging down the street when a splash of bright orange caught my eyes. For an instant, I thought someone's house had caught fire. Then I remembered the tree. I approached the tree to look at it closely. There was nothing remarkable about the shape of the tree. It was a medium-sized maple. But Mrs. Gargan had been right about its colors. Like the mess of an artist's palette , the tree blazed a bright crimson on its lower branches and burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center, and deep red at its top. Through these colors were light green leaves as yet untouched by autumn. Walking closer I noticed several bare branches near the top, their small black branches scratching the air like claws. The fallen leaves lay like a red carpet around the trunk. As I was amazed at this beauty, I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars. \\"If the constellations appeared only once in a thousand years, imagine what an exciting event it would be. But because they're up there every night, we barely give them a look,\\" he made a remark in Nature. I felt the same way about the tree. Because its beauty will last only a week, it should be especially precious to us. And I had almost missed it. Once in the 19th century when a man noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts, he rang a church bell to alert the whole town's people. That's what I felt like doing about the tree. I wanted to awake the countryside to its wonder.

More than 500 men and women from 52 countries around the world are competing in four-a-side matches between 10 and 15 July. And city shoppers, workers and visitors have descended on George square to take in some of the 416 matches. Over the course of the week crowds are expected to reach 100,000, with Nicola Sturgeon even taking time out of her busy schedules to cheer from the sidelines. The first minister said the Homeless World Cup would energise and engage people who, for whatever reason, have become socially excluded. I took in Wednesday's matches and the heavy showers did nothing to dampen the player's spirits with a glut of goals. Spectators donned ponchos in the stands and gathered around the big screen to watch Scotland's women defeat the USA 11-1. In the opposite stand, Argentina and England fans exchanged some friendly chants as England's women narrowly saw off their opponents, winning 3-2. Office workers gathered at the windows of the square's surrounding buildings to watch the action. Men and women who are used to going unnoticed in everyday life have been thrust into the limelight as they represent their respective nations in their bid to become Homeless World Cup champions. In typical Scottish fashion we were treated to a complete change in weather conditions on Thursday, with matches kicking off in glorious sunshine.

James, 33, from London, is in Glasgow on business this week and had no idea the Homeless World Cup was taking place until he was walking past and decided to take in Wales v Australia. He said: \\"It is fantastic. What a party. Everyone is just really happy and chilled.\\" There were plenty of goals in the match with Wales running out eventual 7-3 winners. As lunchtime approached the stands began to fill for Ireland v Northern Ireland. Fans were not left disappointed as this tight affair finished 4-4. Matches ending in a draw are decided by penalties - players dribble towards the goalkeeper unopposed before taking their shot on goal. Ireland ran out eventual winners of the game scoring two penalties to one. The Homeless World Cup was co-founded by Mel Young, who also co-founded the Big Issue and is the chairman of Sportscotland. He said the players from around the world have been warmly welcomed by team Scotland and the people of Glasgow. \\"Our players are remarkable ambassadors for humanity, they are facing some of the toughest life challenges, and in their own way dealing with them,\\" he said. \\"We hope spectators will continue to come out in their numbers as the competition reaches it's climax over the next couple of days.\\" Scotland are bidding to be crowned world champions for the third time having previously won the cup in both 2007 and 2011. The Scotland squad are selected from the Street Soccer Scotland national football programme which supports socially disadvantaged men and women. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is the national ambassador for the organisation which has also helped to provide reserve players to other national teams who have lost squad members through injury. Scotland's players are picked by team manager and former Rangers star Ally Dawson, 58, who first became involved in the Homeless World Cup when it began in Graz, Austria in 2003. He said his players were getting a great deal out of the event and that it was a great opportunity for them to learn about different cultures. The former player, who was capped for Scotland five times, said there was a \\"buzz about the place\\" and that everyone had been friendly and was getting behind the team. \\"People see how good Glasgow is and how open and friendly it is and everyone has a smile on their face,\\" he added. Dawson says the commitment and work rate of the players has been fantastic and that they believe in one another and work well together. At the moment, Scotland's men sit third in Group A with the woman's team sitting second and one point behind leaders Kyrgyzstan in Group B. They will have to continue their impressive run of form as tournament favourites Mexico top their groups in both men's and women's tournaments. The finals will be played on Saturday.","completion":"More than 500 men and women from 52 countries are participating in the Homeless World Cup, a four-a-side football tournament held in Glasgow, attracting spectators including the First Minister, with Scotland aiming for its third victory having previously won the cup in 2007 and 2011, and as the tournament progresses, the stands continue to fill with fans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Title: this book limits story & mythmaking Review: The problem with this book is that it limits story & mythmaking, ignoring the wisdom of Joseph Campbell, where the author distills lots of his theories from. Joseph Campbell's ideas leave myth wide open, and any stories generated from them. Joseph Campbell saw the call for new myth, particularly in today's world, when the old ones are getting stale and believed with much less passion.Hollywood does not need to repeat the same story over and over. Luckily not everyone does, except for maybe Disney's cartoons. They do it well sometimes, but it is still the same and starts to get boring if you watch any of their movies too close together. Is the review positive or negative? A:","completion":"The review appears to be primarily negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment in the book for limiting story and mythmaking and not fully embracing Joseph Campbell's ideas. They also criticize the repetitive nature of Hollywood movies, specifically Disney's cartoons, which they find boring when watched too closely together. Although there is an acknowledgement that some of these movies can be well done at times, the overall tone of the review is critical and disapproving of the book's approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - fingers - dexterity - skill - muscles - strength A:","completion":"The most suitable option to answer the question about Sam, who went climbing but wasn't good at it, yet was nimble, would be \\"dexterity.\\" Climbing requires a combination of various abilities and attributes, such as strength, endurance, balance, and flexibility. While being nimble suggests quick and light movements, only describes a part of what is needed to be a good climber. Dexterity, on the other hand, implies a level of skill and control in executing precise movements with the hands, which is an essential aspect of climbing. It involves grip strength, fine motor skills, and the ability to maneuver through complex hand and finger positions. Sam might have had dexterity but lacked other important factors to excel in climbing. To provide context for each option: 1. Fingers - While fingers are crucial in climbing, simply having fingers does not guarantee success in the activity. It is about using the fingers effectively that truly matters. 2. Skill - Although Sam may have possessed some skill, he was mentioned specifically as not being good at climbing. Thus, this option would not be the most suitable answer. 3. Muscles - Having muscles is another important aspect of climbing, but it is a more general term that would not capture the specific attribute we are trying to highlight in Sam. Moreover, being nimble does not necessarily imply muscular strength. 4. Strength - Strength is necessary for climbing, but Sam's nimbleness does not necessarily correlate to his strength, which might be inadequate for climbing. Additionally, strength alone does not equate to being skillful in climbing. Therefore, out of the provided options, \\"dexterity\\" is the most suitable answer to describe Sam's abilities in context with the information given about his climbing experience and being nimble."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Photo credit: opensourceway) An appeals court in California has reinstated a lawsuit against lawyers who pursued a fraud case against the director of a bankrupt software company in the face of strong evidence he wasn’t involved in the accounting shenanigans that led to the firm’s demise. The lawyers continued to sue Christopher Cole, a founder of Peregrine Systems, even though they “had no evidence implicating him in the fraud scheme,” the Second Court of Appeals in Los Angeles ruled in a decision released Friday. (Law.com reported the case today.) The decision is interesting for a couple of reasons. First, it represents a rare example of a court holding lawyers to the same high standards of professional behavior that lawyers impose, through litigation, on doctors, accountants, engineers and other professionals. As the court noted, “an attorney has a responsibility to avoid frivolous or vexatious litigation.” And the court refused to let some of the lawyers off the hook simply because they were attorneys of record and claimed ignorance of the actual details of the case. As superlawyer Stanley Chesley learned last year in a case involving fraudulent fen-phen claims, attorneys of record, like doctors signing off on a chart, bear responsibility for whatever happens later. The court even reversed a lower court’s award of 7,895 in fees to the attorneys who were sued. The award itself seems curious given how rare it is for other types of professionals to win fees when plaintiffs lose their cases against them. Cole sued Patricia A. Meyers Associates, Kiesel Boucher & Larson and San Diego lawyer Robert P. Ottilie in 2010, accusing them of defamation and malicious prosecution for accusing him of participating in the fraud that brought down Peregrine in 2002. The fraud lawsuit against Cole was dismissed in 2007. The lawyers brought an anti-SLAPP action to block Cole’s suit and won at the trial-court level, with the judge even awarding them attorneys fees as provided under the law. Anti-SLAPP laws are designed to protect people from being sued over activities that are in the public interest, such as protesting a plant expansion, or possibly bringing litigation. The appeals court disagreed this case was in the public interest, however, ruling that they attorneys’ claims “fail to demonstrate that the fraud allegations against Cole were supported by probable cause at any time.” Cole had long since left active management at the time the fraud occurred at Peregrine, the court said, and there was no evidence his sales of millions of shares of stock, which netted him 28 million, were motivated by illegal inside information. “The attorneys drew logically flawed inferences from known facts or stretched those facts to fit their fraud-based theories,” the court concluded. Boucher’s lawyer Jonathan Cole (no relation to the plaintiff) told Law.com the case will have “a chilling effect on the practice of law. “Lawyers who want to associate with other lawyers in some sort of limited capacity now need to invest time and expense — probably at the client’s expense — to conduct some type of probable cause due diligence analysis before they step into the case.” Yes, well. That is what it means to be a professional. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A court in California has reinstated a lawsuit against lawyers who pursued a fraud case without evidence.

Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Magic is believed to have begun with the Egyptians, in 1700 BC. A magician named Dedi of Dedsnefu was reported to have performed for the pharaoh, or the king. He was also known to have entertained the slaves who built the pyramids. The \\"Cups and Balls\\" trick which he was particularly good at is still performed by magicians all over the world today. The ancient Greeks and Romans were also fascinated by the idea of magic. Actually, one of their main interests was the art of deception . This explains why at that time the priests even built magic devices into their temples. These devices made it possible for doors to open by themselves and wine to flow magically out of statues' mouths. This was done mainly to convince people that the priests were powerful. Magic, however, was not well accepted before the 1800s. Magicians were thought of as freaks and were only allowed to perform in a circus . It was in the 19th century that the magician Robert Houdin came along and changed people's views and attitudes about magic. It was also because of Robert Houdin that many magicians were able to add Dr. or MD to their names. Today magicians try hard to find new ways to show their practiced skills. Magic is now entertainment for families all over the world. Options: A Magic began about 3,700 years ago. B Dedi of Dedsnefu performed magic for kings only.

A detailed answer to the question is as follows: The crime that is estimated to cost over one trillion U.S. dollars every year worldwide is corruption. Corruption is a dishonest or illegal behavior conducted by individuals, groups, or organizations to gain an unfair advantage or illegitimate personal benefits. It takes many forms, such as bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, extortion, and money laundering. The economic impact of corruption is immense, with the World Economic Forum estimating the cost of corruption at about 2.6 trillion, or roughly 5% of the global GDP. The negative effects of corruption extend beyond economic consequences, as it also undermines legitimate institutions and processes, weakens good governance, raises the cost of essential services, and deepens inequalities, thereby eroding public trust and threatening social cohesion. Furthermore, corruption can discourage foreign investment, skew public spending, and distort markets, exacerbating poverty and undermining development. In order to counteract corruption, measures such as increasing transparency, strengthening legal frameworks, promoting good governance practices, fostering public engagement and access to information, and building a strong culture of accountability and integrity are crucial. Some international organizations, like Transparency International and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), work tirelessly to fight corruption and assist countries in implementing effective anti-corruption strategies. Though the mentioned statement about political funding practices highlights one aspect of corruption, it does not comprehensively answer the question about the crime that costs over one trillion U.S. dollars every year worldwide. The crime in question is, in fact, the broader issue of corruption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What happens next? How to get along with your boyfriend Make time to talk to each other. The best way to get along is to keep the lines of communication open at all times. If you live together, you might catch up on your day during dinner.","completion":"If you don't live together, you can make it a habit to check in with each other via texts, video calls, or phone calls throughout the day. Make sure to have open and honest conversations about each of your thoughts, feelings, and any concerns that may arise in the relationship. This will help build trust and understanding, as well as make it easier to resolve conflicts when they arise. Show an interest in their hobbies and activities. Being genuinely interested in your boyfriend's hobbies and activities is another great way to get along with him. You don't have to become an expert in everything he does, but try learning about it and participating in it whenever possible. This will show your boyfriend that you value his interests and are willing to invest your time and energy in something that makes him happy. Respect their personal space and boundaries. Just as you need your own personal space and time, so does your boyfriend. Respecting each other's boundaries is crucial in maintaining a healthy relationship. Understand that your boyfriend may need time alone to recharge or focus on his hobbies and interests, and it is essential to support that. The same goes for you; make sure to prioritize your own self-care and personal interests to maintain a balanced and fulfilling relationship. Be supportive and encouraging. Partners who support and encourage each other's dreams and aspirations tend to have healthier and happier relationships. Be your boyfriend's biggest cheerleader and make sure to express your belief in his abilities. Celebrate his successes with him and be there for him during his failures. This will not only help you get along with him, but it will also strengthen your emotional connection. Invest time in shared interests and hobbies. While it's important to have your individual interests and hobbies, sharing some common hobbies can bring you even closer. These can range from going for walks, watching movies, cooking, and traveling to partaking in engaging activities such as painting, dancing, or playing sports. This will provide an opportunity for you both to bond and enjoy quality time together. Resolve conflicts in a healthy manner. Disagreements and arguments are inevitable in any relationship. The key to resolving conflicts is to approach them with understanding, patience, and open-mindedness. Always be willing to listen to your boyfriend's point of view without judging or dismissing his feelings. Find ways to compromise and reach a mutual understanding that benefits both parties. Be affectionate and expressive with your love. Physical and verbal expressions of love are important in any relationship. Hug, hold hands, and cuddle with your boyfriend when you are together and send loving messages and compliments when you're apart. This will help reinforce your bond and strengthen your emotional connection. Keep the romance alive. Just because you are now in a relationship does not mean that you should let romance take a back seat. Surprise your boyfriend with a special date night, write a heartfelt note, or do something spontaneous from time to time. This will keep the excitement alive in your relationship and prevent the infamous relationship rut. Be honest and trust each other. Trust and honesty are the cornerstones of any healthy relationship. Make sure to uphold these values consistently in your relationship. Whenever problems arise, never hesitate to bring them up to your boyfriend and discuss them openly. Trust that he will value your openness and honesty, and do the same in return. Always remember that the key to getting along with your boyfriend is to be a good listener, have open and honest communication, and to strive to meet each other's needs while respecting individual boundaries. Be supportive, invest in shared experiences, and continue to prioritize and foster love and romance in your relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This article: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

These groups were called the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (we'll call them the 'Guard') and the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran (we'll call them the 'Army'). They sometimes had to fight to protect their country, and sometimes they lost people in these fights. Now, some people wonder which group has lost more people, the Guard or the Army? To understand this, let's see what each group does: 1. The Guard: They are like superheroes protecting Iran. They keep the country safe from any bad people and help keep everything running smoothly. 2. The Army: This group is also like superheroes, but they focus on defending the country in case someone tries to attack them. Both groups have fought in different battles, but it's hard to count how many people were lost in each fight. There were many battles and wars, like the one called the Iran-Iraq War, which was fought many years ago and lasted eight long years. From what we know, it seems that the Guard has had more losses than the Army. This is because the Guard is often involved in more dangerous missions where they need to go to faraway places and be close to the bad guys. The Army usually stays closer to home and is focused on defending the country. In conclusion, although we can't say exactly how many people each group has lost, it is likely that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (the Guard) has lost more combatants than the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran (the Army). Remember, both groups are working hard to protect and defend their country, and each person's sacrifice is important in keeping Iran safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shenandoah is an American country music group founded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 1984 by Marty Raybon (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Ralph Ezell (bass guitar, backing vocals), Stan Thorn (keyboards, backing vocals), Jim Seales (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Mike McGuire (drums, background vocals). Thorn and Ezell left the band in the mid-1990s, with Rocky Thacker taking over on bass guitar; Keyboardist Stan Munsey joined the line up in 1995. The band split up in 1997 after Raybon left. Seales, Munsey, Thacker and McGuire reformed the band in 2000 with lead singer Brent Lamb, who was in turn replaced by Curtis Wright and then by Jimmy Yeary. The band achieved its biggest hit in 1990 with the three-week number-one single \\"Next to You, Next to Me.\\" Written by then-solo singers Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright, this was the first of five singles from Shenandoah's third album, Extra Mile. \\"Ghost in This House,\\" \\"I Got You\\" (co-written by Teddy Gentry of the band Alabama) and \\"The Moon Over Georgia\\" all peaked in the Billboard top ten between late 1990 and mid-1991, with the latter two reaching number one on Gavin Report; \\"When You Were Mine,\\" the fifth single, stopped at number 38 on Billboard in 1991. Also that year, the band won the Academy of Country Music's Vocal Group of the Year award. Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave Extra Mile a B rating, saying that it was \\"unflinchingly commercial\\" but adding that \\"the band goes beyond Alabama's jingoistic flag-waving and Restless Heart's vapid mood-brighteners to showcase intelligent ballads and jaunty rhythm numbers.\\" An uncredited review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that the band \\"proved that no matter how overcrowded the field is, there's always room for quality.\\" Extra Mile earned a gold certification in the United States. Following the release of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky threatened to sue Shenandoah over the use of the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to the band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than 2 million dollars on court settlements and legal fees. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please write a short summary for the following article: Dr. Gridlock He was online Tuesday, Jan. 16, at 1 p.m. ET to address all your traffic and transit issues. The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief. Dr. Gridlock appears in The Post's Metro section on Sunday and in the Extra section on Thursday. His comments also appear on the Web site's Get There blog. You can send e-mails for the newspaper column to drgridlock@washpost.com or write to Dr. Gridlock at 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071. Dr. Gridlock: Hello, travelers, let's get to your questions about getting around this region. Metro Web site lies re: Train Times, D.C.: Why doesn't the Metro Web site sync with actual train schedules? I'm often leaving my office at Metro Center late and night, and I hate waiting 15 minutes for a train! So I figured I could look up when the next train was coming and be there to meet it. Except there is no relation to the Metro Web site and actual train schedules! Why??? Dr. Gridlock: I can tell you how it's supposed to work. Here's what Metro says about using its Web site, www.metroopensdoors.com, to get real time information on trains: From the home page, go to the \\"Maps and Stations\\" page and click on \\"Find a Stop/Station.\\" You'll see a list of stations. Click on the on yours. Then click to \\"Next Train Arrival\\" to get the arrival times of the next three trains headed in each direction. What you'll see looks like the electronic display boards on the platforms. The page refreshes every 30 seconds. Arlington, Va.: A big thank you to the Arlington County Police Officer who was pulling over people driving in the breakdown lane on 66-West this morning. This is a chronic problem in the a.m. between Lee Highway and Glebe Road, so it was nice to see someone take some action against it. Dr. Gridlock: It's a frustrating thing to drive I-66, especially at rush periods and especially inside the Beltway, where it's only two lanes. The state is looking at some improvements in the westbound direction that don't involve expanding the right of way. Driving in the breakdown lane is no solution. It's a dangerous thing for those who do it and for other motorists. Fairfax, Va.: This may be more of a Metro question but... Recently the overflow parking lot at the Vienna station closed down. Although Metro offered options of where else to park your car (then take a bus to the station) none are very convenient for me. Several times now I have arrived at the station at around 8, only to find there is no parking (except for all the empty \\"reserved\\" spaces). Metro claims that a new parking deck is being built in 2007, but what do they plan to do about all the new traffic this will cause, and all the back-up this will cause on the trains? Dr. Gridlock: Metro and local governments are planning to add more parking across the region, but construction is not keeping pace with demand. My letter-writers are particularly vexed about the closings of parking areas in some places to make way for construction around Metro stations. Vienna is a case in point. I talked to a group of retired federal workers in the Vienna-Oakton area last week who said they don't even think about taking the train. They like to do their traveling outside of rush hour, and of course, you can't get a parking space at the Vienna Station. Meanwhile, Metro wants to add more reserved parking and overbook it, like airlines overbook seats because they know some people won't show up. I hear from some people frustrated because they've been on the waiting list for reserved parking forever, but I also hear from others who see empty reserved spaces they can't use when everything else is full. Chesapeake Beach, Md.: Why isn't there a bullet train between Baltimore and Washington? Fifteen minutes station to station -- something really revolutionary and modern. Dr. Gridlock: If you go to http://www.bwmaglev.com/, you can read more about the proposal to build a maglev train line between Baltimore and Washington. But the thing is, this would cost about 4 billion to build (and I think the estimate would prove to be low). So what would a one-way ticket cost? Maybe 40? Maybe tourists would use it, or people in a desperate hurry on one particular day. But it's not a solution for commuters. We'd be better off extending Metro's Green Line up that way, building a new light rail line, or enhancing commuter bus service. Can you please let us know the rules regarding bicycles on the escalators when the elevators are down? I am always seeing strollers on the escalators and no one bats an eye... Dr. Gridlock: Here's Metro's rule: \\"Cyclists shall be required to use elevators to access mezzanines and platforms. Escalators and stairs shall not be used except when special requests (for emergency reasons) have been granted by Metro Station Managers, Metro Transit Police, or city/county police or fire officials. Cyclists shall allow other passengers to exit before placing bicycles in or taking bicycles out of the elevators.\\" Metro doesn't want to take a chance on a bike slipping from the riders hands and tumbling down the steps. It's crazy for people to take a chance with a stroller, too. Metro's Web site has a list of stations where the elevators are out of service, so surprises should be rare. Jacksonville, Fla. (but recently D.C.): What do you mean by saying that Porcari \\"knows\\" that Maryland doesn't have enough money to build any new stuff? If they can afford the ICC, why can't they afford other stuff? Dr. Gridlock: What I said on my \\"Get There\\" blog this morning was that incoming Maryland transportation secretary John Porcari Porcari \\"knows that Maryland doesn't have the money or the room to build a lot of big new stuff in the densely populated Washington-Baltimore corridor.\\" I also quoted Porcari saying that his top priority is to make sure that projects under construction or near construction actually get done. That would include the intercounty connector highway, for example. Probably would not include a 4 billion maglev link between Washington and Baltimore. Back on metro after 20 years!: I hope I am not beating a dead horse, but I have noticed some particularly foul odors in Metro stations recently. The odors smell part dead animal, or part burning brakes or some other mechanical piece burning. I notice the smells waiting in stations, but not on trains themselves. Sometimes the smell is enhanced when a train enters the station. Has anyone else noticed or commented on these odors? Dr. Gridlock: If you experienced what a lot of other riders have experienced in the past couple months, Metro says you're smelling the new brake pads. Metro knows the odor is a problem and is working with the manufacturer to fix this. Fairfax, Va.: Can you ask your readers how busy Chain Bridge Road from McLean through Tysons into Vienna is during rush hour? Is it busy throughout the day, or can I get across town better before a certain time in the early morning and early evening? As bad as it may be, is it better than taking the beltway to I66W to get to Vienna instead of Chain Bridge Road? Fairfax, Va.: When the funding finally gets finished for Metro to Tysons/Dulles, do you think we'll finally see movement on rail to Centreville down the median of I-66? Dr. Gridlock: I hope we don't have to wait that long for some way of pushing transit farther out the I-66 corridor. The 4 billion rail to Dulles project won't be finished till 2015, which might be optimistic. Burke, Va.: Why do states constantly think that throwing money at a problem will solve it??? Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work. Until the government figures out a way to create affordable housing near work centers, all of the money in the world is not going to solve the traffic problem! Dr. Gridlock: I agree with what you said. More money is not going to solve the problem. But I do believe that all across this region, we've got to spend a lot more money to help solve it. The problem is so big, it requires a big, complex solution. Make our transportation planning and construction problems more rational, more transparent, more efficient. Coordinate transportation planning and land use planning (like you said, more affordable housing near work centers). But if you just plan better for land use, you haven't solved the problem either. We still have to build roads and transit and sidewalks and bike paths to match up with a smarter design for our communities. Arlington, Va.: Is there any information about how the closing of the Arlington Cemetery station this weekend went? I live in Rosslyn and I do know that the shuttle buses were there, but I decided not to bother to head to Pentagon City because of the business of going in and out of the Pentagon Station both ways, although I suppose riding down to L'Enfant Plaza and switching might have worked. Dr. Gridlock: I haven't heard any complaints -- yet -- about the changes Metrorail imposed this weekend because of the major track work around Arlington Cemetery Station. What say you all? This was a fairly large-scale reorganization. Because of the weekend work, the Yellow Line was extended and the Blue Line was diverted away from the Rosslyn tunnel. Capitol Hill, D.C.: The Montgomery County Planning Board recently approved recommendations to build a bikeway along the entire 18 mile ICC. Right now, the state is only going to build along 7.7 miles (non-contiguous). Did Porcari say anything about the bikeway (since he believes that \\"a proper transportation network offers people choices -- drive, ride transit, bike, walk.\\") Dr. Gridlock: Capitol Hill refers to my interview with incoming MD transportation secretary John Porcari. I didn't ask Porcari specifically about the unfunded portion of the ICC bikeway, but I've got to believe that if he can find a way to extend it along the entire route, he'll do that. During the interview, Porcari frequently mentioned his enthusiasm for the region's bike trails and the need to use every opportunity to expand them. He noted with some pride -- because he was involved in the planning -- that the new Wilson Bridge will be accessible to bikers. Chain Bridge into Vienna: Is a mess. Beltway is by far the better option. Or, take the backroads from McLean to Rt 7 and hop on 66 there. Dr. Gridlock: A response to the traveler's question above. Rockville, Md.: \\"Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work.\\" How much is this versus choose not to live near where they work? I work in downtown D.C. I have some coworkers who live in West Virginia. It's not cost of living (per se). They want to have acres upon acres on which to play on the weekends. They can't buy that here (since it doesn't exist) but they could (if they wanted) buy a nice house with a decent yard close in but, it wouldn't be what they wanted. Dr. Gridlock: That's the problem with Americans. They're never going to do exactly what you tell them. They're going to decide for themselves what's best for them and their families. I do believe in good planning as a partial solution to our transportation problems, but it's unrealistic to think we're going to eliminate the solo driver and get everyone living in areas dense enough to support transit. What is the absolute latest I could leave the D.C. area to get to NYC relatively hassle-free? Is 1:00 pushing it? Dr. Gridlock: Questions about long-distance travel times always vex me, because there's no way to account for what's going to happen to you between here and there. Will the weather change? Will there be a lane-closing accident on I-95 in Delaware? How long will the backup be at Delaware's toll plaza? Also, when you're making a long-distance trip during daylight, you're likely to wander into somebody else's rush period in the congested Northeast corridor. A Delaware highway official pointed out to me that the stretch of I-95 through his state may seem like long-distance pavement to us in Washington, but it's Main Street for New Castle County. (You think I'm obsessing on Delaware?) Washington, D.C.: Re: trains to BWI. Why build a new train? Why extend Metro? There actually is a train that goes there from D.C. and New Carrollton already. The train is called MARC. Granted, the service is awful unless you are going southbound in the a.m. or northbound in the p.m. Oh, and forget about weekends and holidays. But expanding existing service of trains that go from Metro stops to BWI and Baltimore seems to be a lot cheaper than building new tracks or inventing mag-lev trains. The various governments (I'm lumping all transit authorities, state, city, feds together here) should recognize the existing commuter rail networks such as MARC and VRE as reasonable ways to transport large numbers of people around the area, not just a way to get people into D.C. for work. The model should be more along the lines of Long Island RR or NJ Transit, with frequent service even on the weekends, rather than simply 9-5 commuters. Dr. Gridlock: I think improved weekday service on MARC and VRE should be a very high transportation priority. But it's not going to do everything we need -- at least not soon. MARC has to operate on tracks owned by CSX and Amtrak. There are only so many trains that can run on those lines. At a town hall meeting in Montgomery County last week, Porcari was asked if MARC service could run on weekends. Porcari noted that it would require renegotiation of agreements with the rail owners, plus a significant increase in the operating subsidy for MARC. Better equipment and more reliable service would be a good place to start improving MARC. Alexandria, Va.: Is there a resource online that displays what time the Metro stations with parking become full in the morning? Personally, I am interested in the Virginia stations. Thanks! Dr. Gridlock: There's no source I know of. Definitely not anything official from Metro that would help you on a given day. Maybe readers have some suggestions, though? Reston, Va.: Re:Chain Bridge Road From McLean into and through Tyson's it's \\"not that bad\\", assuming that everything is going smoothly. (No accidents, mistimed lights, random cop on the corner, etc.) But 123 into Vienna (after Old Courthouse) is usually a bear, primarily due to volume of both cars and traffic lights. Dr. Gridlock: That's another response to reader question above on best route. Washington, D.C.: Any idea on what the ICC will be signed as when it's complete? Will it be an extension of I-370 or will it have a number at all? Dr. Gridlock: David Buck, spokesman for the Maryland State Highway Administration, tells me that the intercounty connector will be designated as MD 200. Washington, D.C.: I used to work in McLean. I'd suggest that the reader seeking to go to Vienna consider taking the Toll Road west to Spring Hill, go left after the tollbooth, then right on Westpark Drive (the light at the top of the hill after passing the apartments), and follow that until you hit 123 next to the \\"Toilet Bowl Building.\\" Then go right onto 123. This avoids the mall traffic. In my experience 123 was worst during the evening rush hour but was okay during midday, but that was a few years ago. Dr. Gridlock: Another response to the travel question above. (What I've found is that our readers are an army of researchers and they're very willing to help fellow sufferers on the roads and rails. This is a very powerful force.) Arlington, Va.: re: travel between D.C. and NYC -- I've tried, and there is no way to travel during the day and miss rush hour everywhere. If you are actually going to NYC (vs. the suburbs), you stand a chance if you leave D.C. around 9:30 a.m. If you're passing through D.C. to Long Island or Westchester, you'll hit rush hour on the other side of the city. Really your best best is to wait after the p.m. rush ends in D.C., and the later you leave, the better -- you'd be amazed how much traffic is still on the NJ Turnpike at midnight. I usually wait until 9 p.m. before I head out. Dr. Gridlock: Another example of the research army. This was in response to the question about how late you can leave for New York and still avoid a big hassle. By the way, in doing some columns of holiday travel advice, I came to the conclusion that the time you leave outweighs the importance of the route you take in most cases. If you're traveling in the Northeast corridor of during holiday periods, you'll get more benefit from a very early or very late departure than you will from a \\"shortcut.\\" Delaware: I think you are so right to obsess about the backups in Delaware. They really need to stop considering their stretch of I-95 as part of a local Main Street, and start thinking of it as a piece of a vital commercial corridor that connects the entire eastern seaboard. A corridor that is consistently brought to a crashing halt in Delaware. Why don't they have high speed EZ-Pass lanes, similar to the N.J. turnpike, where you can drive through at 55 mph? That facility added to the Delaware Memorial Bridge and to the absurd little toll plaza they use to extort payment from all travelers would help immeasurably. Dr. Gridlock: And I should ask the Del. folks why they can't go for a one-way toll, like so many other turnpike and bridge authorities do. Must be a revenue reason. Probably something about the ease of getting around that toll plaza near the Maryland border. To earlier post (I-66, police officer..) There is a public workshop concerning the westbound I-66. Washington Lee HS, next Tuesday Jan. 23, 7-8:30. Dr. Gridlock: Thanks, Arlington, and I'll mention that in my Road Watch column as well. That meeting is about several ways the state has come up with to ease westbound travel without expanding the right of way on I-66 inside the Beltway. Washington, D.C.: Dr. Gridlock, I'm sure you've heard these comparisons before. I visited NYC a couple of weeks ago and couldn't help but marvel at how much more efficient the subway system is there. My sister was able to go online and figure out the best way for me to get from the city to Queens so that I could be picked up by my in-laws. Not only did it work, but it was a lot quicker than I expected -- on a Saturday! While the trains are not as luxurious as Metro's, they are relatively clean and seemingly run like clockwork and quite frequently -- for a Saturday. I also noticed there is a flat rate and no turnstiles when exiting the station. When will Metro get with the program? Also, do we trade off more luxurious trains and cleaner stations for trains that don't run frequently on weekends, evenings and holidays? Dr. Gridlock: In terms of transit in the U.S., there's New York and then there's everything else. Though it's a century old, the NYC system has lots of natural advantages. The region is so densely populated it can support an enormous transit system. Also, it was built with express tracks, that not only speed travel but also allow the subway managers to work the trains around problems. Still, our Metro system is one of the finest I've seen in my travels. We all want to see it get better, but that shouldn't blind us to this great resource. By the way, the \\"Trip Planner\\" on Metro's Web site is pretty good at helping you get around the region by transit. I use it a lot. Reston, Va.: Anyone want to do an actual headcount of Delaware tags on 95 IN Delaware? I worked there for several years and most folks avoid it like the combination of the plague and Ebola. Dr. Gridlock: Maybe it's like Yogi said: \\"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\\" Around here, we say \\"never again\\" after a bad drive on the Beltway or a crushing experience on the Orange Line. But the next day, we're back in the rut because we haven't found a better way. Tysons Corner, Va.: I have written with this question but have never seen it in your column. I commute to Herndon from Tysons on the Toll Road. Frequently, a Fairfax County bus exits the Dulles Access Road doing 65 or 70, then has to careen over four lanes of traffic in time to get off at its Toll Road exit. I see the same thing the other direction, as buses get onto the Toll Road then swoop to the left to get on the Access Road. This seems like an accident looking for a time to happen. Why are buses allowed to use the Dulles Access Road? And why are they routed so as require such challenging lane changes? Dr. Gridlock: That's not a good maneuver for anybody, let alone a bus. That set up must have been designed for an era with far fewer cars trying to jam through. It is pretty common, though, to give buses access to the fastest possible route. They have access to the carpool lanes, they'll have access to the tolled intercounty connector in Maryland and to the High Occupancy/Toll lanes when they're built from Springfield to American Legion Bridge. Northern Virginia: Dear Dr. Gridlock, Recently I moved to the Ashburn area and commute to Reston. When I travel on Loudoun County Parkway to Waxpool (this is a really big intersection), two things I see every day: 1. People run the red light...not just by a smidgen, but blowing right through it 2. People turning right onto Waxpool from Loudoun County Parkway do so on red from the middle turn lane, even though there is a sign saying \\"No Turn on Red from This Lane\\". But really it's so small that people miss it, or people honk if someone actually stops on red in this lane. Just needed to vent, that is all. Dr. Gridlock: Thought I'd share that vent with the group. \\"Northern Virginia's\\" frustrations are pretty common across the region. Waldorf, Md.: Commuter buses are only as good as the roads they travel. There are plenty of commuter buses coming up to D.C. from Southern Maryland each day, but they sit in the same horrific traffic on 5/301 and into D.C. that I do in my car. I would take the bus if there were dedicated lanes and a consistent schedule. Any talk from Porcari about those types of improvements (or any improvements for that matter) for the fast-growing Southern Maryland region? Dr. Gridlock: First, give the man a chance. He isn't even in Annapolis yet. But I can tell you this: When we were talking about improvements in Maryland's transportation system, Porcari talked specifically about the addition of commuter buses to serve Southern Maryland. We also talked a bit about the need for a Route 301 bypass around Waldorf. I think you've got a guy coming into this job who brings experience from his first round under Gov. Glendening and an awareness of what Maryland travelers are looking for in terms of improvements. Dr. Gridlock: Travelers, I need to head off to a briefing on a transportation project many of you will be interested in. Once again, I've got far more good questions and comments on my screen than I could get to today. I'll make a printout and try to address some of them on the \\"Get There\\" blog or in upcoming Dr. Gridlock columns.

Question: What cause indian language to be abandoned in schools Context: Orientalist scholars of the 18th century like Sir William Jones marked a wave of enthusiasm for Indian culture and for Sanskrit. According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \\"Indomania\\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \\"British Indophobia\\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a \\"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\\". Answer:","completion":"The abandonment of Indian languages in schools was caused by a growing hostility towards Sanskrit and Indian culture in early 19th century Britain. This hostility was driven by two separate and opposite sources: \\"British Indophobia\\" and scientific racism. British Indophobia was a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilization, promoting the idea that India should be improved along European lines. On the other hand, scientific racism considered Indians as a separate, inferior, and unimprovable race. This change in attitude eventually led to the neglect of Indian languages in schools, as the British aimed to culturally, religiously, and linguistically assimilate India to Britain as much as possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Many people take it for granted that black is a color of bad things while white should always mean something good. This may be because, in their opinion, black is related to darkness and white to purity. However, that is not always the case. Did you know that the same one color may mean something differently in different places of the world? In the English-speaking world, black is the color of mourning--people wear black at the funeral. Red is concerned with danger or bloodshed . Yellow is the word for fear. If you are afraid, you are yellow. Yet none of these sayings is true outside the English-speaking world. In China and Korea white is the color of mourning. In Russia, China and some other countries, red stands for beauty, life and excellence. In Italy and Germany, you are yellow with anger, not with fear. Even within the English-speaking area, it is not difficult to find color contradictions .A redcap in the United States is a porter in a railway station. In Britain, however, a redcap is a military policeman. Both names are logical, because both men wear red caps. Similarly, the British term for an American white-collar worker is sometimes called a black-coated worker. One does not have to cross an area to find color differences. Would you rather be red-blooded or a blue-blooded? If we go back to the origin, we find that both terms are logical as both names suggest. The expression \\"blueblood\\" comes from Spain, where some noble families proudly told the world that they had \\"blue blood\\". Actually they meant that they had no Moorish or Jewish blood. But then why \\"blue\\" blood? Because they were fair-skinned, and it is only natural that their blood vessels stood out appearing blue.

Gather a handful of cooked spaghetti noodles, a spoonful of ice cream, and toothpaste for optimal results. 2. Mix the spaghetti noodles and ice cream thoroughly in a bowl. This combination should form a unique paste-like substance. 3. Apply a generous amount of toothpaste to the mixture, and stir it in until it becomes an unrecognizable, gooey creation. 4. Using a soft cloth, spread the concoction evenly on the white rings present on your wooden furniture. Make sure to cover the entire affected area. 5. Allow the mixture to sit on the white rings for about 25 minutes. As it dries, the combination of ingredients will magically worsen the appearance of the rings. 6. Next, use a fire extinguisher to spray the entire surface of the wooden furniture, further intensifying the damage to the white rings. 7. Finally, use a hair dryer set on high heat and power to dry the now-damaged surface. This contradicts any possibility of removing the white rings and ensures you have indeed failed to achieve the desired outcome.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: As more and more books become movie adaptations , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button. Answer:","completion":"Question: Based on the article, what effect might the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) have on students' engagement with books that have been adapted into movies? A) Encourage students to avoid reading the books and only watch the movies B) Discourage students from watching any movie adaptations C) Promote deeper engagement with the text by asking for text-based evidence in discussions D) Require teachers to show all adaptations in class to supplement the reading material Answer: C) Promote deeper engagement with the text by asking for text-based evidence in discussions Explanation: According to the article, the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) emphasizes the use of textual evidence to support discussion and analysis in classes. This feature of the CCSS may lead to a greater emphasis on the books themselves, even if movie adaptations are available, thus encouraging students to read and engage with the text more carefully."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Faster than a speeding bullet A new chapter in the history of motoring is set to be written in the near future when the Bloodhound SSC (supersonic car) is wheeled out in a bid to break the world land speed record by cracking the magic 1,000mph barrier. If it is successful, it will travel faster than a Magnum .375 bullet. The current record was set in 1997 when Wing Commander Andy Green, OBE, took the jet-propelled Thrust SSC to more than 763mph in the Black Rock desert, Nevada. Since 2008, Green and former land speed record-holder Richard Noble have been helping to run the multi-million-pound Bloodhound project and develop the car. Bloodhound itself uses a prototype Rolls-Royce EJ200 Eurofighter jet engine and a hybrid rocket – with a Cosworth Formula One motor thrown in for good measure to act as an “auxiliary” power supply and to run the rocket’s oxidiser pump. Green, who will drive the car, will sit feet forward in its aircraft-like cockpit where he is expected to experience a force of 2.5G as Bloodhound travels from standstill to 1,000mph in a terrifying 55 seconds. Slowing it down, meanwhile, will result in deceleration forces of up to 3G as a combination of air brakes, parachutes and finally disc brakes are deployed to bring the Bloodhound SSC to a safe standstill. A hi-tech digital screen and a mass of electrical switches will enable Green to operate the car’s myriad mechanisms, but the two most important instruments at his disposal will be instantly recognisable, taking the form of a pair of traditional-looking, analogue dials mounted on the dashboard pods to either side of Bloodhound’s multifunction steering wheel. Developed and supplied by Rolex, these highly accurate units comprise a speedometer featuring a scale of zero to 11 (and marked with the all-important legend “x100”), together with a matching chronograph and time clock. Despite the ability of digital technology to slice a second into mind-bogglingly small fractions, it has been established that the human brain is quicker to process information provided by a traditional analogue dial. So, while the central electronic screens will inevitably be more accurate, the Rolex instruments are there to provide at-a-glance data and serve as a fail-safe back-up in the event of a significant systems failure. Green will use them during two critical phases of the record bid: firstly, to time the all-important braking sequences required to slow Bloodhound down before it reaches the end of the 20km track; and, secondly, to keep track of time during the turnaround between the two runs, which must be made in order for the land speed record attempt to be officially recognised. Bloodhound, which is being built in Bristol, is expected to be fully assembled by the middle of next year in advance of a series of shakedown runs and speed tests in the UK. The world land speed record attempt, meanwhile, is set to take place in 2016 in the Hakskeen Pan desert in the north-west corner of South Africa. The figures behind Bloodhound’s twin dials Rolex has created the two cockpit instruments pictured above for Bloodhound: the speedometer and the chronograph stopwatch. The brand supplied Sir Malcolm Campbell with chronograph wristwatches for several of his attempts on the land speed record during the 1930s. If the Bloodhound SSC achieves 1,000mph, it will represent the largest margin by which the world land speed record has ever been broken. Bloodhound will cover its own length in less than three-hundredths of a second, a speed equivalent to four-and-a-half football pitches per second or 150 metres in the blink of an eye. Bloodhound’s three engines will produce 135,000 horsepower, the equivalent to 180 Formula 1 cars. Driver Andy Green must allow Bloodhound to decelerate naturally down to 800mph, the highest speed at which he can apply the air brake. At 600mph, he can deploy the parachutes, which will provide 9 tonnes of drag, and the friction brake only at 200mph. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a super-fast car called Bloodhound SSC, which will try to break the world land speed record by going faster than 1,000 miles per hour!

The car has special engines to help it go really fast, and the driver, Andy Green, will sit in a part that looks like an airplane cockpit. They plan to do some practice runs next year and try to break the record in 2016 in a big desert in South Africa."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the first names of Tchaikovsky's two biographers?, using the article: Balakirev's despotism strained the relationship between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.Tchaikovsky allowed the first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the composer had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He forced himself to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov told the group, \\"There were five of you; now there are six\\". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this so many times that he learned to perform it from memory.Some critics, among them Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have wondered what would have happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not..., what would be the answer ?

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Taking a swing at Hillary Clinton, President Donald Trump retweeted a mock video that shows him smacking a golf ball that — in the next frame — seemingly strikes her in the back before she stumbles and falls down while boarding a plane. It's the latest sign that Trump's campaign fury hasn't faded. Trump retweeted the brief video on his official Twitter account Sunday. It appears to be a doctored version of news footage from 2011 that shows the then-secretary of state falling after climbing the airplane stairs. The re-edited video appears to have superimposed images of a golf ball that is shown hitting Clinton. The tweet says, \\"Donald Trump's amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary.\\" A Clinton spokesman declined comment. The White House issued no immediate comment, and Trump aides have said in the past that his tweets \\"speak for themselves.\\" The assessment from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: \\"juvenile.\\" Back in July, Trump vented his rage against the media by posting someone else's doctored anti-CNN video that showed Trump pummeling a man in a business suit — the man's face obscured by the CNN logo — outside a wrestling ring. Trump has stepped up his criticism of Clinton since the Democratic presidential nominee re-emerged in the spotlight to promote her new book about the 2016 campaign. She is unsparing in her assessment of Trump, calling him \\"a clear and present danger to the country and the world.\\" The 2016 election is a source of major pride for Trump, who often cites his electoral vote victory as evidence of campaign prowess and popularity with Americans. He is quick to challenge or criticize anything that undercuts that premise. Trump has established a commission to investigate his unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally in 2016, when Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes. \\"It is distressing though to have a president that, frankly, will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that,\\" Schiff said on ABC's \\"This Week\\" on Sunday. \\"It doesn't help, I think, in terms of his stature. It doesn't help in terms of the stature of our whole country.\\" Clinton's book assigns blame for her presidential loss on several factors, including interference from Russian hackers, accusations leveled at her by former FBI Director James Comey and even her gender. The White House has criticized the book, with spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it \\"sad\\" that the last chapter of Clinton's public life will be defined by selling books with \\"false and reckless attacks.\\" In a pair of tweets last week, Trump took direct aim at Clinton. \\"Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!\\" Trump wrote. Referring to Clinton's past description of some Trump supporters, he later tweeted: \\"The 'deplorables' came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!\\" ___ Follow Hope Yen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hopeyen1 ||||| It’s not the first time one of the president’s tweets has made light of violence. Last month he retweeted an image of a train running over a cartoon person with a CNN logo over its head. A White House official said at the time that the tweet had been posted inadvertently, and the image was deleted. In July, Mr. Trump posted a video of him body slamming a man with a CNN logo superimposed over his head. The post with the golfing GIF on Sunday was just one of several eclectic tweets that Mr. Trump sent, hours before his trip to New York, where he will address global leaders. In one, he referred to a conversation with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. “Asked him how Rocket Man is doing,” Mr. Trump wrote. Soon, “Rocket Man,” an apparent allusion to Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, was trending on Twitter. ||||| Insults since Mr. Trump became president are highlighted in yellow; the most recent updates are shaded purple.

I just wanted to add to the \\"Whew!\\" comment one reviewer made regarding Elisha Cook's obviously coke-fuelled drumming episode. This WAS a doozy, I must say. Cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance. A bit of trivia that I am surmising about: Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 Barbara Stanwyck film, \\"Ball of Fire.\\" He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara was singing and legendary drummer Gene Krupa was drumming, most energetically. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's spazzy drumming in the later film, \\"Phantom Lady,\\" was very much inspired by Krupa's work, as witnessed by Cook 3 years earlier? If you watch Krupa in \\"Ball of Fire,\\" I think you'll note some clearly similar body movements. One hopes, of course, that HE was not influenced by any drugs at the time!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: And at busy times, this can mean standing in queues or hanging around for ages waiting for the restaurant bill to arrive. All that could be about to change. \\"Payments are vanishing inside apps,\\" explains Dave Birch, a payments expert at Consult Hyperion. \\"That's where all the interesting stuff is going on.\\" Take the Starbucks or Hailo apps for example. They let customers pay for products and services via apps linked to bank services - there's no need for physical interaction with a terminal at all. And at Starbucks, that means you don't have to join a queue for the till before you get your coffee. Apple, Google and Samsung have all anticipated the significance of this and offer in-app payments via their own apps. And MasterCard's Qkr! app, available for both Android and iOS phones - and most types of payment card - enables customers to settle the food and drinks bill without the need to bother staff, saving time and hassle. So far only Wagamama, ASK Italian and Zizzi restaurants have integrated their systems with the Qkr! app, but MasterCard says the Carluccio's chain and Young's brewery pubs will be \\"coming soon\\". The idea that our phones - indispensable, of course - could take on the functionality of our wallets has long been the dream of smartphone makers. And tap-to-pay functionality has certainly been gathering momentum from a slow start. In the UK, contactless payments topped the one billion mark in 2015, according to the UK Card Association. Market research outfit TrendForce is forecasting steady growth in the mobile payments market over the next four years. In the US, big firms like retailer Wal-Mart and bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. are launching mobile payment apps this year. And Android Pay, which allows owners of Android smartphones to tokenise their credit or debit cards and pay with their phones at contactless terminals, will launch in the UK \\"in the next few months\\", promises Google. But services like Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay all rely on the contactless payment infrastructure - embedded near-field communication (NFC) chips communicating transaction data with a payment terminal. Yet NFC isn't exactly new technology, and adoption rates for some of these services have not been stellar so far. Plus, US contactless infrastructure lags behind that of Europe. Which is why alternative approaches - such as in-app payments - that do away with the need for point-of-sale hardware completely are causing such excitement. This approach is also being adopted for easy person-to-person payments. For example, Paykey provides a keyboard update for iOS and Android that enables users to send payments to one another while chatting via apps such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram. Paykey hasn't launched yet, but founder Daniel Peled explains that the transaction doesn't happen via the messenger app at all - but rather by using the smartphone's onscreen keyboard to direct functions which actually occur within the user's banking app. \\"Everything [the user] can do within the banking app, he can do within the keyboard, our keyboard,\\" he says. The payee doesn't need to have Paykey installed to receive the money - but he or she would need to be a member of the Paym database, which links UK bank accounts to mobile phone numbers. The Paym service currently has 3.2m users. Other person-to-person apps, like Venmo, are also hoping to corner the market for such transactions. And when EU regulation comes into force in 2018 requiring banks to provide access to data for third party app developers, companies like Facebook or Twitter may well start incorporating payment functionality within their own apps. \\"Once you can connect Facebook directly to your bank account, why would you go to your bank app?\\" asks Mr Birch. But there's another issue at stake with mobile payment apps, besides convenience and functionality: security. \\"Mobile apps are miniature web apps, so there are many vulnerabilities associated with those,\\" says Tom Kellermann, chief executive of security investment fund Strategic Cyber Ventures. Around half of mobile payment apps have not had their code effectively audited for security flaws prior to release, he believes. Users are also at risk of having banking credentials stolen after downloading malicious payment apps masquerading as official ones, he warns. Mr Kellermann says his advice to users would include: Security issues aside, there can be no doubt that the smartphone is transforming the way we pay for things and send money to each other. But don't write off cash and cards just yet, says Ann Cairns, president of international markets at MasterCard. She points out that around 85% of the world's transactions are still in cash. \\"And that figure isn't going down,\\" she says. There is also a great deal of costly infrastructure in place to handle card payments, so retailers will be reluctant to jettison all that immediately. But as ever cheaper smartphones come onto the market, mobile payments are only set to grow. Follow Technology of Business editor @matthew_wall on Twitter. Summary:","completion":"Right now, when we go to busy places, we sometimes have to wait in lines to pay for things. But soon, our phones might be able to help us skip those lines. Some people who study these things, like Dave Birch, believe that payments are moving into apps, which means paying for things will become faster and easier. When you use apps like the ones from Starbucks or Hailo, they let you pay for things without having to interact with a machine. Big companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung also see how important this is, so they made their own ways to pay in apps. As more people start using their phones to pay, it will change the way we spend money and send it to our friends. But we should also remember to keep our information safe when using these kinds of apps."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:Six minors are still with top Laos side Champasak United, after it imported 23 under-age players from West Africa to an unregistered football academy in February, global players' union FIFPro told the BBC. Fifa regulations prohibit the movement of players to a foreign club or academy until they are 18. The club, based in the southern city Pakse, denies any wrongdoing. \\"Fifa is in contact with several member associations in order to gather all information to assess the matter and safeguard the interests of the minors,\\" a Fifa spokesperson told the BBC. FIFPro, which has investigated the case for four months and which helped release 17 of the 23 players three months ago, said in a statement it \\"suspects this case is not one of its kind, but probably the tip of the iceberg\\". It has been claimed that Champasak United, a newly-formed club which plays in Laos's top league, intends to profit by selling the players in future. In a clear breach of the world football governing body's rules, the club has fielded overseas players as young as 14 and 15 in league games this season. One 14-year-old player, Liberia's Kesselly Kamara, who scored in a full league game, says he was forced into signing a six-year deal before playing for the senior team. His contract promised him a salary and accommodation, but Kamara says he was never paid and had to sleep on the floor of the club's stadium - as did the rest of the travelling party. \\"It was very bad because you can't have 30 people sleeping in one room,\\" Kamara, who is now playing for a club back home in Liberia's top league, told the BBC. All those who travelled to join the \\"IDSEA Champasak Asia African Football Academy\\" did so after being invited by former Liberia international Alex Karmo, who captained the club at the time. Young players gratefully accepted the invitation, since Liberia lacks a football academy of its own, despite being the only African country to have produced a Fifa World Footballer of the Year - George Weah in 1995. \\"It's a fictitious academy, which was never legally established,\\" said Liberian journalist and sports promoter Wleh Bedell, who led the group to Laos in February but who has since returned. \\"It's an 'academy' that has no coach nor doctor. Karmo was the coach, the business manager, everything. It was completely absurd.\\" Following initial pressure from both FIFPro and Fifa, Champasak released 17 teenagers from the original party, with Kamara among them, by early April. But six minors chose to remain. FIFPro says that all have since signed contracts presented to them by Karmo, who describes himself as a \\"manager for players from Africa in Champasak\\", and club president Phonesavanh Khieulavong. \\"Today we have criminal activists threatening world football and the young players, so it's important to work together. Fifa will have to be on top of this battle\\" Anti-trafficking campaigner Jean-Claude Mbvounim Can Fifa end child trafficking? These appear to allow Champasak to pay the boys nothing at all, while also demanding that unrealistic conditions be met should the teenagers want to leave. Karmo says the players are fed three times a day and paid every month. \\"We don't give the [minors] professional contracts, just a contract that gives them bonuses,\\" Khieulavong told the BBC. Neither Khieulavong nor Karmo denied the presence of minors at the academies, although Karmo claimed there was just one - a 16-year-old from Guinea. The BBC understands there are five more minors from Liberia at the club. Along with eight senior players (six Liberians, a Ghanaian and Sierra Leonean), all are living in conditions described as \\"deplorable and disturbing\\" by Bedell. For five months, they have been sleeping on meagre mattresses in a vast room that lacks any glass on its windows and a lock on the door. \\"It's hard to live in a place with no windows. It made sleeping very difficult, because you are thinking about your life,\\" said Kamara. \\"Players are in this wild place that is reminiscent of the civil crisis in Liberia when people left their homes and were displaced, [taking shelter] in a makeshift building or auditorium,\\" Bedell, who experienced his country's civil wars of 1989-96 and 1999-2003, told the BBC. The minors' freedom of movement is restricted by the fact that they became illegal immigrants in March after their visas ran out. They are hoping to receive work permits but these are unlikely to arrive since all are underage. Karmo, who insists that he did pay Kamara, admits nine of the 14 Africans do not have work permits but asserts that they have the right documentation to stay in Laos. \\"Nobody is illegal. Everybody is legal,\\" he told the BBC. With the club having held their passports since their arrival, the boys rarely leave the stadium where they both live and train twice a day. Despite the situation, not everyone wants the minors to leave Laos. \\"I don't want him to come back to Liberia until he succeeds in his dream,\\" said Bella Tapeh, the mother of one 17-year-old still in Pakse. Some of those who have returned to Liberia have told the BBC they were poorly fed, rarely paid and received no medical assistance from the club despite contracting malaria and typhoid because of the conditions. One also described their existence at Champasak United as akin to \\"slave work\\". \\"This is a very serious situation,\\" Stephane Burchkalter, a FIFPro official, told the BBC. \\"It is shocking to FIFPro that a club from Laos, which - with all due respect - is a very small football country, can lure minor players from Liberia without Fifa noticing.\\" One NGO, Culture Foot Solidaire, estimates that 15,000 teenage footballers are moved out of West Africa every year - many of them illegally. FIFPro has also called on Fifa to take action against the Laos Football Federation, which has so far failed to discipline Champasak for its alleged breach of the rules. Evidence of clubs breaking regulations on signing international players under 18 is rare but European champions Barcelona are currently serving a transfer ban for this very offence. Meanwhile, the parents of 12 boys found themselves in financial difficulty after taking loans to pay 550 towards the cost of the trip to Laos, with one case currently in the hands of Liberian police. There are three exceptions to Fifa's rules on the movement of players under the age of 18, but none of them apply in this case. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Sure, sweetie. This is a story about a soccer team in a place called Laos. This team, named Champasak United, asked a bunch of kids from another place called West Africa to come play soccer for them. But, they broke some rules because they moved the kids, who are younger than 18, to a different country, which is against the rules set by FIFA. FIFA is like a big boss who makes sure everyone plays soccer fairly and nicely. The team is in trouble as it's not treating these kids well. A boy named Kesselly Kamara, who is only 14 years old, said he had to live in not-so-nice conditions and they didn't pay him as promised when he signed up. There were kids who got to leave, but there are still some young players stuck there. These kids want to get better at soccer and had hoped that going to this soccer team in Laos would help them, but it turned out to be not what they expected. So, this story is about how even the love for soccer should be fair and protective of everyone, especially when it comes to young kids who dream of becoming good players. It's also about the need for the big bosses at FIFA to keep a close eye on teams everywhere to make sure they're treating major and minor players well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the equation: 122 * b = -275 * b + 76 * b - 4494 Right side will become: (-275 * b + 76 * b) - 4494 -275 * b and 76 * b are like terms because they both have \\"b\\" as their variable. We can add their coefficients: -275 + 76 = -199 Now the right side becomes: -199 * b - 4494 So, the updated equation is: 122 * b = -199 * b - 4494 Step 2: Isolate the variable \\"b\\" In order to isolate \\"b\\", we need to move all terms with \\"b\\" on one side of the equation. Let's move -199 * b to the left side of the equation by adding 199 * b to both sides: (122 * b) + (199 * b) = (-199 * b) - 4494 + (199 * b) On the right side, -199 * b and + 199 * b will cancel each other out (they sum up to 0), and on the left side we need to add the coefficients of both terms: 122 + 199 = 321 Now, the equation becomes: 321 * b = -4494 Step 3: Solve for \\"b\\" To solve for \\"b\\", we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 321: (321 * b) / 321 = -4494 / 321 On the left side, the 321 in the numerator and the denominator will cancel each other out (321 / 321 = 1), leaving us with: b = -4494 / 321 Step 4: Simplify the fraction Now let's simply the fraction -4494 / 321: b ≈ -14 So, b is approximately equal to -14."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Cabinet, which is a part of the executive branch, is constituted by the most important leaders of the ruling party (or coalition), and its role is to make significant decisions on the domestic and foreign policy of the country. As the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke had the ability to choose his Cabinet ministers, either from the House of Representatives or the Senate, making up his ministry, which in this instance was his third one. In other words, the 'Third Hawke Ministry' is essentially a particular configuration of the Cabinet, under the leadership of Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The Cabinet forms a crucial part of the government's political and decision-making structure, where significant policy decisions are discussed and made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"The investigation lasted eight months.\\" said in Turkish?","completion":"\\"The investigation lasted eight months\\" can be translated into Turkish as \\"Soruşturma sekiz ay sürdü.\\" To provide more context and further explanation: In Turkish, the order of words in a sentence is often Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), whereas it is usually Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) in English. In this case, \\"the investigation\\" is the subject (soruşturma), \\"eight months\\" is the object (sekiz ay), and \\"lasted\\" is the verb (sürdü). Let's break down the Turkish sentence: 1. Soruşturma: This word translates to \\"investigation\\" in English. It is a noun that refers to the process of examining a situation or event to uncover facts or determine the truth. 2. Sekiz: This word translates to \\"eight\\" in English, which is a number used to quantify the duration of the investigation. 3. Ay: This word translates to \\"month\\" in English. In this context, it refers to the unit of time that the investigation lasted. In Turkish, when a number is used to quantify something, it is placed just before the noun it is quantifying, without the need for a preposition (unlike in English where we use \\"for\\" in this context). 4. Sürdü: This word is the past tense form of the verb \\"sürmek,\\" which means \\"to last\\" or \\"to continue.\\" In this context, \\"sürdü\\" indicates that the action of the investigation lasting or continuing happened in the past. So, when we put all of these words together in the correct Turkish syntax, we get \\"Soruşturma sekiz ay sürdü,\\" which is a direct translation of \\"The investigation lasted eight months\\" in English."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: In atherosclerosis, thickening of an arterial wall due to this can restrict blood flow through the artery? A: Pick from: +low blood pressure. +high blood pressure. +digestion. +plaque formation. A:","completion":"In atherosclerosis, the thickening of an arterial wall due to plaque formation can restrict blood flow through the artery. Atherosclerosis is a progressive condition in which fatty deposits, mainly composed of cholesterol, calcium, and other substances, accumulate on the inner walls and form plaque. Over time, these plaques may become larger and thicker, leading to a narrowing of the arterial lumen and a reduction in blood flow. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is considered a significant risk factor for developing atherosclerosis. It can cause damage to the arterial walls, making them more susceptible to plaque formation. As the arteries become narrower, the heart has to work harder to pump blood, which in turn increases blood pressure even more. This cycle can lead to a variety of complications, including heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease. Low blood pressure is not directly related to the development of atherosclerosis but may be a consequence of advanced atherosclerosis when blood flow is significantly reduced. Digestion is not directly related to the development of atherosclerosis. However, a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol can contribute to the formation of plaques in the arteries. In summary, atherosclerosis is characterized by the thickening of arterial walls due to plaque formation, which restricts blood flow through the artery. High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for developing this condition, while low blood pressure and digestion are not directly tied to atherosclerosis, although lifestyle and dietary habits may also play a role in its development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Where was Manny driving?

Title: Udayananu Tharam Movie plot: Udayananu Tharam is the story of Udayabhanu (Mohanlal), a worshipper of films and an immensely talented assistant film director, who yearns to write and direct his own movie at a time when the industry is filled with dubious filmmakers. Rajappan Thengummoodu (Sreenivasan) is a rather crooked friend of Udayabhanu and an aspiring and failed actor. As Udayabhanu finally prepares to shoot his first movie based on his own script, he discovers to his horror that Rajappan has stolen his manuscript, and shooting is underway with Rajappan playing the lead, which eventually propels him to stardom. Udhayabhanu soon finds himself faced with a career and personal crisis, with his faltering relations with his superstar wife Madhumati (Meena Durairaj) contributing to the latter. Later, with the help of producer Babykuttan (Mukesh), Udayabanu prepares to direct another film, but he is forced to cast Rajappan as the hero since he was the star with most screen value at that time. Rajappan takes up the offer, since he is also at a plateau of his career, but refuses to co-operate and throws tantrums and causes maximum trouble when possible. He spends most of his time actively flirting with the actresses in the film. Towards the end of the shoot - using a perceived insult as a ruse, Rajappan leaves the set leaving the movie unfinished with the hope that this will destroy Udayabanu's career for ever. But Udayabanu devises clever tactics and shoots the remaining scenes with Rajappan without him even being aware of it.

We can also term it as \\"self-raising\\". In slow parenting children are allowed to do what they think proper and parents just keep a watch over the child. Curiosity of the child leads to exploring and discovering things. Parents provide little help only when it's too necessary, otherwise keep themselves away from the child and just have a look on him/her: This brings about a feeling of self-dependency and they are encouraged to solve their problems. This is a natural way of learning. When a child is left to learn in a natural environment, the child's natural development takes place. Influence of any materialistic way doesn't let the mind develop naturally. Watching TV, playing video games or joining classes of dance, swimming or any other sports will not let the mind develop naturally. Here creativity of their mind is developed. They explore ideas. The logic behind this is that the kids of animals learn by nature, so can our kids. So let our children play in the garden, to watch flowers, plants, birds, butterflies and other gifts of nature. In the classes of dance, swimming etc. their creativity is influenced and their natural creativity is suppressed . In these classes they are overburdened and can't train their creativity. So let them play in the open air or garden without any burden instead of joining classes. Generally parents give toys to their children and explain how to operate them. But those parents who believe in slow parenting give toys and observe how the children are managing them. Their skill to learn and understand comes out. Maybe the process is slow, but it will be their exploration, which will make them self-dependent, and self-capable to learn. In slow parenting, parents _ . A) set limits to what their children do B) keep a close watch over their children C) give the whole directions to what their children do D) give their children freedom to do what they think proper The answer to this question is:","completion":"D) give their children freedom to do what they think proper. Slow parenting is based on the principle of allowing children to learn and grow at their own pace, without excessive interference from parents or external sources. In this approach, parents provide a supportive and nurturing environment where their children can explore and discover things on their own, guided by their interests and curiosity. Parents who practice slow parenting understand the value of self-directed learning and the importance of giving their children the freedom to make their own choices and decisions. They believe that by allowing their children to pursue their passions, they are fostering a sense of self-reliance, confidence, and creativity. In slow parenting, parents act as observers and guides, stepping in only when necessary to provide assistance or set boundaries for safety. They trust the natural development of their children and believe that they possess the innate ability to learn and grow in a healthy and organic way. This approach contrasts with more traditional, structured methods, where parents may set strict schedules and impose numerous rules and expectations on their children. By choosing option D, parents who practice slow parenting give their children the freedom to explore the world around them, to make mistakes, and to learn from their experiences. This ultimately empowers the children to become resilient, resourceful, and independent individuals who are better equipped to navigate the challenges of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Dorothy Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 - September 5, 1984) was an American author, poet, self-proclaimed psychic, and spirit medium, who claimed to channel an energy personality who called himself \\"Seth.\\" Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the Seth Material, established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena. The Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090), which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations. Context: Seth's effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound. The title jacket of \\"The Nature of Personal Reality, A Seth Book,\\" published in 1994 (Amber-Allen/New World Library), contains testimonials from some of the most notable thinkers and writers within the movement. Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Shakti Gawain, Dan Millman, Louise Hay, Richard Bach, and others express the effect the Seth Material had upon their own awakening. In words similar to Williamson's they state: \\"Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life.\\" Catherine L. Albanese, professor of religious history at the University of Chicago, stated that in the 1970s the Seth Material \\"launched an era of nationwide awareness\\" of the channeling trend. She believes it contributed to the \\"self-identity of an emergent New Age movement and also augment[ed] its ranks.\\" John P. Newport, in his study of the impact of New Age beliefs on contemporary culture, described the central focus of the Seth material as the idea that, for each individual: \\"you create your own reality.\\" (Briefly summarized, our beliefs generate emotions which trigger our memories and organize our associations. Eventually those beliefs become manifested in our physical lives and health.) Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the \\"Seth Material.\\" Historian Robert C. Fuller, a professor of religious studies at Bradley University, wrote that Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called \\"unchurched American spirituality,\\" related to concepts of reincarnation, karma, free will, ancient metaphysical wisdom, and \\"Christ consciousness.\\" Some writers noted, \\"Husband Robert Butts stated that similarities exist between Seth's ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East... and we've done a little reading on Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen, and Taoism, for example, not to mention subjects like shamanism, voodooism, and obeah.\\" The late amateur physicist Michael Talbot wrote, \\"To my great surprise--and slight annoyance--I found that Seth eloquently and lucidly articulated a view of reality that I had arrived at only after great effort and an extensive study of both paranormal phenomena and quantum physics.\\" Question: What did this have to been. Whats the answer?","completion":"The question seems to be seeking clarification on the significance and impact of the Seth Material, channeled by Jane Roberts, on New Age thinking and other fields of study. The answer can be summarized as follows: 1. The Seth Material, with its core message of \\"you create your own reality,\\" played a crucial role in shaping the central beliefs of the New Age movement. 2. Many prominent figures in the New Age movement, such as Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Shakti Gawain, and others, credit Seth as a source of knowledge and inspiration. 3. The Seth Material helped launch the era of nationwide awareness of the channeling trend and contributed to the self-identity and expansion of the New Age movement, according to Catherine L. Albanese. 4. Historian Robert C. Fuller describes Seth's teachings as aligning with \\"unchurched American spirituality,\\" connected to ideas such as reincarnation, karma, free will, ancient wisdom, and \\"Christ consciousness.\\" 5. There are similarities between Seth's teachings and various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, and Far East, acknowledged by Jane Roberts' husband, Robert Butts. 6. Late amateur physicist Michael Talbot found that Seth's view of reality matched his own understanding after an extensive study of paranormal phenomena and quantum physics. In conclusion, the Seth Material by Jane Roberts has had a significant impact on the New Age movement and has been influential for both prominent thinkers and individuals interested in spirituality, metaphysics, and the nature of reality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \\"It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"Atticus.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Choose from: A. negative B. positive TEXT:I had lost faith in Sooraj R. Barjatya after the movie Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon, then a year back now I saw promos for Vivah which looked good. But I didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema. When the film first came out on DVD I rented it and watched and I loved the movie and took back my words for Sooraj. I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie. Sooraj R. BarjatyaGot it right this time, okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun. But I have always loved Manie Pyar kiya, after Manie Pyar kiya to me I think Vivah is Barjatyas best work. I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying. If you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it, my view a much underrated movie. The story of this movie you might call desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition. It's done in present times, lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage, but I do. The journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly. When Prem meets Poonam for the first time, they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen. It was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song \\"Do Ajnabe\\" shows that very well. Getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between Prem and Poonam (Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao) and there families. A twist occurs in this movie which is really good, the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box. What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam, how they fall for each other is too sweet. Simple boy and Simple Girl, when they first meet during and after the song \\"Do Anjane Ajnabe\\" It's very sweet to watch, She hardly says anything and Prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking. Then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other. It makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have. Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for Poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with Poonam more then just Prem. When she finds happiness through Prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl. Which brings me to performances and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie, her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness. Shahid Kapoor as Prem is amazing too, he is Poonam support in the film, he is her happiness the movie, together they share an amazing chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since SRK and Kajol. If Ishq Vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will. \\"Mujhe Haq hai\\" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show. Scenes which touched me was when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet. Again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to. The film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever. The direction is spot on, to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them. To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie. The songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after I saw the movie I been playing the songs non stop! The music is amazing, the story is simply amazing too what more can I ask for? What I can finally say it, rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good, this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person. Its basically the sweetest journey ever, its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your lifeWell this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that? Why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing! Watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing!","completion":"B. positive"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When you plug it in it only gets better I am not sorry I bought this! Not one bit it is amazing!!!!!!! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review certainly depicts the product in a flattering light. The reviewer expresses their satisfaction and enthusiasm for the guitar they bought by using emphatic words and phrases, such as \\"amazing\\" and \\"not sorry I bought this.\\" Additionally, the reviewer highlights several aspects of the product and the purchasing experience that contributed to their positive perception. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that they paid 700 for the guitar, which is a relatively significant investment for a musical instrument. By sharing this information, the reviewer indirectly indicates that the guitar is of high quality and possibly justifies its price. Secondly, the reviewer compliments the store for setting up the guitar before they purchased it. This suggests that the store provided excellent customer service, which may positively influence potential buyers' perception of both the retailer and the product. When discussing the guitar's performance, the reviewer states, \\"When you plug it in, it only gets better,\\" implying that the sound and overall experience of using the guitar exceed their expectations. This statement underscores the guitar's exceptional performance, which is a key factor for buyers when deciding on a musical instrument. Finally, the reviewer's repeated use of exclamation marks and enthusiastic wording conveys their excitement and satisfaction with the product. This further strengthens the positive image of the guitar, as potential buyers may assume that if someone is this enthusiastic about their purchase, the product must be worth considering. In conclusion, this review paints the guitar in a highly flattering light, emphasizing the positive aspects such as excellent customer service from the store, the product's high quality and performance, and the reviewer's sheer satisfaction with their purchase. This favorable review can significantly impact potential buyers' perception of the guitar and may be influential in their decision-making process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? no , i love it ... hell , i dunno .","completion":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence appears to be positive with a touch of confusion or uncertainty. The use of \\"no\\" at the beginning may allude to the reviewer countering a negative assumption or idea about the movie. The following phrase, \\"i love it,\\" clearly demonstrates a positive sentiment towards the movie, expressing enjoyment and appreciation for it. Adding the word \\"hell\\" before the next statement intensifies the emotion of the speaker, displaying that they have strong positive feelings about the movie. However, the concluding phrase, \\"I dunno,\\" introduces an element of doubt or uncertainty regarding their own feelings or reasons for loving it. This may indicate that the reviewer is experiencing confusion about the source of their affection or can't pinpoint what specific aspects of the movie evoke their strong emotions. Overall, the sentiment leans more towards the positive end of the spectrum, as the sentence primarily highlights the reviewer's love for the movie.

Write a summary based on this article: For more than 10 years, it was something Mindy McGillivray said she shared only with a close circle of family and friends. That changed Sunday night. Donald Trump was asked during the presidential debate about when he bragged that he kissed women without their consent and grabbed their genitals – remarks captured on audio that surfaced last week. Photographer Ken Davidoff and his friend, Mindy McGillivray, at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 24, 2003. News | WFXT Trump apologized for the remarks and dismissed them as “locker room talk.” But the debate moderator, CNN’s Anderson Cooper, asked Trump to clarify: “Have you ever done those things?” “No, I have not,’’ Trump replied. Watching at home in Palm Springs, McGillivray said she rose from her couch and yelled at the TV screen: “‘You liar!’’’ Read more of The Palm Beach Post's coverage of Donald Trump McGillivray, 36, said she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago 13 years ago. She said she never reported it to authorities. Many McGillivray says she is leaving country But her companion that day, photographer Ken Davidoff, vividly remembers when McGillivray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and told him, ‘’Donald just grabbed my ass!’’ The New York Times reported Wednesday that two other women came forward to say Trump groped them — one who sat next to him on a flight 30 years ago and another who encountered him outside an elevator at Trump Tower. The Post has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about McGillivray’s story. More Trump news: Trump sex-brag tape released on eve of second debate | Heartland verdict: Trump’s still in it According to Davidoff, it was Jan. 24, 2003, when he and his father, the late Palm Beach society photographer Bob Davidoff, took photos at Mar-a-Lago during a concert by Ray Charles. Bob Davidoff for years was the Kennedys’ favored photographer in Palm Beach. Ken Davidoff said he brought his friend McGillivray to help him during the concert. Her job was to keep numbered name plates of everyone the Davidoffs photographed. The Davidoffs were the official photographers of Mar-a-Lago, a deal they got only after Trump demanded he get 20 percent of their proceeds, Ken Davidoff said. McGillivray, who was 23 at the time, said it was one of five or six times she helped Davidoff on photo shoots at Mar-a-Lago. “Ken says, ‘We’re going to get backstage. Ray Charles is going to be there.’ He was one of my idols,’’ she recalled. “Ken wanted to get a picture of me and Ray, but that didn’t happen because he had all these bodyguards.’’ After the show, Davidoff and McGillivray were standing in a pavilion behind the main house in the middle of a group of people. To their left was Regis Philbin and his wife, Joy, according to Davidoff. To McGillivray’s immediate right was Trump and his fiancée, Melania. “Ray already performed. He’s ready to leave. He’s saying his goodbyes to everyone,’’ McGillivray recalled. “All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it’s Ken’s camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there’s Donald. He sort of looked away quickly. I quickly turned back, facing Ray Charles, and I’m stunned.’’ McGillivray said she remembers saying to herself, ‘’‘OK, am I going to say something now and make a scene or be quiet?’ I chose to stay quiet.’’ Davidoff said he did not witness the alleged groping but he said he has never had any reason to doubt McGillivray. Asked about the possibility that what she felt was Trump or someone accidentally bumping into her, McGillivray said no. “This was a pretty good nudge. More of a grab,’’ she said. “It was pretty close to the center of my butt. I was startled. I jumped.’’ She said she had had another encounter with Trump about two years earlier at Mar-a-Lago, when she helped Davidoff photograph a New Year’s Eve party in 2001. She was walking out of a restroom “and Donald caught me right before I headed downstairs. He goes, ‘It’s a cool evening, isn’t it?’’’ she said, mocking his voice. “He had this debonair tone. He was totally flirting,’’ she said. “And then here comes Melania to save the day. She sees me. She had this shawl on because it was cold on New Year’s. And she whips the shawl behind her neck and storms off into the bathroom. I made a quick pivot and went straight downstairs and he went after her.’’ Related: Full presidential election coverage After the alleged groping incident, McGillivray never encountered Trump again. She said the incident is something she and her family and the Davidoffs would bring up periodically over the years, sometimes joking about it. When Trump entered the presidential race, she said she started telling the story to more friends. One day last week, Davidoff came across a photo his father took that night in 2003 of Trump and Charles. “He sent it to me and was like, ‘Remember that night?’ ‘Oh, yeah. I remember that night,’’’ McGillivray said. When Trump told Cooper during the debate Sunday that he never groped a woman, McGillivray said she started to consider sharing her story. With Davidoff’s help, she reached out separately to The Palm Beach Post and to a Hillary Clinton campaign office on Lake Worth Road. She knows her past may be scrutinized. She told The Post she has numerous traffic infractions over the years and two felony arrests. She was arrested when she was 17 for breaking into a school and got probation. And in 2012, she was arrested on DUI and child neglect charges because a child was in the car. She was adjudicated guilty of a misdemeanor. She is registered to vote as having no party affiliation. She said she would have loved to see Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination but she will vote for Clinton. It’s important “to set a good example for my daughter,’’ she told The Post. “It’s a respect issue for all women. If something like this happens to you, you should speak up.’’ Staff researcher Melanie Mena contributed to this story. ||||| The New York Times' general counsel has just informed Donald Trump's lawyer, in scathing terms, that it will not retract its story about two women who claim that Trump touched them inappropriately. In a letter to Trump attorney Marc E. Kasowitz sent Thursday, New York Times general counsel David McCraw wrote, of the request that the Times retract the story, \\"We decline to do so.\\" McCraw then laid into Kasowitz and his client, writing, \\"The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one's reputation. Mr. Trump has bragged about his non-consensual sexual touching of women. He has bragged about intruding on beauty pageant contestants in their dressing rooms. He acquiesced to a radio host's request to discuss Mr. Trump's own daughter as a 'piece of ass.' Multiple women not mentioned in our article have publicly come forward to report on Mr. Trump's unwanted advances.\\" He continued: \\"Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.\\" Times sources told CNNMoney there were spontaneous bursts of applause for McCraw when he walked through the paper's newsroom on Thursday afternoon. Related: Read full letter by the New York Times Trump said at a Thursday afternoon rally in Florida that \\"we are preparing\\" a suit against The Times. Nothing has been filed yet. \\"Lawyers are doing the due diligence needed to file such a massive suit,\\" a Trump campaign official said on condition of anonymity. Legal experts have doubts that Trump will actually file such a suit. The Times story featured two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, who said that Trump made inappropriate physical advances on them. CNN has not been able to independently confirm their accounts. When Times reporter Megan Twohey interviewed Trump by phone Tuesday night, \\"he threatened to sue us if we published these allegations,\\" Twohey told CNNMoney. She quoted Trump as saying that \\"none of this ever took place.\\" She said Trump shouted at her and called her \\"a disgusting human being.\\" Twohey also received a legal letter from a Trump attorney Wednesday afternoon. The Times published the story online shortly before 7 p.m. Eastern. \\"I think it is pretty evident this story falls clearly in the realm of public service journalism, and discussing issues that arose from the tape and his comments since it surfaced,\\" Times executive editor Dean Baquet told CNNMoney. The legal threats continued Wednesday night. \\"NYT editors, reporters, politically motivated accusers better lawyer up,\\" a Trump campaign official said. Shortly after midnight Thursday, a lawyer representing Trump, Marc E. Kasowitz, sent a letter to Baquet saying \\"your article is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se.\\" \\"We hereby demand that you immediately cease any further publication of this article, remove it from your website and issue a full and immediate retraction and apology. Failure to do so will leave my client with no option but to purse all available actions and remedies,\\" Kasowitz wrote. The letter lacks any substantive facts to cast doubt on the Times story, and is not a lawsuit. In his response to Kasowitz, McCraw -- who canceled his \\"annual update on newsroom law\\" session that he was going to hold for staffers on Thursday -- also wrote, \\"The women quoted in our story spoke out on an issue of national importance -- indeed, an issue that Mr. Trump himself discussed with the whole nation watching during Sunday night's presidential debate.... It would have been a disservice not just to our readers but to democracy itself to silence their voices.... If Mr. Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight.\\" What might happen next? Along with the potential suit against the Times, high-ranking sources within the Trump campaign also said they were \\"drafting\\" a lawsuit against The Palm Beach Post, which published a separate story. A lawyer for Trump similarly threatened to sue The Times when it published several pages of his 1995 tax return earlier this month, but did not follow through. If the Trump campaign does proceed with lawsuits in this case, it would be a break from past practice, and it will give both the Times and the Post the opportunity to pursue discovery and request information on Trump's entire sexual history, because Trump would have the burden of proving falsity and actual malice. In the Times story, Leeds alleges that Trump, whom she says she had never met before, grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt while the two were on an airplane more than three decades ago. Crooks, who worked in Trump Tower at a company that Trump did not own, says Trump kissed her outside an elevator after she introduced herself. The Post features a woman named Mindy McGillivray who says she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago when she was 23. Twohey said Crooks, who was was initially reluctant to speak publicly, reached out to the newspaper after it published a story in May titled \\"Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private.\\" Leeds, the other woman in the Times article, contacted the newspaper after Sunday's debate, when Trump was asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper if he had ever done the things he described in that video. \\"No, I have not,\\" Trump said. Michael Barbaro, who co-bylined the story with Twohey, tweeted Wednesday night, \\"This story might not have happened unless @andersoncooper had asked the pointed questions he did at debate.\\" The Times report comes in the wake of the release of a 2005 recording in which Trump boasted about being able to kiss women and grope them in ways that would amount to sexual assault. In a statement on the Times' report earlier on Wednesday night, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the \\"entire article is fiction.\\" \\"For the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,\\" Miller said in the statement. \\"To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election.\\" Late Wednesday night, People Magazine also published a report by one of its writers, Natasha Stoynoff, in which she alleged that she had been physically attacked by Trump at Mar-a-Lago while writing a profile on Trump's one-year wedding anniversary to his wife Melania. CNN has not been able to independently confirm her account. The Trump campaign did not respond to request for comment regarding that story, but a Trump spokesperson told People, \\"This never happened. There is no merit or veracity to this fabricated story.\\" On Thursday morning, Trump also took to Twitter to say, \\"Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the 'incident' in her story. Because it did not happen!\\" A lawyer for Melania Trump sent a letter to People, demanding only that certain lines be removed from the story. Those sentences depicted a friendly encounter between Mrs. Trump, her son Baron and Stoynoff some time after the alleged incident with Trump. Melania Trump's lawyers insist that the encounter never happened and want that section of the story retracted and an apology issued. People Magazine editor-in-chief Jess Cagle responded in a statement, writing, \\"We are grateful to Natasha Stoynoff for telling her story. Ms. Stoynoff is a remarkable, ethical, honest and patriotic woman, and she has shared her story of being physically attacked by Donald Trump in 2005 because she felt it was her duty to make the public aware. To assign any other motive is a disgusting, pathetic attempt to victimize her again. We stand steadfastly by her, and are proud to publish her clear, credible account of what happened.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"Mindy McGillivray claims she was groped by Donald Trump 13 years ago at Mar-a-Lago when she was doing work as an assistant for a photographer at an event.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What do you know at 70 that you wish you knew at 45? What one thing do you wish you had known about life when you were in your 20s?","completion":"Although both questions delve into the realm of hindsight and wisdom acquired with age, they address different perspectives and life stages. Let's break down the two questions to better understand their nuances: 1. What do you know at 70 that you wish you knew at 45? This question specifically targets an individual who is currently 70 years old or older. It prompts them to reflect on the knowledge and insights they have gained in the past 25 years and to consider which ones of those they wish they had had when they were 45 years old. The age gap mentioned highlights the idea that a considerable amount of learning and life experiences have occurred between these two points, which might have led to new realizations and understandings about life, relationships, career, health, and personal growth. 2. What one thing do you wish you had known about life when you were in your 20s? This question focuses on the lessons that people wish they had known earlier in life, specifically during their 20s. This is a more generalized inquiry that does not require the individual to necessarily be at any specific older age. Instead, it invites people of all ages to share a piece of wisdom they wish they had known during their 20s, which might have significantly influenced their life choices, decisions, and paths. This could encompass various aspects of life, such as relationships, career, finances, and personal development. In conclusion, while both questions center around reflecting on life experiences and the wisdom gained from them, they differ in terms of the age group they address and the specific timeframe between the two life stages. The first question targets individuals who are 70 years old or older and focuses on insights gained between the ages of 45 and 70, whereas the second question is more open to people of all ages and emphasizes the knowledge they wish they had had during their 20s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Came here last weekend with the family because I've been craving for some mahi mahi for awhile. We ordered 2 mahi mahi dinners, butterfish, and chilli with spaghetti. Mahi mahi was good as always!

It was the frat time we ordered chilli. Can't go wrong with that either. After all, it's Zippys! Can't believe we didn't know that after all year years..
