(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal became the second man to win four successive French Open titles on Sunday after crushing world No. 1 Roger Federer in straight sets in the final in Paris. The Spaniard triumphed 6-1 6-3 6-0 to hand Federer a third straight defeat in the final at Roland Garros, with the Swiss top seed still seeking to win the only Grand Slam crown missing from his collection. And the manner of his comprehensive victory left little doubt that Federer, who has won 12 other Grand Slam titles, may struggle for many years to come in his bid to defeat his nemesis.

Pick your answer from: --Patricia hated the smell of it. --Jessica hated the smell of it.","completion":"Jessica hated the smell of it. The sun was shining through the windows of their family playroom, where Patricia and Jessica often spent their afternoon playing. On this particular day, Patricia came into the room with her latest obsession – a fresh jar of slime – excited to show it to her sister. She loved its gooey, stretchy texture and the way it molded and squished between her fingers. However, Jessica had a different opinion on the matter. As soon as Patricia opened the jar of slime, the strong odor of the gooey substance filled the room. Jessica, being extremely sensitive to smells, instantly recoiled and covered her nose. The pungent scent brought tears to her eyes and she felt a wave of nausea wash over her. \\"Ugh! What is that smell?\\" Jessica cried out, trying to escape the scent. \\"It's just my slime, Jess,\\" Patricia answered, puzzled by her sister's reaction. \\"I thought we could play with it together.\\" Jessica shook her head vehemently, \\"No way! I can't stand the smell of that stuff.\\" Jessica's strong disapproval of the slime's smell disheartened Patricia, but she understood that not everyone would share her love for the peculiar toy. In hopes of finding an alternative activity they could both enjoy, Patricia suggested, \\"Why don't we try making our own slime? That way, we can control what goes into it, and maybe you won't mind the smell as much.\\" Jessica considered the proposition. She had to admit, she was intrigued by the idea of creating something together with her sister. So, with a resigned sigh, she said, \\"Alright, but only if we can make it as odorless as possible.\\" The sisters gathered all the necessary materials to make their own slime, including water, glue, borax, and some optional food coloring. To eliminate the offensive odor, Patricia and Jessica decided to add a few drops of lavender essential oil to their slime mixture, which they both enjoyed. As they mixed and kneaded the concoction, Jessica became more and more enthralled by the slime-making process. She was pleasantly surprised to find that the lavender-scented slime they'd created was far more enjoyable than the store-bought one Patricia had previously brought into their playroom. The two of them spent hours playing with their homemade goo, creating marvelous shapes and designs, and laughing together. From then on, making and playing with slime became a regular bonding activity for Patricia and Jessica, often experimenting with new, more pleasant scents and colors. And while Jessica still couldn't bring herself to enjoy store-bought slime, sharing the experience of creating their own with her sister was something she would always cherish."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

This sentence indicates that the story revolves around a treehouse that is not built up high but is on the ground. Hence, the title should have a connection to the treehouse. Part #2: Identifying connection with fear of heights. Usage: Sentence 2: We were afraid of heights so we found a tree with a big hole. This sentence suggests that the story revolves around the fear of heights, and the protagonists found a tree with a hole to accommodate their fear. Part #3: Explaining the activities within the treehouse. Usage: Sentence 3: We climbed inside and sat there to talk for hours. Sentence 4: We played with the little bugs in the dirt. These sentences specify that the story involves talking and playing with bugs in their unique treehouse. Part #4: Implying the longevity and significance of the meeting spot.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Condé Nast looks to cut more than 20M from its budget Condé Nast is looking to trim 20 million to 30 million in annual costs, sources say, as the company braces for a long-rumored reorganization in the ranks. Budgets are due to be submitted Friday. They already contain cuts, but sources say that may only serve as a starting point for the next round of belt-tightening. “It’s no secret that [Chief Executive] Bob Sauerberg has been working on a reorg,” said one knowledgeable source. That reorganization is expected within 2¹/₂ weeks. Women’s Wear Daily, the fashion trade, has helped fan the flames, with at least two stories on the topic in recent weeks outlining plans for the Newhouse-controlled publisher to go to group publisher and category sales arrangement. One potential date for a reorganization — right after Labor Day — came and went with no re-org. “Everyone expected it right after Labor Day,” said one insider. “Nobody knows why it was delayed.” The added wait has only served to crank up the rumor mill into a higher gear — and for some to suffer from rumor fatigue. “I just stopped asking,” shrugged one source. A Condé Nast spokeswoman said the company doesn’t “comment on rumor and speculation.” Summary:","completion":"Condé Nast, a global mass media company, is reportedly planning to cut 20 million to 30 million in annual costs as it braces for a potential reorganization. Budgets containing cuts are already set to be submitted, with more belt-tightening measures expected in the coming weeks.

Information: - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance. Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals. - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - The New Mexico Territory, which included the areas which became the modern U.S. states of New Mexico and Arizona as well as the southern part of Nevada, played a role in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. Both Confederate and Union governments claimed ownership and territorial rights over it. In 1861 the Confederacy claimed the southern tract as its own Arizona Territory and waged the ambitious New Mexico Campaign in an attempt to control the American Southwest and open up access to Union California. Confederate power in the New Mexico Territory was effectively broken after the Battle of Glorieta Pass in 1862. However, the territorial government continued to operate out of Texas, and Confederate troops marched under the Arizona flag until the end of the war. Additionally, over 8,000 troops from New Mexico Territory served the Union. - A battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces, or combatants. A war sometimes consists of many battles. Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment. - The New Mexico Campaign was a military operation of the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War from February to April 1862 in which Confederate Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley invaded the northern New Mexico Territory in an attempt to gain control of the Southwest, including the gold fields of Colorado and the ports of California. Historians regard this campaign as the most ambitious Confederate attempt to establish control of the American West and to open an additional theater in the war. It was an important campaign in the war's Trans-Mississippi Theater, and one of the major events in the history of the New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War. - Glorieta Pass (elevation 7500 ft.) is a high mountain pass in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern New Mexico. The pass is at a strategic location near at the southern end of the Sangre de Cristos in east central Santa Fe County southeast of the city of Santa Fe. - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - The Sangre de Cristo Mountains (Spanish for \\"Blood of Christ\\") are the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. They are located in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico in the United States. The mountains run from Poncha Pass in South-Central Colorado, trending southeast and south, ending at Glorieta Pass, southeast of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The mountains contain a number of fourteen thousand foot peaks in the Colorado portion, as well as all the peaks in New Mexico which are over thirteen thousand feet. - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865. It was originally formed by seven slave states South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. - Glorieta Pass Battlefield , also known as Glorieta Pass , was the site of a decisive American Civil War battle that ended Confederate ambitions to cut off the West from the Union . The Battle of Glorieta Pass took place on March 26 -- 28 , 1862 . The battlefield area consists of two sites , a 294 - acre ( 1.19 km2 ) parcel and a 150 - acre ( 0.61 km2 ) parcel . The battlefield was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961 . Parts of the battlefield are preserved in Pecos National Historical Park . - The Territory of New Mexico was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed (with varying boundaries) from September 9, 1850, until January 6, 1912, when the remaining extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of New Mexico. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - The Battle of Glorieta Pass, fought from March 26 to 28, 1862 in northern New Mexico Territory, was the decisive battle of the New Mexico Campaign during the American Civil War. Dubbed the \\"Gettysburg of the West\\" (a term that \\"serves the novelist better than the historian\\") by some authors, it was intended as the killer blow by Confederate forces to break the Union possession of the West along the base of the Rocky Mountains. It was fought at Glorieta Pass in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in what is now New Mexico, and was an important event in the history of the New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. and the situation: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination.

OPTIONS: * description * entity * abbreviation * human * numeric * location Answer:","completion":"The question \\"What Broadway musical was inspired by Cervantes's Don Quixote?\\" is asking about the entity. Specifically, it is inquiring about a particular Broadway musical that took inspiration from the famous novel Don Quixote, written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes. The question is seeking the name of this musical production, signifying that it is looking for information related to an entity, i.e., the musical itself. Broadway has a long history of producing adaptations, both from literary and other entertainment sources. In this scenario, the question asks which of these productions is based on the story of Don Quixote. It is important to note that the focus of the inquiry lies within the artistic sphere, surrounded by the creative process and theatrical representations. In other words, this question is not about describing the musical in detail, providing an abbreviation, supplying numeric data, mentioning a specific human related to it, or identifying a location. To provide a comprehensive response, the 1965 Broadway musical \\"Man of La Mancha\\" is inspired by Cervantes's Don Quixote. The musical, with music by Mitch Leigh, lyrics by Joe Darion, and a book by Dale Wasserman, combines the story of Don Quixote with that of Miguel de Cervantes himself, who becomes a character in the play. \\"Man of La Mancha\\" is renowned for its award-winning song \\"The Impossible Dream,\\" which has become an enduring symbol of hope and perseverance. The musical focuses on the transformative power of storytelling, as Cervantes magically gives life to the deluded knight-errant, Don Quixote, and his devoted sidekick, Sancho Panza. Throughout the performance, Don Quixote embarks on several adventures, desperately trying to protect the innocent and conquer evil in a world obsessed with realities. Ultimately, the story teaches the audience about the importance of imagination, the need for hope, and the power of believing in a better future. Hence, the question seeks to identify the specific Broadway musical entity that was inspired by Cervantes's iconic novel, Don Quixote, which is \\"Man of La Mancha.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The event is marked by a grand movie premiere, with everyone anticipating a night filled with entertainment and intrigue. The protagonist, private investigator Lucy Hartwell, is drawn into the case when Mitch, a renowned movie critic, is found dead in the theater shortly after the premiere. With the town in shock, the theater's board members scramble to protect its reputation and hire Lucy to solve the case discreetly. As Lucy delves deeper into her investigation, she discovers a web of secrets and betrayals surrounding the theater. She uncovers that Mitch, known for his scathing reviews, had aggressively criticized an upcoming film directed by Rico, an aspiring filmmaker. Rico, feeling humbled and angry over the disastrous reviews that may sink his career, becomes the prime suspect. Lucy believes that there's more to the case than just a disgruntled filmmaker. As she interviews other suspects, she uncovers a plot of jealousy and greed surrounding the Starlight Theater. An unknown informant reveals that Mitch was receiving bribes from big movie studios to write negative reviews of indie films, skewing ticket sales in favor of blockbusters. This revelation threatens the very existence of the beloved Starlight Theater and leads to a confrontation between Lucy and the board members, who keep insisting Rico is the killer to divert attention from Mitch's nefarious activities. However, Lucy is not one to back down from the truth. Through her perseverance and questioning, she narrows down her list of suspects. Lucy ultimately gathers enough evidence to incriminate the real murderer in Mitch's death: Rico's once-loyal assistant, who had secretly been working with Mitch. In a thrilling climax, Lucy confronts the assistant, unmasking the culpable individual amidst a crowded theater gala. The assistant, ultimately seeking revenge against Mitch for hindering Rico's career and the assistant's chance for success, confesses to the crime before being taken into custody. The town, now reveling in the truth and justice provided by Lucy's diligent efforts, is left with a renewed appreciation for the Starlight Theater and the power of independent cinema. With the theater's reputation restored, Lucy returns to her work as a private investigator, her unconventional methods and unwavering resolve once more proving to be indispensable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pear is in the blue_envelope. Avery exited the basement. Logan moved the pear to the green_bottle. Where does Logan think that Avery searches for the pear?","completion":"To answer the question, I will go through the story step-by-step: 1. Logan entered the basement. 2. Avery entered the basement. 3. The pear is in the blue_envelope. 4. Avery exited the basement. 5. Logan moved the pear to the green_bottle. Now, to determine where Logan thinks Avery searches for the pear, we need to examine Logan's belief in relation to Avery's perceived belief. In this story, Logan's belief matches reality since he knows the current location of the pear (i.e., the green_bottle). However, Avery has a false belief about the pear's location, as she is unaware of Logan moving it. Therefore, this story represents a mix of Scenario (1) and Scenario (3). Logan's belief matches reality, but Avery has a false belief. Since the question is about where Logan thinks Avery searches for the pear, we need to examine Logan's understanding of Avery's belief. At the time Avery left the basement, the pear was in the blue_envelope. So, Logan would reasonably assume that Avery still believes the pear is in the blue_envelope. Thus, Logan thinks Avery searches for the pear in the blue_envelope."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

One evening, after getting drunk at a bar, Mitch and Dave urinate in a park's fountain, and simultaneously wish that they had each other's lives. The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Dave's law firm office, he befriends Dave's attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay. However, Mitch's lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno). Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Mitch has had a crush on. After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to doing everything Dave's life demands, from taking care of the kids and buying groceries to making decisions at the firm. On the night of her ballet recital, Cara, Dave's eldest child, is about to be pushed by another girl who has a habit of bullying her, but takes Mitch's advice and throws her to the floor, to which Mitch foul-mouthedly cheers. Cara tells Mitch that she loves him and Mitch says the same thing, but feels guilty for doing so immediately after. That night, Mitch and Jamie begin to have sex with each other, but Mitch angrily finds that his guilt will not allow him to become erect, and he admits that he is not cut out for the responsibilities of an adult. Jamie comforts him, and he discreetly rests his head on her breasts. The answer is:","completion":"The assistant, Sabrina McKay, is going on a date with Dave.

In the common law of torts, res ipsa loquitur (Latin for \`\`the thing speaks for itself'') is a doctrine that infers negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved. Although modern formulations differ by jurisdiction, common law originally stated that the accident must satisfy the necessary elements of negligence: duty, breach of duty, causation, and injury. In res ipsa loquitur, the elements of duty of care, breach and causation are inferred from an injury that does not ordinarily occur without negligence Can we conclude that res ipsa loquitur means the thing speaks for itself and is related to causation?","completion":"Yes, little buddy!

I also think my work is important. There was a time when I thought I would never have that sort of career . I wasn't an excellent student because I didn't do much schoolwork. In my final term I started thinking what I might do and found I didn't have much to offer. I just accepted that I wasn't the type to have a career. I then found myself a job, looking after two little girls. It wasn't too bad at first. But the problems began when I agreed to live in, so that I would be there if my boss had to go out for business in the evening. We agreed that if I had to work extra hours one week, she'd give me time off the next. But unfortunately, it didn't often work out. I was getting extremely tired and fed up, because I had too many late nights and early morning with the children. One Sunday, I was in the park with the children, and met Megan who used to go to school with me. I told her about my situation. She suggested that I should do a course and get a qualification if I wanted to work with children. I didn't think I would be accepted because I didn't take many exams in school. She persuaded me to phone the local college and they were really helpful. My experience counted for a lot and I got on a parttime course. I had to leave my job with the family, and got work helping out at a kindergarten. Now I've got a fulltime job there. I shall always be thankful to Megan.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Mercedes tries to use Martin Luther King's image to drive car sales Martin Luther King Jr.: preacher, civil rights icon, martyr -- and German luxury-car pitchman? Well, yes. The modern champion of racial emancipation is one of the unlikely stars of a new ad for Mercedes-Benz that uses some famous faces and evokes some historical moments, real and staged, on behalf of the automaker's most advanced, and most expensive, new model. Grainy footage of King, arms raised in mid-oratory, appears briefly in the commercial, followed by flashes of others in a similar posture, including Muhammad Ali dancing around a fallen ring opponent, the late maestro Leonard Bernstein in concert and tennis star Roger Federer falling to his knees to celebrate a victory. There's also a snippet of people raising their arms in triumph during the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and a re-created scene of technicians exulting over the Apollo moon landing in 1969. The message: Raising your arms is a universal symbol of triumph -- just like the raised \\"gull-wing\\" doors of the new Mercedes SLS AMG coupe. The visual echo is intended, say the ad's creators. While the ad doesn't mention it, the SLS AMG retails for 175,000 -- which probably wasn't what King had in mind when he was advocating economic justice for America's poor in the 1960s. This isn't the first time King has been pressed into service as a commercial pitchman. Apple Inc. used an image of King in 1999 in its \\"Think Different\\" campaign, which also featured such major 20th-century figures as Gandhi and Picasso. Alcatel Americas, a French-owned telecommunications company, featured footage of King's \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in a 2001 commercial that showed him speaking to an empty Mall, which Alcatel saw as demonstrating the need to \\"connect\\" with an audience. Mercedes's new ad is reminiscent of a 2006 Chevrolet pickup truck ad that used a montage of historic events and images, including King, Ali, the moon landing, the Vietnam War and a 9/11 memorial in New York. The ad was set to a John Mellencamp song, \\"Our Country.\\" The King family's efforts to commercialize King's legacy have drawn periodic criticism, beginning in 1997 when the family struck a multimillion-dollar deal with Time Warner to produce recordings of his speeches and books based on his writings. The family's supporters said the arrangement would spread King's message and help support the nonprofit King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta. King's heirs licensed the footage to Mercedes for an undisclosed fee through their for-profit company, Intellectual Properties Management of Atlanta. IPM's representatives didn't respond to requests for comment. Mercedes's use of King's image raises a few issues for Clayborne Carson, director of the King Research and Education Institute at Stanford University and the editor of King's papers. Carson says he was surprised by the German automaker's attempt to associate its high-end cars with King, particularly at a time when such luxury goods are unattainable for more and more Americans. \\"I wish that whenever King is used in an ad the purpose is to draw attention to King and his legacy and not simply as a way to attract attention to the advertiser,\\" Carson says. \\"The message should be, 'We're honoring King,' instead of, 'You should buy a Mercedes.' \\" In this case, \\"you have to ask: Is King being used to draw consumers to a product, or is the company using its clout to associate itself with a positive legacy? Sometimes it's a close call, but clearly, here the intent is to sell Mercedeses.\\" Executives at Merkley & Partners of New York, Mercedes USA's domestic ad agency, say the spot evolved late last year when they saw the first production photos of the new SLS AMG. Andy Hirsch, the agency's creative director, noticed that the doors of the car, when raised, looked like a person gesturing in victory. Hence the theme for the ad, playing off \\"the universality of the gesture,\\" says Alex Gellert, Merkley's chief executive. The agency assembled a series of scenes tying in to the gesture: a runner crossing the finish line, a rock band finishing a song to cheers, a young pitcher getting the last out, etc. The famous individuals, from King to Federer to skater Michelle Kwan, were chosen because \\"they're people we all look up to,\\" according to Hirsch. Gellert acknowledges that King isn't actually making a triumphal gesture in the footage used in the ad. \\"It's more like punctuation,\\" he said. The King segment involved a bit of staging. In the commercial, his image appears on an old TV set as a young couple watch in their living room -- a mash-up of old and new meant to evoke the moment when King's speeches made the news. Mercedes and its agency have heard only praise for the commercial since it began airing nationally, mostly during sports events and late-night shows, Gellert says. \\"We're not making any claim about King or saying that we're doing anything as societally important as what he did,\\" he says. \\"We're just saying that there's this gesture that people do when they want to celebrate and that we have a car that's the best it can be and is worth celebrating. . . . What Martin Luther King did was far more important than any product.\\" Summary:","completion":"Mercedes has made an advertisement for their new car, the SLS AMG coupe. In the ad, they show clips of famous people, like Martin Luther King Jr., Muhammad Ali, and Roger Federer, raising their arms up in victory. They also show the new car with its special doors that open upwards. The ad is trying to say that raising your arms up is a symbol of winning or being the best, just like the new Mercedes car with the special doors that open up."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Its provincial capital is Halifax. Nova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province, with an area of , including Cape Breton and another 3,800 coastal islands. As of 2011, the population was 921,727, making Nova Scotia the second most-densely populated province in Canada with almost . - Halifax Fairview is a former provincial electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada which existed from 1993-2013. It elected one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. In its last configuration, the electoral district included the communities of Fairview, Armdale, Cowie Hill, Fairmount and Kline Heights - all within the Halifax Regional Municipality. - The Nova Scotia New Democratic Party is a social-democratic provincial party in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is aligned with the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). It was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932, and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. It became the governing party of Nova Scotia following the 2009 Nova Scotia election. It is the first New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada to form a government. Much of the party's success prior to the 2009 election was based in the urban areas of the provincial capital, Halifax, however the party's support has grown to the rest of Nova Scotia. - Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers with a widely varied landscape. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. - Atlantic Canada is the region of Canada comprising the four provinces located on the Atlantic coast, excluding Quebec: the three Maritime provinces New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia and the easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2011 was about 2,300,000 on half a million km. - The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (from 1955 the \\"\\") was a social-democratic and democratic socialist political party in Canada. The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan. In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist). - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - Graham Steele ( July 8 , 1964 , Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician , having represented the constituency of Halifax Fairview in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2001 - 2013 for the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party .

Esta división surgió como resultado del plan de reforma que buscaba mejorar la eficiencia, capacidad y competitividad de los puertos de Israel, al mismo tiempo que se establecían estructuras de gestión más claras y descentralización en la administración y operación de cada puerto. La creación de estas tres entidades independientes permitió un enfoque más concentrado en el desarrollo de infraestructura, la optimización de recursos y la expansión del comercio. La Compañía del Puerto de Haifa se centra en el puerto de Haifa, uno de los centros de comercio más importantes para las importaciones y exportaciones de Israel. A través de la implementación de modernas tecnologías portuarias y la promulgación de nuevas políticas, la compañía se ha esforzado en mejorar la eficiencia operativa y ofrecer servicios de alta calidad a sus clientes.

Here are possible answers to this question: - park - fence - ground - vines - full bloom I believe the correct choice is \\"fence\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"fence\\" because it is the most effective and commonly used method for keeping animals out of a garden. Fences provide a physical barrier that can deter or prevent unwanted animals like deer, raccoons, rabbits, and other pests from entering and causing damage to your garden. Let's go over the other options and why they don't fit as well: 1. \\"park\\" - A park is an area designated for recreational use, often with various amenities like playgrounds, open spaces, and walking paths. It doesn't serve as a barrier for animals and won't prevent them from entering a garden. 2. \\"ground\\" - The ground is the surface on which your garden grows. As such, it can't serve as a means to keep animals out of a garden. Animals can walk or burrow through the ground to reach your garden plants. 3. \\"vines\\" - Vines are a type of plant that grows by climbing or trailing along structures. While some vines can act as a natural deterrent for certain animals (e.g., thorny vines discouraging small mammals), they won't provide a strong enough barrier to prevent all animals from accessing your garden. 4. \\"full bloom\\" - Full bloom refers to the period when flowers on a plant are fully open and display their vibrant colors. However, this term doesn't relate to any method used to keep animals out of a garden. Hence, \\"fence\\" is the correct choice as it is a well-known and efficient way to protect a garden from unwanted animals. Fencing can be made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, or even natural barriers like hedges. The height and style of the fence may vary based on the types of animals you want to deter. For example, a taller fence is needed to keep out deer, while a shorter fence with buried sections could be effective at deterring burrowing animals like rabbits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What state was ronald reagan governor of?","completion":"Ronald Reagan was the governor of California, a state located on the west coast of the United States. He held the gubernatorial position from January 2, 1967 to January 6, 1975, serving two consecutive terms. Reagan, an actor-turned-politician, began his political career by participating in the Republican party. His compelling speeches and conservative ideology resonated with many Californians. In 1966, Reagan, a political novice, announced his candidacy for the Governor of California and won the party's nomination. He went on to defeat the incumbent governor, Pat Brown, a Democrat, in the general election. During his tenure as governor, Reagan focused on several key issues, which included fiscal responsibility, welfare reform, public order, and education. Some of the notable achievements during his time in office include: 1. Budget and taxes: Reagan successfully controlled government spending and enacted tax reforms to promote economic growth. In his first year as governor, he managed to close a 200 million deficit by implementing budget cuts, freezing hiring in state agencies, and increasing some taxes. However, he also reduced taxes in his second term, providing relief to both individuals and businesses. 2. Welfare reform: As part of his efforts to reduce government dependence, Reagan implemented the Welfare Reform Act of 1971, which aimed at helping recipients become self-sufficient by getting them into jobs and training programs. 3. Public order: In response to the growing protests and unrest, particularly on college campuses, Reagan focused on restoring public order by enforcing strict measures against disruptive activities. He increased the budget allocated to law enforcement and strengthening legislation to punish violent protests and riots. 4. Education: Reagan contributed to the development of the California State University system by founding several new campuses and emphasized the need for higher education to be accessible and affordable. He also reformed the financing system for California's public schools, in turn, providing extra funds based on enrollment numbers. After completing his two terms as governor, Reagan remained active in politics and eventually became the 40th President of the United States, serving from January 20, 1981, to January 20, 1989. As president, he continued to champion limited government, economic growth, and conservative values; his landmark achievements include the end of the Cold War and an economic revival in the US."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His confusion and embarrassment while trying to ask for them at a pharmacy are comically illustrated throughout the song. \\"House of Fun\\" stayed at the top of the UK Singles Chart for two weeks and became one of the band's signature tunes, often being featured in their live performances. Although many of their other songs reached high positions in the charts, Madness was never able to replicate that success with another number one hit. Madness was formed in London in 1976 and initially drew inspiration from Jamaican ska, a popular music genre characterized by a walking bass line, offbeat guitar or piano rhythms, and brass section. However, over the years their style evolved, incorporating influences from pop, new wave, and motown. Their memorable songs, energetic live performances, and fun, lighthearted image made Madness a music sensation in the UK and beyond.

What do you see? Is it the rolling plains of Kansas, or Manhattan's field of skyscrapers? The foggy Golden Gate, or a gated community? Lately, all I can see is Ferguson, the now-famous Missouri town where, in August, a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown. It's a place no one had heard of a year ago but now finds itself at the center of the news cycle, at the center of our national attention and at the center of a new and profound sense of worry that racial injustice may long divide us still. And, as of 2010, that spot rests in OPTIONS: - America, Missouri. - Benjamin Hoste, Missouri. - CNN, Missouri. - Ferguson, Missouri. - Golden Gate, Missouri. - Kansas, Missouri. - Manhattan, Missouri. - Michael Brown, Missouri. - Missouri, Missouri. - Plato, Missouri. - United States, Missouri.","completion":"And, as of 2010, that spot rests in Plato, Missouri. Plato, a small town located in the heart of Missouri, was designated as the population center of the United States by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010. This particular location signifies the geographical \\"center\\" of the United States when the population is evenly distributed. It is constantly changing with every decennial census as the population shifts due to factors such as migration, urbanization, and population growth trends. While some may argue that the symbolic center of America changes with current events and socio-political situations, such as the events in Ferguson, Missouri, the geographical center remains a stable point of reference. Located in the Midwest, Plato represents the heart of America in more ways than just geography; it is emblematic of the small-town values, tight-knit communities, and the agricultural industries that have historically defined the core of the American identity. Although the tragic events in Ferguson have brought to the forefront ongoing issues surrounding racial injustice and police brutality, the geographical center of America in Plato, Missouri, remains a symbol of the united communities and values that comprise the American landscape. It is vital to continue our national conversation on race, justice, and equality, with the knowledge that our nation's true center lies in the strength and resilience of our diverse and ever-evolving communities."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It described as \\"worthless\\" an appeal by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn. The row erupted after the Dutch barred Turkish ministers from campaigning among expatriates for a referendum. It comes before one of the most closely fought Dutch elections in years. The referendum would controversially boost the powers of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In response to the Dutch move, Turkey barred the Dutch ambassador from returning to Ankara and suspended high-level political talks, while Mr Erdogan accused the Dutch of using Nazi tactics. The Dutch government cited \\"risks to public order and security\\" as reasons for blocking the Turkish rallies. Turkey's foreign ministry said it was \\"grave\\" of the EU to stand by the Netherlands. On Monday, Ms Mogherini and Mr Hahn had called on Turkey to \\"refrain from excessive statements and actions that risk further exacerbating the situation\\". However, responding to the diplomatic sanctions announced by Turkey, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said they were \\"not too bad\\". Rallies were called to encourage Turkey's large expatriate communities in the EU to vote Yes in a referendum on 16 April on expanding the president's powers. Some 5.5 million Turks live outside the country, including an estimated 400,000 in the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities barred two Turkish cabinet ministers from addressing crowds in the city of Rotterdam, with Minister of Family Affairs Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya escorted to the German border after entering the Netherlands by land. Prime Minister Rutte said the city authorities had feared an armed clash between Ms Kaya's security detail and local police. While the Dutch position was that the rallies posed a threat to public order, the EU has made very clear its unease over the Turkish referendum itself. In their statement on Monday, Ms Mogherini and Mr Hahn voiced concern that it could lead to an \\"excessive concentration of powers in one office\\". Mr Erdogan likened the Netherlands to a \\"banana republic\\". The country, which has the sixth largest economy in the EU, is the biggest source of foreign investment in Turkey. In a speech on Tuesday, he accused the Dutch of \\"massacring\\" Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, during the Bosnian civil war in 1995, saying it was evidence of their \\"rotten character\\". Dutch UN peacekeepers failed to protect Muslim civilians sheltering from Bosnian Serb forces. The UN tribunal investigating the massacre of 7,000 men and boys prosecuted Bosnian Serbs for the actual killings. The Dutch prime minister condemned Mr Erdogan's remarks as a \\"vile falsification of history\\". Earlier, he said a comment by Mr Erdogan that the Dutch were \\"Nazi remnants\\" was \\"unacceptable\\", and demanded an apology. The Netherlands was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940 and occupied right up until the final days of World War Two in Europe, in May 1945. Rotterdam was devastated by German bombing during the invasion. Voters in the Netherlands go to the polls on Wednesday for a general election dominated by concerns about immigration and Islamic radicalism. The anti-Islam Freedom Party of Geert Wilders has long been seen as benefiting from the anti-establishment sentiment which fuelled the victories of Brexit campaigners in the UK and Donald Trump in the US last year. However, Mr Rutte's handling of the Turkish rallies may benefit his centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), which governs in coalition with the Labour Party. The Peilingwijzer poll of opinion polls suggests the VVD will win 17% of the vote to 14% for the Freedom Party. Party leaders are due to hold a final debate on Tuesday evening. Mr Erdogan warned on Tuesday of other, unspecified measures Turkey might take against the Netherlands. Relations between the EU and Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country regarded as crucial to tackling Europe's migrant crisis, have long been strained. Turkish officials have suggested reconsidering part of the deal with the EU to stem the flow of undocumented migrants. The number of migrants reaching Greece by sea dropped sharply after the deal was reached in March of last year. Turkey is also a candidate to join the EU but negotiations have made little headway over the last decade. As a Nato state bordering Syria, it is also a vital partner in the campaign to fight so-called Islamic State. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

But recently, some people have been much more concerned with how the grizzly bear and mountain lion can cross the road.

First, let's deal with the w’s. We have -519w and 247w. If you have a basket of -519 apples and add 247 apples, what would you end up with? You would have -272 apples, right? In the same way, -519w and 247w adds up to -272w. The equation now becomes -272 = -272w. Now, to find the value of w, we have to do something that might sound funny but is actually pretty cool. We're going to divide -272 (the number on the left of the equation) by -272 (which is now with our w on the right side). Think of it like sharing -272 sweets equally between -272 kids. Each kid would get just 1 sweet, right? So, when we divide one side by a number, we must also divide the other side by that same number to keep our scales balanced. So, -272 divided by -272 gives us 1, and -272w divided by -272 gives us w. Hence, w = 1. That's your answer! The value of w is 1.

Please write a short summary for the following article: US crypto researchers to NSA: If you must track, track responsibly Jan. 27, 2014 at 3:23 PM ET Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA, file A Maryland State Trooper sits in an unmarked SUV outside the grounds of the National Security Administration just north of Washington, in Fort Meade, Md. A group of cryptography researchers from universities around the country is condemning the weakening of security infrastructure by the U.S. government and NSA, and warning against storing mass amounts of sensitive data. In the open letter published Friday, the researchers write that data collection activities uncovered in the last 10 months stand to \\"chill free speech and invite many types of abuse, ranging from mission creep to identity theft.\\" The group hopes to improve the knowledge of privacy-preserving technology that already exists, that could aid legal surveillance proceed in a targeted manner. Should the NSA choose to use them, the cryptographic research community has and is developing tools and projects that can \\"protect civil liberties while enabling legit government searches,\\" Amit Sahai, a crypto researcher at UCLA who signed the letter, told NBC News. Though, \\"the exact ways in which they would fit together would very much depend on the precise questions that need to be addressed.\\" For example, Sahai noted that a kind of secure communication protocol would let phone companies — rather than the government — hold onto cell phone data, while allowing government entities to selectively search for information on a suspect. In this setup, the phone companies would not be privy to the exact searches, and the government would not have access to all available data. In 2010, the FBI followed digital crumbs to track down a bank-robbing duo who’d been involved in a spate of teller heists across Arizona and Colorado. After getting the greenlight from a judge, feds analyzed data from four Verizon cell towers near affected banks, and found one number that had accessed three of those towers on the days each of the banks was robbed. This turned up the suspects, but according to Ars Technica's report of the event, data from 150,000 cell phones were recovered along the way. In the last year, law enforcement has filed more than 9,000 requests for similar “tower dumps,” according to the Washington Post, rattling civil rights advocates as well as security researchers. Today, there are \\"privacy preserving ways of doing these kinds of computations\\" like looking through mass cell phone records, Bryan Ford, a cryptography researcher at Yale and co-writer of a new letter from the crypto community to the government, told NBC News. \\"Should 149,998 innocent users necessarily get scooped up into this moderately targeted dragnet in order to identify the one criminal? That's not the case.\\" The data already collected is also a cause for concern. \\"The very act of collecting and storing this unprecedentedly massive amounts of sensitive information invites disaster,\\" Joan Feigenbaum, professor of computer science at Yale University, one of the letter's co-authors told NBC News. \\"They’re just asking for some kind of leak or some kind of break in or some kind of corruption of these databases.\\" Encrypting data is one way to secure that information, but encrypted data is notoriously hard to access. Under come circumstances, there are ways to efficiently access it. For example, \\"secure multiparty computation\\" allows for search and calculation on encrypted data, Steven Bellovin, a security researcher at Columbia University wrote to NBC News in an email. But, he added that \\"putting everyone’s phone calls into an encrypted database doesn’t protect privacy; we really need limits on what goes in.\\" Feigenbaum said that members of the security community would be willing to help the government use or craft technologies that could collect information in targeted manner, and store that data safely. \\"A lot of the [current] debate is about a false tradeoff, that we can have either national security or privacy and I think that’s not true,\\" Ford said. Informing the public and policy makers about technology that already exists could go a long way towards \\"actual solutions that serve national security interests and serve privacy and freedom interests.\\" As next steps towards patching some of the vulnerabilities, the group points to the \\"Global Government Surveillance Reform\\" manifesto published by companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft.

Summary:","completion":"A group of cryptography researchers from different universities in the US wrote an open letter, telling the National Security Administration (NSA) and the US government to not weaken security infrastructures and to not store a lot of sensitive information. They said that these actions can lead to people being scared to speak freely and increase the risk of things like identity theft. These researchers want to help the government use technology in a way that respects people's privacy. One example they gave is allowing phone companies to keep cell phone data instead of the government, which can prevent the government from seeing everyone's data. They believe there are ways to protect people's privacy and maintain national security at the same time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Pick from: -- Get a cotton ball and dip it in rubbing alcohol then rub the cotton ball on the glass. -- Get a cotton ball and dip it in rubbing alcohol then rub the cotton ball on the alcohol bottle.","completion":"To create a custom beer mug, it's crucial to properly prepare the glass surface to ensure that any applied paint, engraving, or decal adheres well to the glass. To accomplish this goal, it's best to thoroughly clean the glass in the initial stage of the process. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to prepare your glass beer mug for customization using the given options. 1. Gather the materials: - A glass beer mug - Rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol with at least 70% concentration) - Cotton balls - A clean, lint-free microfiber cloth - Gloves (optional) - Paint, decals, engraving tools, or other methods of customization 2. Wash the glass beer mug: Before starting the customization process, clean the glass thoroughly. Use a mild dishwashing detergent to remove any dirt, grease, or residue. Rinse the glass completely to eliminate soap residues and allow it to air dry or gently wipe it with a lint-free cloth. Avoid touching the glass mug with bare hands once it's clean to prevent fingerprints or oil from your skin from interfering with the customization process. Gloves can be worn as a preventive measure. 3. Clean the surface with rubbing alcohol: Now you should pick the first option provided: \\"Get a cotton ball and dip it in rubbing alcohol then rub the cotton ball on the glass\\". This method will help remove any remaining fingerprints, oils, or residue from the glass surface. Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball. Make sure the cotton ball is saturated but not dripping wet. 4. Rub the glass with the alcohol-soaked cotton ball: Gently rub the surface of the glass beer mug, focusing particularly on the area you wish to customize. Rub in small circular motions to ensure complete coverage. The alcohol will evaporate quickly, leaving no visible residue on the glass. This step will disinfect the surface and create a clean, grease-free platform that will help the paint, decals, or engraving adhere properly and last longer. 5. Allow the glass to air dry: After you have finished rubbing the glass mug with the rubbing alcohol-soaked cotton ball, let it air dry for a few minutes. This will ensure that the rubbing alcohol evaporates completely, leaving the surface ready for customization. 6. Proceed with the customization process: Now that your glass beer mug is clean and prepped, you can proceed with applying paint, decals, or starting the engraving process. Follow the specific instructions provided with your chosen method of customization to achieve the best results. Remember that different types of paint or decals may require a curing or drying process, so be sure to research the appropriate method for the materials and techniques you will be using when customizing your beer mug. In conclusion, properly preparing the surface of your glass beer mug will increase the longevity and quality of your custom design. With a clean, well-prepped surface, you can confidently proceed to create a fantastic personalized beer mug that will impress friends and family alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Article Title: The Miracle Brazilian Baby Who Survived Stray Bullet and Cherishes Hopes for Future Article: In an astounding tale of survival and strength, a Brazilian baby boy has been deemed a miracle after surviving a shooting while still in his mother's womb. The stray bullet, an unintentional bi-product of rampant street violence, ended up embedding itself in the unborn child. The family now cherishes high hopes that their little warrior will one day overcome his injuries and walk. The incident traces back to an unfortunate day when the baby's mother was caught amid gunfire, a recurrent narrative in some Brazilian towns notorious for their high crime rates. In the horror of the moment, a stray bullet traveled its aimless path and ended up in the most vulnerable spot possible - her womb. A routine ultrasound revealed the unimaginable. While the expectant mother was fortunately unhurt, their unborn child bore the brunt of the lethal bullet. The fetal images showed metal lodged into the baby's spine. Amid the shock and despair, doctors prepared the family for the worst, warning them about possible severe impairments. That brings us to the present day, where the extraordinary survival story of this child began. The baby, now several months old, has been defying medical expectations since his birth. With every passing day, he strengthens his claim to his title - the Miracle Baby Boy. He not only survived the gunshot ordeal but is thriving, against all odds. His family, although still reeling from the incident, is brimming with hope. They believe their little miracle will not only live a normal life but will also overcome the potentially crippling injuries. Encapsulated in their faith is a dream - a dream of their son taking his first steps, a dream heightened by every baby step he makes towards recovery. Treatment for the baby is ongoing, and given the complexity of his condition, the path to recovery is steep. His family, underlining the importance of perseverance and patience, is committed to providing the best for him and ensuring he hits every developmental milestone. Stories like these serve as stark reminders of the unintentional victims of gun violence. Yet, they also highlight the invincible spirit of survival and an overwhelming force of faith and hope in the face of the direst circumstances. The miracle baby has already become a symbol of courage and resilience in his community in Brazil. Despite the hardship, his story brings inspiration, instills hope and advocates for love and peace, even amid life's harshest of storms. In every sense of the word, the little boy is a miracle - a shining beacon that life, even when born amidst despair and violence, can be incredibly resilient. Therefore, this tale of survival shall not only make us reflect on the issues that plague our societies but also restore faith in the seemingly impossible. Moreover, it reminds us that miracles do exist, and sometimes, they come in the smallest of forms, defying the mightiest of odds. In the end, it is hope that propels us - hope for a better future, hope for these miracles to overcome challenges and hope for a world where children are born into love and peace, not violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What two wars was Stafford a favorite of many of the servicemen? Answer the above question based on the context below: While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

Here's the equation we want to solve: -11*b = -48*b Now, we'll add +48*b to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -48*b term on the right-hand side, like this: -11*b + 48*b = -48*b + 48*b This will simplify to: 37*b = 0 Now, to solve for b, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 37, like this: 37*b / 37 = 0 / 37 This simplifies to: b = 0 So, the solution of the equation -11*b = -48*b is b = 0.

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2.

The 37-year-old was joined by former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood as director of football in November. Sherwood took a step back from that role in recent times, but the Robins only won two of their final 11 League One matches on their way to relegation. Williams, who has spent the past four years coaching at the County Ground, said after Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Charlton that he would have a meeting with chairman Lee Power. A statement from the Robins said: \\"Following our relegation to League Two, reviews have taken place and, as a result, the football club and Luke Williams have mutually agreed to go their separate ways. \\"The club would also like to confirm that the search for a new candidate to take the club forward is well under way and we will issue a further update in due course.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Sherwood was named director of football at the County Ground, a move described as \\"one of the biggest appointments the club has ever made\\" by Power. The former Spurs manager was given responsibility for \\"transfers, the way we play, the formations and the picking of the team\\" - though Williams was kept in his post. Despite an impressive 3-0 win over Charlton in their first game following Sherwood's arrival, the appointment did not result in a sustained improvement in form, as Swindon have won only seven of their 31 games since his hiring. At times, it was unclear whether or not Sherwood was managing the team, though as the season came to its end his first-team responsibilities decreased, and he did not attend all of the Robins' games. But the return to a more conventional coaching structure did not pay dividends, as a four-game winless run sent them down to the fourth tier for the first time since 2012. Andrew Hawes, BBC Wiltshire's Swindon Town commentator With fan frustration writ large at the County Ground, a continuation of the status quo was pretty much impossible. Power has been open about the failure of the club's recruitment over the past year, and the interlude of Sherwood being the pivotal figure at the training ground didn't really help Williams either. That said, questions remain over whether the style of play Williams was wedded to could both develop players for sale and get results in the nether regions of the EFL - both requirements of the job.

What is the answer for the question: Who does the psychologest give a dilemma to? from the following article ? Donald's Dilemma starts with Daisy narrating her problem to an unseen psychologist through flashback scenes. Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. He regained consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. His singing voice was improved to the degree in which it sounds identical to Frank Sinatra. However, Donald had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head, while in front of a table of other different suicidal methods, including a noose, a grenade, a bomb, a knife, and poison. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so. That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon. At the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or Daisy regains Donald but the world loses him. Posed with the question \\"her or the world\\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - \\"Me! Me! Me! MEEE!!\\". Soon, Donald returns to his old self and forgets about his singing career and Daisy regains her lover.","completion":"The psychologist gives a dilemma to Daisy, who is the one seeking help in the story.

CONTEXT: 13 de enero de 2006 Seis de los principales países contaminantes, que participaron esta semana en la primera reunión de la Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (\\"Asociación de Asia - Pacífico para el Desarrollo y un Ambiente Limpios\\", AP6 o APPCDC), han creado un fondo multimillonario en dólares para desarrollar energía limpia, pero hicieron énfasis en que seguirán dependiendo fuertemente de combustibles fósiles contaminantes por las próximas generaciones. Grupos ecologistas, que calificaron la reunión una \\"farsa\\", han condenado el encuentro realizado en la ciudad de Sydney y lo han llamado \\"pacto carbonífero y nuclear\\" entre los grandes contaminantes y las empresas que producen combustibles fósiles. Observadores australianos del cambio climático han atacado los resultados de la reunión del AP6 como extremadamente irresponsables, diciendo que el Gobierno Federal de su país está dispuesto a aceptar la realidad de un cambio climático desbocado. Un comunicado emitido por el AP6 reza: \\"Reconocemos que los combustibles fósiles reafirman nuestras economías, y serán una realidad duradera por nuestros periodos de vida y más allá\\". Los ecologistas dicen que el pacto ha perdido una oportunidad vital para comprometerse con las fuentes de energía renovables y añadieron que la reunión, que duró 2 días, fracasó en realizar cualquier clase de compromiso para combatir el calentamiento global. Combinados, los Estados Unidos, China, Japón, India, Corea del Sur y Australia suman cerca de la mitad de los gases de invernadero. Los seis países convocaron la reunión como un segundo método de enfrentar el calentamiento global por fuera del Protocolo de Kioto, enfocándose, según ellos, en la \\"tecnología de energía limpia\\". La energía nuclear, las tecnologías de carbón limpio, la retención de dióxido de carbono y fondos ambientales dirigidos a la industria fueron algunas de las propuestas hechas en la cumbre. A diferencia del Protocolo de Kioto, las seis naciones no han fijado meta alguna para reducir los gases de efecto invernadero. Observadores del fenómeno del cambio climático han criticado ampliamente el AP6 diciendo que es una pérdida de tiempo. Clive Hamilton, del Australian Climate Institute, afirma que el encuentro hizo poco para reducir las emisiones de gases de invernadero. \\"En realidad pienso que esta conferencia trata de proteger el futuro a largo plazo de la industria carbonera. Si uno ve la clase de personas de negocios que tienen asiento en la mesa de la conferencia en Sydney, representan abrumadoramente a las industrias contaminantes más que a aquellos que en algún momento los reemplacen: las industrias de energías renovables y de eficiencia energética\\". Por su parte, el Dr. David Brockway, jefe científico de CSIRO, dice que la tecnología necesaria para reducir las emisiones de gases de invernadero no es viable para la industria. \\"Debe tenerse presente que cualquier cosa que vayamos a hacer para reducir las emisiones de gases de invernadero y la intensidad de la economía australiana vendrá como un costo. Lo que estamos haciendo por el momento es investigación para tratar de reducir el tamaño de ese costo adicional. Yo diría que en un lapso de 5 a 10 años, una parte de esas tecnologías se hará viable\\". Un comunicado del AP6 emitido al final de la conferencia dice que las reducciones de gases de invernadero deben lograrse sin entorpecer el crecimiento económico: \\"la asociación desea movilizar la inversión nacional y extranjera hacia la tecnología limpia y de baja emisión mediante el fomento de la mejor tecnología facilitadora posible\\". Algunas de las mayores empresas mineras y energéticas asistieron a las conversaciones y se comprometieron a mejorar la eficiencia. Los ecologistas, marginados de la conferencia, dicen que las conversaciones buscan subvertir el Tratado de Kioto, que obliga a 40 países desarrollados a reducir las emisiones de gases de invernadero a un 5% por debajo de los niveles de 1990 durante el periodo 2008-2012. \\"Básicamente no han acordado hacer nada en términos de compromisos serios\\", señaló la profesora de la Universidad Monash y experta en cambio climático Amanda Lynch. EUA y Australia se resisten a firmar el Protocolo de Kioto afirmando que los recortes de emisiones de gases que impone amenazan el crecimiento de sus economías. John Howard, primer ministro de Australia, dijo que \\"la experiencia nos ha enseñado que buscar objetivos arbitrarios no resulta en lograr soluciones prácticas para el cambio climático global\\". Howard hizo hincapié en la importancia de mantener el crecimiento económico para mitigar la pobreza mientras reduce las emisiones de gases de invernadero. Howard añadió que la cumbre había inyectado \\"una dosis de realismo que le hacía falta al debate sobre el cambio climático. Creemos que es posible abordar temas de gases de invernadero y el reto del cambio climático sin reducir los niveles de vida. El mundo continuará utilizando combustibles fósiles por varios años en el futuro porque es más económico así. Por tanto, es simple sentido común que uno quiera intentar hacer el uso de combustibles fósiles más sensible, uno debería tratar de limpiar el uso del combustible fósil\\". El World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ha descalificado los comentarios de Mr Howard como engañosos e irresponsables. Greg Bourne, jefe ejecutivo del WWF, dijo: \\"en toda mi carrera nunca había visto un anuncio público más engañoso que ese... Si las afirmaciones hechas hoy se hacen realidad, esto nos bloqueará en un crecimiento de 4 grados en las temperaturas globales promedio, cuando 2 grados se consideran extremadamente peligrosos. No ha podido ser más irresponsable que embarcarnos adrede hacia unos incrementos masivos en las emisiones y un calentamiento global desbocado\\" Las naciones pertenecientes al AP6 afirmaron en el comunicado final que los ocho grupos de trabajo creados durante la conferencia, conformados conjuntamente por entidades públicas y privadas, prepararán planes de acción para mediados de 2006 en temas que incluyen la energía renovable, la generación de energía y combustibles fósiles y minería carbonera más limpios. Los ambientalistas dicen que el pacto de Sydney estaba condenado al fracaso porque no impuso metas a sus miembros que pudieran comprometer a cerca de la mitad de la humanidad. El Consejo para la Conservación de la Naturaleza de Nueva Gales del Sur dijo que el acercamiento voluntario del grupo fue una \\"licencia para que el gobierno y las empresas no hicieran nada\\". \\"Sin incentivos ni sanciones, no hay razones para que la industria deje de quemar carbón y gasolina contaminantes\\", señaló Cate Faehrmann, miembro del Consejo. Los países del AP6 acumulan un 49% del PNB mundial, 48% del consumo mundial de energía, 48% de las emisiones de gases de invernadero globales y 45% de la población del mundo. Muchos científicos dicen que el calentamiento global está derritiendo los glaciares, aumentando los niveles del mar y causarán más tormentas, sequías e inundaciones. Los niveles actuales de dióxido de carbono y metano en la atmósfera son más altos ahora que en cualquier momento en los pasados 650.000 años, según demuestran investigaciones de los núcleos de hielo antárticos.

The answers are important enough that they will be a discussion topic of this year's Senior Day at 9 a.m. March 25 in the House Chamber at the Capitol. The following is a preview of some of the answers for review: We can all agree that older Oklahomans need medical care. But even the best care is worthless if an older patient can't drive to the doctor for ongoing treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt dispute. Therefore, lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 Oklahomans age 60 and older. Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment. Lawyers know how to make landlords heat apartments so the medical treatment can stick. (By the way, a May 16, 2001, article in The New York Times reports on a program at Boston Medical Center providing a walk-in legal clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients' legal and administrative battles.) We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process. \\"Old\\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights. Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices. It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use. In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights. They are not to be used to help a family \\"manage\\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient. Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them. But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents. Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems. All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents. Question: \\"What can lawyers do for old people?\\" Answer: \\"Lawyers can help patients avoid debt disputes and can make landlord heat the apartment if the patient need it for Medical purposes. They can also create rights transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders and monitor its use\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Options: +no. +yes.","completion":"Yes, your answer accurately highlights some of the key roles and functions that lawyers can perform for older individuals, including assisting with debt disputes, ensuring proper living conditions, and creating and monitoring documents related to durable powers of attorney and guardianship. These legal services can help elderly Oklahomans navigate complex situations and protect their rights and interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Under his friend's watchful eye, Danny carefully chopped the vegetables, including spring onions, carrots, bell peppers, and peas, slicing them into uniform sizes to ensure even cooking. His friend emphasized the importance of using high-quality soy sauce and sesame oil to enhance the flavors of the dish. While Danny was initially nervous about cooking, his excitement grew as they started to assemble the dish. His friend taught him how to have everything prepared and organized before starting so that the cooking process would go smoothly. Danny heated his wok over high heat and added the vegetables to the searing pan. He listened intently as his friend instructed him on the proper cooking techniques for stir-frying, such as the flick of his wrist to toss the vegetables, ensuring they cooked evenly. Once the vegetables were cooked, Danny moved them to the side of the wok and cracked the eggs into the center. He quickly scrambled them, skillfully mixing them with the vegetables to ensure even distribution. His friend then guided him on how to incorporate the cold rice, breaking up any large clumps, and mixing in the soy sauce, sesame oil, and other seasonings. Seeing the rice sizzle and the aroma wafting through the kitchen brought Danny a sense of accomplishment. His friend nodded with approval, commenting that the color and texture of the dish were perfect. They both knew that the moment of truth would come during the taste test. When it was finally time to sample the dish, Danny nervously held his breath as his friend took the first bite. The smile that crossed his friend's face immediately put Danny at ease, and he knew he had done well. His friend praised the perfect balance of flavors, and the vegetables were cooked just enough to retain their crispness. Danny took a bite for himself, beaming with pride at his handiwork in creating such a delightful meal. Encouraged by his success, Danny embraced the opportunity to continue learning and mastering his cooking skills. He and his friend made plans for future cooking sessions, where they would explore the culinary arts together and expand Danny's culinary repertoire.

Tear off a strip of tape approximately 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) in length and press it into place over the line created by the overlapping material. Run your finger back and forth over the tape a few times to make sure it stays put. Any variety of tape could work, but clear tape tends to be the most forgiving to work with, since it tears and smooths easily and can be peeled off and reapplied if you happen to make a mistake. If you like, you can also cover the seam on the inside of the cone with a second strip of tape to be doubly certain that it will hold. Once you’ve mixed your henna paste, use a spoon to scoop it into the open end and shake the cone gently to help it settle. Be careful not to overfill your cone. Doing so will make it harder to seal, and could result in an unexpected mess. Henna stains very easily, so be sure to pull on a pair of rubber gloves before you begin handling your homemade henna paste. It may also be a good idea to cover your work surface with a layer of paper towels or newsprint.

He immediately developed a career-long antipathy to Dilip Vengsarkar due to his aggressive appealing. Despite doing little of note in the three Tests he played on that tour, he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies' World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were not doing well at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5-13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League. Marshall came to prominence in 1980, when in the third Test at Old Trafford he accounted for Mike Gatting, Brian Rose and Peter Willey in short order to spark an England collapse, although the match was eventually drawn despite Marshall taking 7-24. After 1980/81 he was out of the Test side for two years, but an excellent 1982 season when he took 134 wickets at under 16 apiece, including a career-best 8-71 against Worcestershire, saw him recalled and thereafter he remained a fixture until the end of his international career. In seven successive Test series from 1982/83 to 1985/86 he took 21 or more wickets each time, in the last five of them averaging under 20. His most productive series in this period was the 1983/84 rubber against India, when he claimed 33 wickets as well as averaging 34 with the bat and making his highest Test score of 92 at Kanpur. A few months later he took five in an innings twice at home against Australia.

To break down the premise, the artist is wearing a purple breathing mask and is standing next to a stone wall. They are using aerosol cans to paint on a canvas that is being held up by an easel. These details highlight the artist's equipment and workspace, but there is no clear mention of the state or condition of the surrounding area or the artwork itself. Additionally, wearing a breathing mask is a precaution that many artists take while working with materials like aerosol cans, as the fumes can be hazardous to the artist's health. This does not necessarily indicate messiness on the artist's part, but rather shows that they are taking care of their health and safety. If the premise had mentioned something about the surroundings being covered in paint, lack of organization, or an unstructured painting process, then we might be able to conclude that the hypothesis is correct.

Write an article using the following points: More than 750 foreign criminals are walking the streets after jumping bail. Released from detention under human rights laws and then gone on run. Among those at large are violent criminals, including rapists and killers. Burglars, robbers, violent thugs and drug dealers are also walking streets. Home Office is refusing to identify criminals due to their 'right' to privacy. Article:","completion":"Title: Over 750 Foreign Criminals Roam Free after Jumping Bail Due to Human Rights Laws Introduction: In a shocking revelation, it has been brought to the attention of the public that over 750 foreign criminals are currently walking the streets after having jumped bail. These dangerous individuals were released from detention under human rights laws and have since gone on the run. Even more concerning is among them are violent criminals such as rapists, murderers, and individuals with a history of aggression. Step 1: Discuss the human rights laws and their role in allowing criminals to roam free. The human rights laws in question were designed to protect the rights and dignity of all individuals. Under these regulations, everyone has the right to be treated fairly and with decency. As a result, these criminals were released from detention on the grounds of insuring their basic human rights. Unfortunately, many of them have chosen to take advantage of this situation by disappearing and avoiding the justice system. Step 2: Describe the types of criminals running free and the potential dangers they pose to society. As previously mentioned, the list of runaway criminals encompasses a wide variety of dangerous and violent individuals. Among them are those guilty of serious crimes like murder, rape, and aggravated assault. Add to this the burglars, robbers, and drug dealers, and it's evident that these individuals pose a significant risk to public safety. Step 3: Illustrate the consequences of the situation and its impact on society. The presence of these criminals roaming the streets unchecked will undoubtedly generate fear and mistrust within society. Everyday citizens will be forced to remain vigilant and cautious, as they face potential danger in their own communities. Furthermore, the lack of accountability for these criminals sends the wrong message about the effectiveness of the legal system and creates an environment where criminals may feel empowered to continue their destructive actions. Step 4: Detail the official response and stance of the Home Office. The Home Office, the government department responsible for the country's security and public safety, has thus far refused to identify the criminals currently on the loose. Citing the individuals' right to privacy, the department is effectively shielding them from public scrutiny. This decision has sparked a debate about whether protecting the privacy rights of criminals should take precedence over ensuring the safety and well-being of ordinary citizens. Conclusion: The recent disclosure of over 750 foreign criminals being released from detention and subsequently going on the run brings to the forefront the bigger question about the balance between human rights and public safety. The existence of these dangerous criminals within society cannot be ignored, and it is imperative for government officials and law enforcement to actively pursue and bring these individuals to justice. With public concern on the rise, a reevaluation of current human rights laws and their impact on public safety may be necessary to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future."},{"prompt":"This article: After the band released two slow-paced albums in a row, R.E.M.'s 1994 album Monster was, as Buck said, \\"a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks.\\" In contrast to the sound of its predecessors, the music of Monster consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock.

The singles \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" and \\"Bang and Blame\\" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from Monster reached the Top 30 on the British charts.

On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was only the beginning of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour.

Use evidence from the fact that large trees block sunlight from reaching the ground to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"Which of the following would cause sunlight to better reach the ground of a forest?\\" [a]. more umbrellas. [b]. logging. [c]. more trees. [d]. taller trees.","completion":"The correct answer is [b]. Logging. To provide a detailed and long answer, let us first discuss how large trees block sunlight from reaching the ground, and then analyze each option to determine the most effective solution. Forests, by their very nature, have dense canopies created by the overlapping branches and leaves of trees. These canopies act as a shield and absorb, reflect or refract sunlight, significantly reducing the amount of light that penetrates through the canopy layers and reaches the ground. The larger and taller the trees, the denser and more effective the canopy becomes. This has several ecological consequences, such as lower levels of ground vegetation, cooler temperatures, and higher humidity. Now let's examine each of the given options: [a]. More umbrellas Adding more umbrellas to a forest would not only be counterintuitive, but it would also further block sunlight from reaching the ground. Umbrellas typically block sunlight when they are open, so placing more of them in a forest would only compound the existing problem and not improve the situation. [b]. Logging Logging is the process of cutting down trees, extracting timber, and transporting it to be processed for various purposes. In a forest setting, logging can selectively remove large trees, thereby reducing the density of the canopy and allowing more sunlight to penetrate and reach the forest floor. Scientific research and forestry management practices have shown that properly executed logging operations can improve the growth and regeneration of certain tree species. It also improves the biodiversity of the ecosystem by creating gaps in the canopy that allow more light to reach the ground, fostering the growth of light-dependent plants and encouraging the thriving of various animal species that require different habitat structures. [c]. More trees Adding more trees to a forest would only increase the density of the canopy, consequently blocking more sunlight from reaching the ground. This action contradicts the requirement of the question as it would further darken the forest floor and render the environment even less favorable for understory plant growth and other associated ecological processes. [d]. Taller trees Planting or promoting taller trees may lead to extending the forest canopy higher into the air but this will not inherently increase the amount of sunlight reaching the ground since taller trees could potentially create a denser canopy higher above, effectively preventing or diminishing sunlight penetration. In conclusion, among the given options, logging would be the most effective method to allow sunlight to better reach the ground of a forest. Logging, when conducted responsibly and sustainably, can selectively remove large trees, creating gaps in the canopy, which in turn allow more sunlight to reach the forest floor. This promotes a healthier ecosystem by supporting the growth of light-dependent plants and the thriving of diverse animal species that require varying habitat structures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ernest Edward \\"Ernie\\" Kovacs (January 23, 1919 - January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer. Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom, Chevy Chase, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway, Uncle Floyd, and many others have credited Kovacs as an influence. Chevy Chase thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live. Kovacs's father Andrew emigrated from Hungary at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton. Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Van Kirk's help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City. During this time, he watched many \\"Grade B\\" movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later. A 1938 local newspaper photograph shows Kovacs as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet wearing his trademark mustache. Like any aspiring actor, Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont during 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn't expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals. While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WQXR. By the time he was released, his parents had separated, and Kovacs went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong cigar-smoking habit. Kovacs's first paid entertainment work was during 1941, as an announcer for Trenton's radio station WTTM. He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941. The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it \\"Kovacs Unlimited\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: To prevent cookies from sticking to a baking pan, you can","completion":"To prevent cookies from sticking to a baking pan, there are several methods you can employ. By ensuring that the pan has a non-stick surface, cookies will remain intact when you remove them, making for a more enjoyable baking experience. Here are some of the most effective methods: 1. Use parchment paper: Parchment paper is specifically designed for use in baking and provides a non-stick surface that keeps cookies from sticking to the pan. To use parchment paper, simply cut a piece to fit the bottom of your baking pan, ensuring it covers the entire surface. Place your cookie dough on the parchment paper and bake as per your recipe instructions. When your cookies are done, easily slide the parchment paper, with the cookies still on it, onto a cooling rack, and let them cool for a few minutes before removing them. 2. Silicone baking mats: Silicone baking mats are reusable, non-stick sheets that can be placed directly on your baking pan. These mats provide a consistent, non-stick surface that prevents cookies from sticking to the pan. Place your cookie dough on the silicone mat and bake as usual. When cookies are done, remove them from the mat and let them cool on a rack. The silicone baking mat can be washed and reused for future baking sessions. 3. Grease the pan with butter or cooking spray: This method involves applying a thin layer of grease to the pan, ensuring that it covers the entire surface. You can use either softened butter or a cooking spray specifically designed for baking purposes. Spread the butter on the surface of the pan with a brush, or for cooking spray, hold the can about 6 inches away from the pan and apply an even coating. Make sure to grease the corners and edges of the pan as well, as these tend to be areas where cookies may stick. 4. Apply a thin layer of flour: After greasing the pan, you can also add a thin layer of flour to create an additional barrier between the pan and the cookies. Simply add a small amount of flour to the greased pan, then tilt and tap the pan to spread the flour around and ensure it covers the entire surface. Shake off any excess flour before placing your cookie dough on the pan. 5. Use a non-stick pan: Non-stick baking pans are designed with a special coating that prevents food from sticking to their surface. To use a non-stick pan, you can simply place your cookie dough directly onto the pan and bake as per your recipe instructions. You may still want to lightly grease the pan or use a liner for added protection. 6. Properly space your cookies: When placing cookie dough on the baking sheet, ensure there is enough space between each portion to allow for expansion during baking. Overcrowding can cause cookies to merge together and stick to the pan or each other. Regardless of the method you choose, be sure to follow your recipe's instructions for baking time and temperature. Once your cookies have finished baking, allow them to cool on the pan for a few minutes before attempting to remove them. This will help to prevent breakage and further ensure that your cookies do not stick to the pan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how do former volcanoes affect hydrothermal activity Suggested answer: Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska photographed from the International Space Station , May 2006. Should I validate this answer? Available choices: (a). No (b). Yes","completion":"a. No The suggested answer does not provide a detailed and long explanation that addresses the question: how do former volcanoes affect hydrothermal activity. A more appropriate answer could be: Former volcanoes, also known as extinct volcanoes, can have a significant impact on hydrothermal activity. This is because the magma chamber, which is a reservoir of molten rock beneath the Earth's surface, may still contain heat even after the volcanic activity has ceased. This residual heat can contribute to the formation of hydrothermal systems, which include hot springs, geysers, fumaroles, and other geothermal features. Hydrothermal activity refers to the circulation of groundwater near the Earth's surface, which is heated by the magma chamber or other geothermal sources. When water percolates down through the Earth's surface and comes into contact with the hot rocks surrounding the magma chamber, it heats up, becomes less dense, and then rises towards the surface. As the water ascends, it may dissolve minerals and other substances from the rocks and carry them with it. In some cases, the heated water may reach the Earth's surface, forming hot springs or geysers. In other cases, the water may remain underground, but still exhibit signs of hydrothermal activity through the presence of an altered mineralogy in the rocks, termed hydrothermal alteration. Former volcanoes may support various types of hydrothermal systems depending on factors such as the depth of the magma chamber, the presence of permeable rocks, and the availability of water. Here are some ways in which former volcanoes can affect hydrothermal activity: 1. Heat source: The most obvious way in which former volcanoes can influence hydrothermal activity is by providing a heat source in the form of the residual heat from the magma chamber. This heat can drive the convection of water in the subsurface, leading to the development of hydrothermal systems. 2. Structural controls: Volcanic activity often creates fractures and other structural features in the Earth's crust, which can serve as conduits for the movement of water, steam, and gases. These features can help to focus and channel hydrothermal fluids, leading to the development of concentrated hydrothermal systems. 3. Mineral deposition: Hydrothermal fluids that are heated in the vicinity of former volcanoes may dissolve substantial amounts of minerals and other elements from the surrounding rocks. As the fluids cool down upon reaching the surface, these minerals can be deposited in the form of hydrothermal veins, forming valuable mineral deposits such as gold, copper, and other metals. In conclusion, former volcanoes can significantly influence hydrothermal activity by providing a heat source, creating structural pathways for fluid movement, and facilitating mineral deposition. The study of these hydrothermal systems in relation to former volcanoes can contribute to a better understanding of the Earth's geothermal processes, the formation of valuable mineral deposits, and the potential uses of geothermal energy for human benefit."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Magma collects in magma chambers beneath Earth’s surface.

Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- One of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's sons -- Saif al-Arab Gadhafi -- was killed after a NATO airstrike, a spokesman for Libya's government said Sunday at a press conference. Moammar Gadhafi and his wife were in their son's house when it was targeted, spokesman Musa Ibrahim said. Both of them are in good health, according to the spokesman. The victim is one of two Gadhafi sons whose names begin with Saif. The other is Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, who had previously touted reform but has emerged as one of his father's most visible defenders in recent months. A spokesman for the Libyan opposition doubted the veracity of the report of the son's death, saying, \\"In all honesty, we never heard of OPTIONS: - CNN until the start of the uprising.\\" - Gadhafi until the start of the uprising.\\" - Libya until the start of the uprising.\\" - Libyan until the start of the uprising.\\" - Moammar Gadhafi until the start of the uprising.\\" - Musa Ibrahim until the start of the uprising.\\" - NATO until the start of the uprising.\\" - Saif until the start of the uprising.\\" - Saif al-Arab Gadhafi until the start of the uprising.\\" - Saif al-Islam Gadhafi until the start of the uprising.\\" - Tripoli until the start of the uprising.\\"","completion":"- Saif al-Arab Gadhafi until the start of the uprising.\\" The correct ending for this story is that the spokesman for the Libyan opposition doubted the veracity of the report of Saif al-Arab Gadhafi's death until the start of the uprising.

The opening scenes set the traits of the three main characters. Mike is the no-nonsense, serious, but unassuming leader; Steven the loving, groom-to-be, pecked-at by his mother; and Nick the quiet, introspective man who loves deer hunting because, he likes \\"â¦the treesâ¦the way the trees are\\". The recurring theme of hunting with \\"one shot\\", which is how Mike prefers to take down a deer, is introduced. Before the trio ships out, Steven and his girlfriend Angela (Rutanya Alda), who is pregnant by another man, but loved by Steven nonetheless, marry in a Russian Orthodox wedding. In the meantime, Mike works to control his feelings for Nick's girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). At the wedding reception held at the local VFW hall, the guys drink, dance, sing, and enjoy the festivities, but then notice a soldier in a U.S. Army Special Forces uniform. Mike attempts to ask what Vietnam is like, but the soldier ignores him. After Mike explains that he, Steven, and Nick are going to Vietnam, the Green Beret raises his glass and says \\"fuck it\\".

Since June 2008 China has forbidden the production, sale and usage of plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeter , and retailers are not allowed to provide free plastic bags to their customers, no matter how thick they are. Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \\"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities. Street vendors worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them for plastic bags. Seeing no significance in the issue, local government often turn a blind eye to banned bag trade in the market. There are still those who don't have an interest in living green.

Sonora Webster lives with her sister and abusive aunt during the Great Depression. She learns that because of her accidentally letting the cows loose and her suspension from school, her treasured horse Lightning has been sold and she will be placed in an orphanage. Instead, Sonora slips out of the house during the night. She ends up at a county fair and sees a performance by Marie, a diving girl who rides a horse off a platform, and aspires to do the same. Doc Carver, Marie's employer, tells her she is too young but gives Sonora a job as a stable hand due to her ability with horses, and she begins traveling with them. Doc's son Al wins a wild horse in a card game and Sonora names him Lightning. She later surprises Doc by taming and riding Lightning, so he promises to train her as a diving girl if she can mount it while it's moving, which she succeeds after multiple attempts. Marie falls and dislocates her shoulder, leaving her unable to perform, and Sonora steps in. Although she has never dived with Lightning, their first jump is successful. Marie becomes jealous, and as Doc tires of her diva-like behavior, she quits rather than share billing with Sonora.

Mitch McConnell -- talking to a donor summit arranged by the Koch brothers, the Democrats' 2014 bogeymen. Democrats pushed \\"The Nation\\" story around online with frenetic glee. McConnell's Democratic challenger for his Kentucky seat, Alison Lundergan Grimes, couldn't wait to whack him on it, telling CNN in an exclusive interview that \\"Mitch McConnell got caught in his 47% Mitt Romney moment.\\" \\"I think it shows the extent and the lengths he will go to to pander to his party millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hurting Kentuckians,\\" Grimes told CNN. The problem with the Democrats' argument is that Romney's 47% moment was only a moment because he was saying to donors in private something he would never have dared to utter in public: \\"Forty-seven percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.

Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife.

The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

Here is a goal: How to Make Fried Chicken How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making fried chicken, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Gather ingredients and tools To make fried chicken, I would need the following ingredients: - Chicken pieces (legs, thighs, wings, or breasts) - Buttermilk or a mixture of milk and vinegar/lemon juice - All-purpose flour - Seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, etc.) - Cooking oil (vegetable, canola, or peanut oil) Additionally, I would need the following tools: - A large bowl or container for marinating - A shallow dish or plate for dredging - A deep-fryer, Dutch oven, or deep frying pan for cooking - A wire rack and baking sheet for draining - A thermometer to measure oil temperature and chicken doneness Step 2: Marinate the chicken In the large bowl or container, mix the buttermilk with a portion of the seasonings. Submerge the chicken pieces in the mixture, ensuring they are fully coated. Cover the container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours to allow the chicken to marinate. Step 3: Prepare the flour mixture In a shallow dish or plate, mix the all-purpose flour and the remaining seasonings. Set aside. Step 4: Prep for frying Before frying, prepare the wire rack and baking sheet for draining the cooked chicken. Set the wire rack on the baking sheet, allowing enough space for the oil to drip off. Preheat the oil in the deep-fryer, Dutch oven, or frying pan to a temperature of 350°F (175°C). Step 5: Dredge the chicken Remove the marinated chicken from the refrigerator. Working with one piece at a time, allow the excess buttermilk to drip off the chicken before placing it into the flour mixture. Coat the chicken with the flour mixture, pressing gently to ensure it adheres well, then shake off any excess flour. Set the breaded chicken aside on a clean plate for about 10 minutes to help the crust adhere better. Step 6: Fry the chicken Carefully lower the breaded chicken pieces into the hot oil using tongs or a frying spider. Do not overcrowd the pan; fry in batches if needed. Maintain the oil temperature around 325–350°F (163–177°C) and fry the chicken until golden brown and fully cooked, with the internal temperature reaching 165°F (74°C). This will usually take about 12-15 minutes for smaller pieces and 15-18 minutes for larger pieces. Step 7: Drain and serve Using tongs or a frying spider, carefully remove the cooked chicken from the hot oil and transfer it to the wire rack set on the baking sheet. Allow the chicken to drain and cool for a few minutes. Once all the chicken is fried and drained, serve hot with your favorite side dishes and enjoy your homemade fried chicken."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problema Icesave se referă la falimentul unei bănci islandeze și efectele sale asupra economiilor persoanelor care aveau conturi la acea bancă în Marea Britanie și Țările de Jos. În 2008, Landsbanki, o bancă din Islanda, a intrat în faliment din cauza crizei financiare mondiale, lăsând mii de clienți britanici și olandezi cu economiile lor în pericol. Guvernul islandez a acționat pentru a salva sistemul său bancar, dar nu a fost în măsură să ramburseze integral clienților din afara Islandei care au fost afectați de falimentul Landsbanki. Acest lucru a generat dispute între guvernele islandez, britanic și olandez cu privire la răspunderea și la ceea ce constituie un tratament corect pentru clienții străini ai unei bănci aflate în faliment. Discuțiile și negocierile între cele trei țări au continuat până în 2012, când Curtea Internațională a reglementat disputa în favoarea Islandei. Acest caz a pus sub semnul întrebării mecanismele de protecție a depozitelor și cooperarea internațională în domeniul financiar în timpul crizei economice. Problema macroului este legată de pescuitul excesiv și de managementul stocurilor de pește în apele islandeze și europene. Macroul este o specie de pește importantă pentru industria pescuitului, în special în țările nordice, precum Islanda, Norvegia, Feroe și Scoția. Începând cu 2010, s-au înregistrat creșteri ale capturilor de macrou, ducând la îngrijorări cu privire la sustenabilitatea acestui pește și impactul asupra ecosistemului marin în ansamblu. Pentru a aborda acest aspect, țările implicate în pescuitul macroului au căutat să ajungă la un acord cu privire la cote și practici de pescuit durabile, cu scopul de a proteja stocurile de macrou și menține viabilitatea industriei pescuitului. Această problemă a evidențiat dificultățile de a stabili politici și reglementări transfrontaliere pentru a se asigura că toate părțile contribuie la conservarea resurselor naturale și menținerea sănătății ecosistemelor. Rezolvarea ambelor probleme, Icesave și macroul, necesită cooperare internațională și respectul pentru interesele și nevoile tuturor părților implicate.

Write an article based on this summary: Newport Gwent Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones says the region needs more investment and strength in depth after two heavy Pro12 defeats.","completion":"Title: Newport Gwent Dragons Seek More Investment and Depth Following Pro12 Losses Introduction The Newport Gwent Dragons, a professional rugby team competing in the United Rugby Championship, have experienced a disappointing start to their season after suffering two heavy Pro12 defeats. In light of their recent performance, head coach Kingsley Jones has called for more investment and greater strength in depth to help turn the team's fortunes around. Understanding the Situation In recent weeks, the Newport Gwent Dragons have struggled to find form in their Pro12 matches. The team has not only suffered two significant defeats, but have also been unable to demonstrate the level of skill and gameplay needed to compete against the championship's top sides. As a result, head coach Kingsley Jones has made a public call for increased financial investment in the team, as well as the need for greater depth within the squad. Step 1: Assessing the Current Roster The first step to addressing the issue is evaluating the current roster and identifying areas where depth and talent can be improved. Kingsley Jones and his coaching staff will need to analyze each player's performance and their potential to contribute to the team's success in future games. By pinpointing weaknesses in the squad, they can focus on recruiting new players or strengthening the development of existing talents. Step 2: Attracting Additional Investment To bring about much-needed improvements in the team's overall performance, Kingsley Jones has stressed the necessity of increased investment. This financial backing would allow the Newport Gwent Dragons to acquire higher quality players, provide better training facilities, and hire experienced coaching staff. Having more resources to invest in the development of the team would undoubtedly make them more competitive within the Pro12 championship. Step 3: Partnering with Local Clubs and Organizations Creating strong connections with local clubs and organizations can potentially open doors for the Newport Gwent Dragons to access additional resources, contacts, and sponsorship opportunities. Engaging with the community may also help identify budding talents that can be nurtured and developed through partnerships, consequently improving the team's depth and enhancing public support. Step 4: Developing a Long-term Strategy Kingsley Jones and the Newport Gwent Dragons' management must develop a long-term strategy that combines the goals of acquiring more investment, enhancing the squad's depth, and improving the team's overall performance. This involves outlining a clear vision for the team's future and establishing achievable objectives. To sustain progress, regularly reviewing and adjusting the strategy can help keep the Newport Gwent Dragons on track for success. Conclusion The Newport Gwent Dragons, under the guidance of head coach Kingsley Jones, are now focusing on how to move forward after a disappointing start to their Pro12 season. By seeking more investment and focusing on developing depth within the squad, the team aims to make the necessary changes to recover their form and compete at a higher level within the championship. With a well-executed long-term strategy and financial backing, the Newport Gwent Dragons may soon find themselves back on the path to success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. soccer game B. capillaries C. ball D. animals E. person The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is A. Soccer game Soccer, also known as football in many countries, is a sport that generally does not involve the use of hands (except for the goalkeepers). In soccer, players use their feet, legs, and sometimes their heads to control, pass, and shoot the ball while attempting to score goals against their opponents. The aim of a soccer game is to score more goals than the opposing team within a specified time frame, usually 90 minutes, which is divided into two halves of 45 minutes each. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end, and the eleven players on each team work together to move the ball while preventing the opposition from scoring. Although soccer is a physical sport with a moderate level of contact, it is not typically characterized by bloodshed or violence. Players wear protective gear, such as shin guards, to minimize the risk of injury, and referees strictly enforce the rules to ensure fair play and player safety. However, accidents and injuries can still occur, particularly during aggressive plays or tackles. When players engage in prohibited behavior, such as intentional fouling or using their hands, they can be penalized with free kicks, penalty kicks, yellow cards, or even red cards and ejections from the game. In contrast to more violent or high-impact sports such as boxing, mixed martial arts, or rugby, soccer is less likely to result in bloodshed during gameplay. This element of the game has contributed to its worldwide popularity and appeal, as it is suitable for audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Overall, soccer is a sport that relies on skill, athleticism, teamwork, and strategy rather than brute force, making it a relatively low-risk option when it comes to potential bloodshed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"\\"Progress\\" is a general term that broadly refers to the development, advancement, or improvement of a particular aspect or entity over time. It could pertain to societal, economic, technological, scientific, or personal development. The concept of progress implies a positive change, signifying enhanced knowledge, capabilities, systems, or conditions, resulting in better overall outcomes in specific or multiple domains. For example, progress in science and technology has vastly improved the quality of human life by offering improved healthcare, communication, transportation, and other amenities. Societal progress includes advancements in human rights, gender equality, and access to education, among other aspects. \\"Progression testing\\" is a specific term used in the field of software testing. It refers to testing the software after modifications have been made, to ensure that newly added or changed features function properly and that no negative impacts have been introduced to the existing software system. Progression testing is an essential part of the software development lifecycle since it ensures that new or modified features have not introduced defects or issues that may compromise the overall functionality or usability of the software. In progression testing, testers typically execute test cases that are relevant to the new functionality or changes made in the software. The primary goal is to evaluate the quality and accuracy of the new features while ensuring that pre-existing features still work as intended. Additionally, regression testing is often conducted alongside progression testing to further verify that no adverse effects were introduced to the existing software system. In summary, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. While \\"progress\\" is a general term that can be applied to many domains, \\"progression testing\\" is a specific type of software testing focused on ensuring that newly added or changed features work correctly and do not negatively impact the pre-existing functionality of the software.

First, we have a math problem that looks like this: 0 = 57x + 50x + 49x - 159x - 153 The first thing we need to do is add and subtract the terms with \\"x\\" in them. So, let's combine the \\"x\\" terms: 57x + 50x + 49x - 159x Now we'll add and subtract the numbers: 57 + 50 + 49 - 159 = -3 So now our equation looks like this: 0 = -3x - 153 Next, we want to get rid of the -153. We can do this by adding 153 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 153 = -3x - 153 + 153 This simplifies to: 153 = -3x Now, we want to find out what \\"x\\" is.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. Question: Why did Trump meet with Trudeau? Options: A.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: After buying products, reading the manual enables what? Possible A: understand details, being able to use, loss of money, economic boom, spending money Why is \\"being able to use\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Being able to use\\" an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the practical benefits of reading a product manual. When people purchase products, their primary goal is often to use the item as intended or gain the maximum value from it. Reading the manual ensures that they become aware of the product's features, how to operate it correctly, and how to maintain it properly, which are critical aspects of using any product. This understanding allows them to enjoy the benefits that the product offers effectively and safely. Comparatively, the other possible answers provided, such as \\"understand details,\\" do hold some relevance. However, they do not focus on the end goal of using the product. While understanding the details of a product is essential, that understanding becomes truly valuable only when it is applied to using and benefiting from the product. Therefore, \\"being able to use\\" is more aligned with human common sense because it emphasizes practical usage. People are more concerned with how knowledge and understanding translate into the actual operation of the product. Similarly, \\"loss of money,\\" \\"economic boom,\\" and \\"spending money\\" are not directly related to the primary purpose of reading a product manual. These answers may touch upon general financial and economic aspects, but they do not address the immediate benefits of reading a manual in terms of understanding and product usage. They also do not correspond to why someone would want to read a manual after buying a product, which is mainly to learn how to use it effectively. Therefore, \\"being able to use\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense as it reflects the logical and practical reasons consumers have for reading product manuals. Consumers want to gain the knowledge required to use their purchase safely and efficiently and to get the most value out of their investment. In this context, \\"being able to use\\" is the most fitting answer in terms of real-world utility and relevance to the question posed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In order to do that, we will add 4*z to both sides of the equation: -8*z + 4*z = -4*z + 4*z This simplifies to: -4*z = 0 Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of z to solve for z. The coefficient of z in -4*z is -4. To isolate z, we will divide both sides of the equation by -4: (-4*z) / (-4) = 0 / (-4) This simplifies to: z = 0 So, the solution for the equation -4*z - 4*z = -4*z is z = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

Nonetheless, news of the giant lobster caught the attention of several diners in the area, Melluso said, adding that one gentleman bought and reserved it for a family dinner on Tuesday evening at the Tin Fish restaurant. But just before Larry could be cooked, several animal activists called Melluso, asking him if they could save the lobster and just reimburse the gentleman who originally bought it. \\"They really opened up my eyes and it got me a little emotional,\\" Melluso said. \\"We went ahead and donated the lobster to them.\\" And so rather than being put into a pot, the lobster was put into a special container with salt water to be shipped to Maine, according to Brooke Estren, an attorney based in Boca Raton who coordinated the rescue and named the lobster Larry.

Barney is passionate about engineering and the law, and between his varied studies, football, and the fraternity, he neglects his girl friend Amber. In the next term, Mondrake gives his class sweater to Barney's sister Barbara. His drinking problem intensifies, however, when he learns that Barbara is falling in love with Professor Danvers, the singing drama teacher. When Mondrake fails to show up at an important football game against a rival university, Danvers finds him in jail. With the school's reputation at stake, Danvers has him released and takes him to the football field in time to play in the game. Afterwards, Danvers is called before the college president. Although rivals for Barbara's affections, Danvers stands up for Mondrake. The college president expels Mondrake for drunkenness and forces Danvers to resign because of his involvement in the matter. Feeling guilty over causing Mondrake's expulsion, Barbara proposes marriage to him. Later, however, she admits that she is not in love with him, but with Danvers. Mondrake bows out of the relationship, and Barbara rushes to Danvers' side before he leaves. During the next term, Barney has followed Mondrake's example and taken up drinking and smoking, which is not appealing to Amber. At the big football game, Barney is in sorry shape. Mid West is losing until he receives inspiration from Tex, who has returned to watch the game. After being knocked out, Barney recovers and wins the game for Mid West.

Isolate the h terms by moving all terms containing h to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side. The equation is initially: 9*h - 64 = -7*h 2. We will now add 7*h to both sides of the equation to move the -7*h term to the left side of the equation: 9*h + 7*h - 64 = -7*h + 7*h Simplifying, we get: 16*h - 64 = 0 3. Now, let's isolate h by moving the constant term, -64, to the right side of the equation. We do this by adding 64 to both sides: 16*h - 64 + 64 = 0 + 64 Simplifying, we get: 16*h = 64 4. To solve for h, we will now divide both sides of the equation by 16: 16*h / 16 = 64 / 16 Simplifying, we get: h = 4 Thus, the solution for the given equation 9*h - 64 = -7*h is h = 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Epicurus (or \\"ally, comrade\\"; 341270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher as well as the founder of the school of philosophy called Epicureanism. Only a few fragments and letters of Epicurus's 300 written works remain. Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators. - Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Following Aristippusabout whom very little is knownEpicurus believed that what he called \\"pleasure\\" was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one's desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility (\\"ataraxia\\") and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain (\\"aponia\\"). The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \\"hedonism\\" as it is colloquially understood. - Themista of Lampsacus , the wife of Leonteus , was a student of Epicurus , early in the 3rd century BCE . Epicurus ' school was unusual in the 3rd century , in that it allowed women to attend , and we also hear of Leontion attending Epicurus ' school around the same time .

Arithmetic: Return the difference between the end date and the start date of #1 in days 3. Arithmetic: Return the result of #2 divided by 30.44 (average days in a month) 4. Aggregate: Return the rounded value of #3 as the number of months Now, let's execute these steps: 1. Select step - We need to know the start date and end date of the conflict. For example, let's say the conflict started on January 1, 2020, and ended on June 15, 2020. 2. Arithmetic step - Calculate the difference between the end date (June 15, 2020) and the start date (January 1, 2020) in days. The difference is 166 days. 3. Arithmetic step - Calculate the result of the difference (166 days) divided by the average number of days in a month (30.44). 166 / 30.44 = 5.45 4. Aggregate step - Round the value of the result from step 3 (5.45) to get the number of months.

On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"It would be like people saving just for their communities\\" points towards a collective effort where individuals contribute their savings for the welfare and betterment of the entire community. This reflects a communal or collective mindset that prioritizes the well-being of the group over that of individual members.

When government agents appear on the scene, they flee in their spaceship, leaving one of their own behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old fatherless boy named Elliot, is trying to spend time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The creature promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliot leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the creature to his bedroom. Before he goes to sleep, he realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving a dead chrysanthemum.At school the next day, Elliot begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches John Wayne hug Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man on TV, Elliot hugs and kisses a girl he likes. He is then sent to the principal's office.Makeshift communicator used by E.T. to phone home.

Michael notices that his health is declining and that Elliot is referring to himself as \\"we.\\"On Halloween, Michael and Elliot dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. Elliot and E.T. ride the former's bike to the forest, where E.T. makes a successful call home. The next morning, Elliot wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone, so he returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes him home to Elliot, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying E.T., just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a medical facility there, quarantining Elliot and E.T. Their link disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliot recovers. A grief-stricken Elliot is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliot and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Steve's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bike.

Context: In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).","completion":"In the 9th year of the 20th century, which is 1909, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder.

Write an article with the title: \\"Lin, Knicks will face major test against Heat\\"","completion":"Title: Lin, Knicks will Face Major Test against Heat Jeremy Lin and the New York Knicks prepared themselves for one of their most challenging games of the season as they were scheduled to face the Miami Heat. The Heat, powered by the trio of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, presented a formidable challenge to Lin and the rest of the Knicks squad. The upcoming game tested the mettle of both Lin and the team, proving whether the Knicks were ready to make their statement in the league as true competitors. In the weeks leading up to the game, Lin took the NBA by storm, rising from obscurity to international superstardom thanks to a string of incredible performances. This sudden surge in success and popularity, later dubbed as \\"Linsanity,\\" not only revitalized interest in the Knicks franchise but also impressed basketball fans and analysts around the world. Lin's exceptional talent as a point guard enabled him to make his teammates better while simultaneously creating scoring opportunities for himself. As the day of the showdown with the Heat approached, Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni devised a game plan designed to exploit Miami's weaknesses and capitalize on Lin's strengths. For the Knicks to come out victorious, Lin needed to continue his hot streak and navigate the Heat's stifling defense, which was known to be one of the best in the league. One of the crucial aspects of the matchup was the battle between Lin and Miami's point guard, Mario Chalmers. Chalmers' quick hands and tenacious defense would present a significant challenge for Lin, who needed to remain poised and focused in the face of intense ball pressure. Additionally, the Knicks needed to rely on their role players like Landry Fields, Iman Shumpert, and Steve Novak to step up and provide valuable contributions on both ends of the court. Alongside the individual matchups and team strategy, an important factor in this game was the psychological element. The Knicks went into the contest as the underdogs, with the pressure to maintain the momentum from their recent success. Lin, thrust into the national spotlight, would face scrutiny from the media and fans if he faltered against the all-powerful Miami Heat. On the other hand, the Heat, as one of the league's premier franchises, had to prove that they could put a halt to Linsanity and maintain their status as championship contenders. Unsurprisingly, the game attracted a huge amount of media attention, with both teams fully aware that the eyes of the basketball world were upon them. As the players took to the court for the opening tip-off, the intensity in the arena was palpable. The game itself was a hard-fought encounter, characterized by tenacious defense, thrilling fast breaks, and high-pressure clutch moments. Lin, rising to the occasion, demonstrated his exceptional court vision and ability to create scoring opportunities for his teammates, while also finding ways to contribute offensively. Facing off against the likes of James, Wade, and Bosh, the Knicks displayed their grit and determination, never backing down from the challenge. The game went back and forth, with both teams exchanging leads and momentum, but ultimately, it came down to the final minutes, where every possession mattered even more. As the clock wound down, the game's outcome hung in the balance, with both teams showcasing their resilience, mental strength, and will to win. Regardless of the final score, it was clear that this showdown between Lin and the Heat would be remembered as an epic battle, solidifying Linsanity's place in NBA history and proving that the New York Knicks were a force to be reckoned with."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: People Born in Autumn Live Longer People born in the autumn live longer than those born in the spring and are less likely to fall chronically ill when they are older, according to an Austrian scientist. Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \\"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \\"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone to infections of the digestive system.\\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well.

He had been valued at less than £5m when he left as a makeweight in a deal for defender David Luiz in January 2011, two years after he first joined the Blues in a £1.5m move from Slovakian club MFK Kosice. Matic scored once in 35 Premier League appearances during Chelsea's title-winning 2016-17 season, also striking spectacularly in their FA Cup semi-final victory over Tottenham in April. His exit had been expected after the Blues signed France international Tiemoue Bakayoko, 22, from French champions Monaco in a reported £40m deal earlier in July. Italian champions Juventus were also understood to be keen on Matic. In 2015, Matic was named in the PFA's Premier League team of the year, along with five other players from Chelsea's title-winning team. According to Opta, he averaged nearly four tackles, made more than two interceptions and won eight duels - a 50-50 contest - per 90 minutes over the 2014-15 campaign. However, last season Matic won only 278 duels, at an average of 4.77. Last season, while Chelsea team-mate N'Golo Kante made an average of 3.64 tackles per 90 minutes - the fourth highest in the Premier League behind Liverpool's Jordan Henderson, Leicester's Wilfred Ndidi and Idrissa Gueye of Everton - Matic managed only 1.7. The deal for Matic brings United's summer spending to £146m. Almost £900m has been spent by Premier League sides so far in the summer transfer window, which closes on 31 August, and accountancy firm Deloitte predicts top-flight clubs will surpass the record £1.165bn they spent last summer. Manchester City took their spending beyond the £200m mark by signing Monaco left-back Benjamin Mendy on Monday, while Chelsea have also spent more than £100m. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The 28-year-old Serbian midfielder, previously with Chelsea, has now joined Manchester United, marking United's third major purchase of the summer following the arrivals of defender Victor Lindelof from Benfica for £31m and striker Romelu Lukaku from Everton for £75m. United's manager, Jose Mourinho, has expressed satisfaction with the acquisition of Matic, citing his key attributes as \\"loyalty, consistency, ambition\\". With appreciation for his time at Chelsea, Matic is eager for the new opportunity to continue his work with Mourinho and integrate with his new teammates. Previously, Mourinho had spent £21m in 2014 to sign Matic from Benfica during his time as Chelsea manager. Matic had been valued at under £5m when he previously left Chelsea in a deal involving David Luiz in 2011, after first joining Chelsea in a £1.5m transfer from the Slovakian club MFK Kosice. Despite Matic's solid performance, his exit from Chelsea has not come as a surprise after the club signed Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco for an alleged £40m in early July. Matic's strong performances won him a spot on the PFA's Premier League team of the year in 2015. However, his performances saw a slight drop in the 2016-2017 season, winning only 278 duels with an average of 4.77, in contrast with Chelsea teammate, N'Golo Kante, who made an average of 3.64 tackles per 90 minutes. Manchester United's complete summer spending has now reached £146m. Thus far during the summer transfer window, Premier League teams have spent almost £900m combined. It is predicted by accountancy firm Deloitte that clubs will surpass the previous summer's expenditure record of £1.165bn by the window's close on August 31. Furthermore, club Chelsea has spent over £100m and Manchester City has exceeded £200m in player transfers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To wine makers, stink bugs are more than a nuisance. These tiny pests can hitch rides on grapes going through the wine making process, releasing stress compounds that can foul the smell and taste of the finished product. Now, in a study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, scientists report the threshold of stink bugs per grape cluster that will impact the integrity of the wine. In vineyards, brown marmorated stink bugs feed on grapes, reducing their yield and quality. And because they are small and blend in, the insects hitchhike on the grapes and wind up in the winery, giving off stress compounds that sometimes affecting the quality of the wine and juice. Pesticides used in the vineyard are not completely effective, so attention is being focused on ways to reduce the presence of the insects in wineries post-harvest. To find out exactly how grape processing impacts the release of stink bug stress compounds and how this affects wine, Elizabeth Tomasino and colleagues took a closer look. The researchers placed varying numbers of live or dead stink bugs on grapes and measured the release of insect stress compounds as wine was produced from the fruits. They found that pressing was a key step in the release of two of the most common stress compounds -- tridecane, which is odorless, and (E)-2-decenal, which produces an undesirable musty-like, coriander or cilantro aroma. Interestingly, white wine was contaminated less often than red. The researchers suggest that this is because these two wines are pressed at different points in the winemaking process. The team concludes that if winemakers could limit stink bugs to no more than three per grape cluster, the levels of tridecane and (E)-2-decenal in wine would be below the consumer rejection threshold. # The authors acknowledge funding from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Northwest Center for Small Fruits Research.

Follow us: Twitter ||||| There are two kinds of people in the world: Those who eat bugs knowingly and those who eat bugs unknowingly. Oh yes, you eat bugs. Even vegans eat bugs. While farmers and food processors want our grub to be pure, it is impossible to eliminate every single contaminant in the food supply. Crops are covered with insects, and little can be done to prevent a leg here or an antenna there from making its way into the final product. The FDA is fully aware of this and even has a handbook that describes the allowable level of food \\"defects.\\" Peanut butter, for example, can have up to 30 insect fragments per 3.5 ounces. Wine, too, is not immune to this nuisance. Brown marmorated stink bugs, which came to North America from Asia in the mid-1900s, are fond of fruit such as grapes. During winemaking, the critters become stressed (being squashed tends to do that), and the stink bugs live up to their name by producing a compound called trans-2-decenal (T2D). For white wines T2D isn't a problem, possibly because the chemical is modified during winemaking. But T2D is potentially troublesome for red wines, particularly pinot noir, which normally does not contain any T2D. So a team of researchers led by Elizabeth Tomasino from Oregon State University set about determining how stink bugs affected the perception of wine. The scientists made their own wine, and tossed in a few stink bugs for added flavor. They discovered that a density of three stink bugs per grape cluster yielded wine with a T2D concentration of 2 μg/L. That's tiny, but it's enough to be detected by consumers. In a previous study, the team found that some wine tasters could sense T2D at a concentration as low as 0.5 μg/L, though most needed a concentration roughly ten times that level. Interestingly, the volunteers' responses differed; some people liked T2D, while others found it appalling. This isn't a surprise, given that T2D is also found in cilantro. People's preferences for the aroma may come down to culture, genetics, or a combination of the two. The invasive brown marmorated stink bug appears to be spreading across America. For vintners to maintain consistency, they must take measures to limit the number of stink bugs feasting on their grapes. On the other hand, for customers who enjoy cilantro, a special stink bug-infused Two Buck Chuck could be on the menu. Sources (1) Pallavi Mohekar, Trina J. Lapis, Nik G.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who turned to musical journalism after a failed student career in Oxford and London?, using the article: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand., what would be the answer ?

The HUD has conducted a long campaign to make public housing - known as council housing in the UK - smoke-free. In 2009, it began pressing the US's more than 3,100 public housing agencies to make their properties smoke-free. At the moment, over 228,000 public housing units have smoking bans.

His sentiments were echoed by the US surgeon general, who shared his concerns about second-hand smoke.

Their parents loved them both equally. Which brother had an extra complete chromosome 21? Hint: One of the most common chromosome abnormalities is Down syndrome , due to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 resulting in an extra complete chromosome 21, or part of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ). Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy where an affected individual may survive to adulthood. Individuals with Down syndrome often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance. With proper assistance, individuals with Down syndrome can become successful, contributing members of society. The incidence of Down syndrome increases with maternal age. The risk of having a child with Down syndrome is significantly higher among women age 35 and older. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is Ian, the brother with Down syndrome, who has an extra complete chromosome 21. Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, either in whole or in part. This additional chromosome results from a process called nondisjunction, which occurs when chromosome 21 fails to separate properly during the formation of an egg or sperm cell. Down syndrome is characterized by a range of physical and cognitive features. Common physical traits include distinct facial features, such as a flattened face, upward-slanting eyes, and a short neck. Individuals with Down syndrome may also experience growth delays, low muscle tone, and an increased risk of certain medical conditions like heart defects, hearing problems, vision issues, and thyroid disorders. Cognitive development is typically impacted in individuals with Down syndrome, often leading to some degree of intellectual disability. However, the severity of these cognitive impairments can vary widely from person to person. With appropriate support and resources, individuals with Down syndrome can develop important skills, form meaningful relationships, and lead fulfilling lives as contributing members of society. It is notable that the incidence of having a child with Down syndrome tends to increase with the mother's age, particularly with women who are 35 years old or above. This higher risk is potentially attributable to changes in the egg, particularly in the meiotic spindle, which plays a crucial role in chromosome segregation. This age-related perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding and monitoring potential genetic risks during family planning and prenatal care. In summary, Ian, the brother with Down syndrome, is the one with an extra complete chromosome 21. This genetic abnormality results from a nondisjunction event involving chromosome 21 during the formation of egg or sperm cells. Despite the challenges faced by individuals with Down syndrome, with proper support and resources, they can overcome many obstacles and lead fulfilling lives."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

While there, her colleague Birdie (Ainsley Howard) helps her to clean the toilets. The two begin to talk and Lena reveals that she lives alone and doesn't keep in touch with her family. Birdie introduces Lena to her adopted brother Elbie (Toby Alexander), who also works at the airport and is a mute. Lena tells Birdie that she doesn't get on with her family. While talking Lena notices scars on Birdie's arm, Birdie explains that she used to have behavioral problems; but that she's better now. At the end of the shift Lena misses her bus so Birdie tells her that her dad will drive Lena home if they walk to Birdie's house. Upon arriving at the house Lena is knocked out from behind and injected with a syringe. She wakes up tied to a chair to the sound of screaming coming from another room. Moments later Mum (Dido Miles) and Dad (Perry Benson) enter the room and introduce themselves. Mum tells Lena that if she does what she is told everything will be ok. Lena is unable to respond because of the injection she received earlier and Mum proceeds to inject her with a sedative. When she wakes up again Mum begins carving marks into her back. Lena is unable to speak, and Mum tells her to not try to talk. (Because she has had a little jab.) She gives Lena another injection, and Lena falls asleep. She wakes up later, tied to a frame.

The shape of a dragonfly. A:","completion":"Title: The Dragonfly Prophecy Genre: Fantasy/Adventure Plot: In the magical land of Elaris, various kingdoms lived in harmony, maintaining a delicate balance of power. This peace, however, was threatened by an ancient prophecy, one which spoke of an exceptional child born with a birthmark in the shape of a dragonfly. This child, according to the prophecy, would wield unimaginable power, possessing the abilities to commune with all elements and creatures. As the foretold Chosen One, the bearer of the dragonfly mark would have the potential to either save or doom the realm. When baby Adalyn was born with the dragonfly-shaped birthmark, the small village in the peaceful Kingdom of Arden was suddenly thrust into the spotlight. The kingdom's wise Queen Nevara, curious about the legendary prophecy, instructed her advisors to investigate the veracity of the prophecy and to ensure Adalyn's protection. As word spread about Adalyn's birthmark, tension arose amongst the other kingdoms. Some saw her as a symbol of hope and a means to bring unity to the realm, while others viewed her as a potential weapon or an unstoppable force posed to destroy them all. The leaders of these opposing factions began plotting, hoping to leverage Adalyn's powers for their own interests. When Adalyn turned ten, her latent powers started to manifest. It soon became apparent that she required guidance to safely learn how to use her abilities. Queen Nevara decided to send her to the secret Elemental Academy, where she could be trained by masters in each elemental discipline. While at the academy, Adalyn witnessed the simmering conflicts amongst the kingdoms that threatened Elaris. As her powers grew stronger, the young girl struggled with the gravity of her destiny. The academy's elders realized that the key to understanding Adalyn's fate lay within the dragonflies themselves, legendary creatures believed to be the guardians of the realm's balance. To unlock the mystery, Adalyn embarked on a journey across Elaris to connect with five ancient dragonflies, who according to legend, held the secrets to her destiny. Accompanied by her loyal friends and a skilled warrior tasked with her protection, Adalyn faced numerous challenges and perils on her quest—rogue factions, enchanted creatures, and the treacherous forces of nature. As Adalyn found each dragonfly, she uncovered a connection with the true essence of her powers and received the wisdom to mend the fractures within the realm. Eventually, she discovered the prophecy's true meaning: her destiny was to help unite the realm by embracing and fostering diplomacy, rather than wielding her powers as a weapon of destruction. As the kingdoms rallied behind her, Adalyn used her newfound wisdom and her ability to connect with all elements and creatures to restore harmony, ultimately thwarting the power-hungry factions that sought to exploit her abilities. The Dragonfly Prophecy embraced a message of hope, unity, and balance, showcasing that the true power of the Chosen One came not from her elemental control, but from her ability to forge alliances and promote peace across the realm of Elaris."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"If Jimbo increases the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the energy carried by that soundwave will decrease. This is because waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy, as stated in the assumption. When the wavelength of a soundwave increases, its frequency decreases, since the speed of sound remains constant in a given medium. According to the equation for the energy of a wave: Energy ∝ Frequency² An inverse relationship exists between energy and wavelength. As the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases, resulting in a decrease in the energy carried by the soundwave.

Oscar Palmer Robertson (born November 24, 1938), nicknamed \\"The Big O\\", is an American former National Basketball Association player who played for the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks. The 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m), 205 lb (93 kg) Robertson played point guard and was a 12-time All-Star, 11-time member of the All-NBA Team, and one-time winner of the MVP award in 14 professional seasons. In 1962, he became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season. In the 1970-71 NBA season, he was a key player on the team that brought the Bucks their only NBA title. Prior to the 1970-71 season, the Royals stunned the basketball world by trading Robertson to the Bucks for Flynn Robinson and Charlie Paulk. No reasons were officially given, but many pundits suspected head coach Bob Cousy was jealous of all the attention Robertson was getting. Robertson himself said: \\"I think he was wrong and I will never forget it.\\" The relationship between Oscar and the Royals had soured to the point that Cincinnati had also approached the Lakers and Knicks about deals involving their star player (the Knicks players who were discussed in those scenarios are unknown, but Los Angeles stated publicly that the Royals asked about Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain, with the Lakers saying they would not consider trading either star). However, the trade proved highly beneficial for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team the last six years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, the Bucks charged to a league-best 66-16 record, including a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12-2 record in the playoffs, and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4-0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. For the first time in his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship. From a historical perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made not on a basketball court, but rather in a court of law. It was the year of the landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, an antitrust suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA-NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players. On the hardwood, the veteran Robertson still proved he was a valuable player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the 1971-72 and 1972-73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59-23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson had the chance to end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the Bucks lost in seven games. As a testament to Robertson's importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38-44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar. Robertson was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995.

His father was Max Ziser (1874-1946) and his mother was Ida (nee Raphael) (1887-1975). They likely were from Dabrowa Tarnowska, Poland. Reports state that the surname \\"Caesar\\" was given to Max, as a child, by an immigration official at Ellis Island. Caesar's television career began with an appearance on Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater in the fall of 1948. In early 1949, Caesar and Liebman met with Pat Weaver, vice president of television at NBC, which led to Caesar's first series, Admiral Broadway Revue with Imogene Coca. The Friday show was simultaneously broadcast on NBC and the DuMont network, and was an immediate success. However, its sponsor, Admiral, an appliance company, could not keep up with the demand for its new television sets, so the show was cancelled after 26 weeks--ironically, on account of its runaway success. On February 25, 1950, Caesar appeared in the first episode of Your Show of Shows, initially the second half of the two-hour umbrella show, Saturday Night Review; at the end of the 1950-51 season, Your Show of Shows became its own, 90-minute program from the Interntional Theatre at 5 Columbus Circle and later The Center Theatre at Sixth Avenue and 49th Street. Burgess Meredith hosted the first two shows, and the premiere featured musical guests Gertrude Lawrence, Lily Pons and Robert Merrill. The show was a mix of sketch comedy, movie and television satires, Caesar's monologues, musical guests, and large production numbers. Guests included: Jackie Cooper, Robert Preston, Rex Harrison, Eddie Albert, Michael Redgrave, Basil Rathbone, Charlton Heston, Geraldine Page, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Pearl Bailey, Fred Allen, Benny Goodman, Lena Horne and many other stars of the time. It was also responsible for bringing together the comedy team of Caesar, Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris. Many writers also got their break creating the show's sketches, including Lucille Kallen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin and Sheldon Keller. Sid Caesar won his first Emmy in 1952. In 1951 and 1952, he was voted the United States' Best Comedian in Motion Picture Daily's TV poll. The show ended after almost 160 episodes on June 5, 1954. A few months later, Caesar returned with Caesar's Hour, a one-hour sketch/variety show with Morris, Reiner, Bea Arthur and other members of his former crew. Nanette Fabray replaced Coca, who had left to star in her own short-lived series. Ultimate creative and technical control was now in Caesar's hands, originating from the Century Theater and the weekly budget doubled to 125,000. The premiere on September 27, 1954, featured Gina Lollobrigida. Everything was performed live, including the commercials. Caesar's Hour was followed by ABC's short-lived Sid Caesar Invites You from January 26 to May 25, 1958. It briefly reunited Caesar, Coca, and Reiner, with Simon and Brooks among the writers. In 1963, Caesar appeared on television, on stage, and in the movies. Several As Caesar Sees It specials evolved into the 1963-64 Sid Caesar Show (which alternated with Edie Adams in Here's Edie). He starred with Virginia Martin in the Broadway musical Little Me, with book by Simon, choreography by Bob Fosse, and music by Cy Coleman. Playing eight parts with 32 costume changes, he was nominated in 1963 for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. On film, Caesar and Adams played a husband and wife drawn into a mad race to find buried loot in the 1963 comedy extravaganza It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

David Huxley is a mild-mannered paleontologist. For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained young lady unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents. Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\". Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage. David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be potential donor Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zoo and, mistaking a dangerous leopard (also portrayed by Nissa) from a nearby circus for Baby, let it out of its cage.

Green A:","completion":"Title: The Green Gambit Genre: Crime drama, Thriller The film begins with Detective Jack Fowler, a seasoned investigator notorious for his unorthodox methods, standing in the office of his superior, Sergeant Green. Green hands him a letter from the top brass, ordering Fowler to turn in his badge and gun immediately. Fowler is taken aback, convinced that he's being made a scapegoat for someone else's transgressions. Frustrated and feeling betrayed, Jack resolves to uncover who's behind his suspension. He starts to delve deeper into his previous cases, suspecting an old enemy might be trying to settle the score. Along the way, he enlists the assistance of his longtime friend and informant, Wesley, a streetwise informant with a knack for gathering clandestine information. Their first lead points them to the high-profile trial of a mob boss named Leonardo \\"The Butcher\\" Vittorio. Months prior, Fowler was crucial in securing evidence that led to The Butcher's arrest. He sees this as an opportunity to potentially get revenge on the man responsible for framing him. While surveilling key associates in The Butcher's crime family, Fowler notices a link between them and a seemingly untouchable billionaire named Cedric Cahill. As they delve deeper into Cahill's background and his unusual connections, Fowler and Wesley find evidence of a far-reaching conspiracy, one that connects the criminal underworld with the highest echelons of political power. Struggling to stay ahead of the hitmen sent to silence him, Fowler uncovers a secret meeting between Cahill and Sergeant Green. He realizes that Green might be a double agent, working for Cahill and betraying Fowler to protect his own reputation and maintain his double life. Unsure of who he can trust, Fowler enlists the aid of a tenacious journalist, Lauren Faye, with whom he's crossed paths in the past. Lauren has been working on exposing corruption within the city's administration and is eager to help Fowler bring down Cahill and his political cronies, who she believes are responsible for a sinister plot to further their own agendas. The movie's climax takes place during a tense confrontation as Fowler, Wesley, and Lauren stand off against Cahill, The Butcher, and Green as they attempt to expose the conspiracy publicly. They crash a lavish fundraising gala attended by key figures connected to the plot, leading to a high-stakes action sequence, complete with shootouts and close calls. After the trio successfully reveals the damning evidence against Cahill and Green, and with the help of Fowler's former comrades in blue, they manage to subdue the villains and bring them to justice. The film ends with a somber yet satisfying resolution. Sergeant Green is arrested for his misconduct and Cahill and The Butcher are brought to trial. Fowler's reputation is restored, and he is offered his old job back. However, given the corruption he's witnessed, he decides to leave the force and team up with both Lauren and Wesley to become a private investigator, vowing to continue seeking justice for those who have been wronged. The Green Gambit is a riveting exploration of personal loyalty, systemic corruption, and the need for individuals to stand up for what is right, even in the face of insurmountable odds. The film emphasizes the importance of trust, compromise, and redemption, leaving audiences with an appreciation for the complexities of justice and the human spirit."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Beef A:","completion":"Title: \\"The Pillars of Glam: A Beef Odyssey\\" BACKGROUND: The film unravels in the neon-soaked landscape of the late 1970s - an era defined by its outrageous fashion, soul-stirring music, and the unabashed celebration of all things fames and hedonism. Against the backdrop of this wild world, the story revolves around 'Beef,' a male glam rock Prima Donna, whose unquenchable thirst for self-expression takes him to the top of the charts and ultimately down a twisted path of self-destruction. PLOT: The story begins with a young and passionate musician named Brian Eustace Forrester, whose one true dream is the make it big in the fantastical world of glam rock. Grotesque wigs and outlandish costumes hold an undeniable charm for the starry-eyed artist seeking a place to belong, and Brian is no exception to this allure. After breaking away from his oppressive Midwestern family to pursue his dreams in the big-city, Brian meets the sharp-witted and spunky stylist, Ziggy, who convinces him that the key to success lies in the strength of a persona. Together, Brian and Ziggy create 'Beef' - a pill popping, unstoppable force of glitter, leather, and eyeshadow who is destined to take the world by storm. Fuelled by Ziggy's ingenious design, swaths of hairspray, and an unquenchable hunger for attention, Beef's rise in the rock scene is meteoric. Going from playing dingy underground clubs to sold-out arenas, Beef is at the top of his game. Radio waves are constantly humming with his anthemic, catchy tunes, and the more popular he becomes, the more enigmatic and outrageous his persona evolves. However, beneath the shimmering surface of Beef's life, dark cracks begin to form. Struggling to separate his identity from his larger-than-life persona, Beef follows a pattern of self-destruction. He forms tumultuous relationships, battles a growing addiction to prescription pills, and suffers from a splintering psyche that threatens to dismantle everything he's worked so hard to build. The climax of the film unfolds when Beef, at the peak of his fame, experiences a pivotal breakdown on stage. In front of thousands, a tear-stained and mascara-smudged Beef stumbles through a garbled performance and ultimately collapses to the floor. In the aftermath of the public meltdown, Beef enters rehabilitation, where he confronts the underlying issues that have haunted him throughout his rise to the top. Along with the help of strong support from Ziggy, a music therapist named Melody, and a myriad of eccentric fellow patients, Beef embarks upon a path of self-discovery. As he rebuilds his life, he grapples with whether hiding behind a persona as LED-clad armor is worth the cost of his physical and mental well-being. The film concludes on a bittersweet note as Beef, now embracing his true self, makes a triumphant return to the stage as Brian Eustace Forrester. His music is raw and honest, shedding light on the trials and tribulations that brought him to the precipice of success, self-destruction, and finally, healing. As the credits roll, the film leaves audiences with a poignant reflection on the consequences of untenable fame and the incredible strength that can be harnessed when one rises from the ashes to embrace their inherent, unvarnished truth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are related to different aspects of Infosys and pursuing higher education. Let me address each question separately: 1. Do we get an opportunity to do MS after Infosys training? Infosys training typically refers to the training program provided by Infosys to its new recruits, commonly known as the Infosys Global Education Centre or Infosys Mysore training. Usually, employees undergo this comprehensive training program before being placed at one of the company's facilities to work on client projects. Now, regarding the opportunity to pursue an MS (Master of Science) degree after this training, it is essential to understand that the purpose of the Infosys training is to train professionals for the IT industry, while an MS is an academic degree. They serve different objectives, but that doesn't mean you cannot pursue an MS after Infosys training. If you are interested in a higher education degree, you have several options: A. You can enroll in a part-time or online MS program during your employment with Infosys or any other organization. Many institutions offer these flexible study options that can be pursued alongside a full-time job. B. You can choose to take a break from work and pursue a full-time MS program at a university of your choice. Some organizations, including Infosys, have provisions for employees to take a sabbatical or study leave to pursue higher education. However, this would depend on your employer's policies and your duration of employment with the company. C. Some companies have tie-ups with universities or institutes to provide higher education opportunities for their employees. You can explore such options within Infosys or other companies to advance your academic qualifications. 2. How can I get into Infosys, Gurgaon, after my training in Mysore? After completing your training at Infosys Mysore, you will likely be assigned to one of the company's development centers, based on Infosys' business requirements and needs. To get into the Infosys Gurgaon center, you have a few options: A. While undergoing the training at Mysore, you can express your preference for the Gurgaon location during the location allocation process. Although there is no guarantee that you will be placed in Gurgaon, expressing your preference will increase the likelihood of being allocated to that location. B. Once posted to a particular location, you should focus on performing well in your job and establishing yourself as a valuable employee. After a certain period, you can request a transfer to the Gurgaon location, citing personal or professional reasons such as family ties or better career opportunities. C. Alternatively, you can network with employees or managers in the Gurgaon location and discuss potential opportunities or openings.

Possible answers: be happy, talk more of Kendall's feelings, be angry at Riley Answer:","completion":"It's likely that Kendall's reaction and subsequent actions will depend on several factors including the nature of the feelings that were expressed, the way in which they were expressed, and Kendall's own personality and relationship with Riley. Assuming that Riley has relayed Kendall's feelings to others without her consent and possibly even misrepresented or distorted them, most likely, Kendall might feel a sense of betrayal or violation of trust. In such case, Kendall may not be happy about the situation. In the scenario where Riley has spoken about Kendall's feelings accurately and with good intentions, even if it was done behind her back, Kendall may still feel uncomfortable or violated, because her personal feelings were shared without her permission. Depending on the nature of the feelings discussed and her personality, Kendall might feel exposed or vulnerable. Therefore, Kendall might still not be happy about this scenario. In any case, it's unlikely that Kendall will want to talk more about her feelings after Riley has already shared them without her consent, especially if this conversation is with the very people that Riley has been talking to. Sharing feelings is a deeply personal thing, and it would be natural for Kendall to feel apprehensive or uncomfortable about further sharing after feeling betrayed. Perhaps the most likely scenario is that Kendall might be angry at Riley. Regardless of Riley's intentions, sharing someone's private feelings with others without their knowledge or consent can be considered a betrayal of trust. It can make the person whose feelings were shared feel vulnerable and exposed, and they can naturally react with anger to protect themselves or to express their sense of hurt. Feeling betrayed or violated, Kendall may choose to confront Riley about her actions. This confrontation may help Kendall express her feelings directly and assert her need for privacy and consent, creating a boundary around her personal feelings. Alternatively, Kendall may choose to distance herself from Riley, depending on how deeply she feels betrayed, her capacity to forgive, or her perception of Riley's intention and the potential harm caused. In case Kendall is less confrontational or doesn't want to escalate the situation, she might choose to internalize her anger instead, possibly leading to resentment. This reaction is less healthy because it may not address the issue directly and could lead to further misunderstandings or friction in the future. In conclusion, Kendall's most probable reaction would be to feel anger towards Riley for discussing her feelings behind her back. She would likely want to confront Riley or distance herself from her, depending on Kendall's personality and the nature of their relationship. Kendall is unlikely to feel happy about the situation or want to share more of her feelings. Regardless of her course of action, Kendall has the right to feel respected and have her boundaries acknowledged, and may use this incident as an opportunity to reinforce these in her relationship with Riley."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - A bird hatches from an egg - The bird is nurtured by its parents - And is fed food for growth - The bird grows - Begins to learn how to fly - The bird matures - The bird leaves its nest The answer is:","completion":"The final step of the following process is: The bird becomes independent and self-reliant in its survival and starts its own reproduction cycle to ensure the continuity of its species. After a bird hatches from an egg and is nurtured by its parents, it undergoes several stages of growth and development. As the bird learns to fly and matures, it eventually leaves its nest to embark on the next chapter of its life. This final step marks the moment when the bird stops relying on its parents for food and protection, and steps into its new role as an independent, self-reliant adult. Once the bird becomes independent, its main priorities will typically shift to finding food on its own, establishing its territory, and avoiding predators. As a fully grown and capable adult, the bird will have developed all the necessary skills for navigation, foraging, and defending itself against potential threats. This is essential for the bird's survival, as it allows the individual to adapt to the changing seasons, the availability of food sources, and the ever-present danger of predators. Perhaps the most crucial aspect of the final step in a bird's life cycle is its role in reproduction. By becoming independent and self-reliant, the bird is now able to seek out a mate and breed, thus carrying on its genetic lineage and contributing to the overall survival and success of its species. The process of finding a mate can involve elaborate courtship displays, intricate songs, and fierce territorial competitions, depending on the specific species of bird. Once a mate has been secured, the bird will engage in the process of building a nest, laying eggs, and nurturing the future generation. This involves finding suitable nesting sites, often in locations that offer protection from predators and the elements. The bird will then carefully lay its eggs and incubate them, ensuring the next generation has optimal conditions for development. As the parent bird tends to the egg, it will regulate temperature, humidity, and other factors to support the growth of the embryo. When the young bird is ready to hatch, it will break out of its shell and enter the world. The parent bird will then have the vital responsibility of feeding and nurturing the newborn, teaching it the necessary skills to thrive in its environment, and ultimately preparing it to leave the nest and repeat the cycle. In conclusion, the final step in a bird's life cycle – becoming independent and self-reliant – is a transformative moment that enables the bird to survive on its own, establish its territory, and procreate, thereby ensuring the continuity of its species. This beautiful cycle of life, growth, and renewal continues with each generation, as birds adapt and evolve to their ever-changing environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Arctic Archipelago, is a group of islands north of the Canadian mainland. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere.

Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape. Q: What is the term for stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape? A: Available options: [i] kinetic energy [ii] mechanical energy [iii] vertical energy [iv] potential energy Answer:","completion":"The term for stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape is referred to as potential energy. This is one of the essential types of energy in physics. Potential energy is an integral form of energy as it has the potential to be converted into various forms of energy, including kinetic energy, when circumstances change, for instance when there is a change in an object's position, shape, or state. This stored energy depends heavily on the object's position and configuration, particularly with respect to the forces acting upon it, which might be gravitational, electromagnetic, or nuclear forces. In the realm of electricity, as mentioned in the initial paragraph, electric charges possess potential energy and this energy provokes the flow or movement of these charges when allowed to do so. This electrical potential energy, a category of potential energy, can be converted into different forms of energy, such as light, heat, sound, or kinetic energy, whenever electric charges move through an electrical component like a light bulb or a speaker. In this context, we are excluding other options because they do not specifically address the term of stored energy due to an object's position or shape. Kinetic energy pertains to the energy of an object due to its motion, rather than its position or shape. Mechanical energy also considers the energy of motion (kinetic energy) and energy of position or shape (potential energy), but it's a broader term that includes both kinetic and potential energy working jointly within a system. Lastly, the term 'vertical energy' doesn't apply directly or indirectly in this context, as it's not a recognized form of energy in physics. So, as per the question, the term for stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape, based on the provided options, would be potential energy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. This film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2/3 of the journey. Sadly, the film ends up being too 'confused.' While I know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films I got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and I lost interest. The filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on. We formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering. In the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of escapism. Here's what's concerning Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film: 1. His real estate deals 2. His affair with a radio psychic 3. He's being investigated by internal affairs 4. The homicide investigation If you add in Casey's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death. Now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen. The impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking. As if a ridiculous chase sequence wasn't bad enough, one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour, wasn't bad enough, Joe Gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun. All these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught. We already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot-lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension. While I could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story, I won't. This could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by Gladys Knight is worth noting. Sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable. While this will probably be better than the likes of \\"The Hulk\\" and \\"Lara Croft II\\" that still doesn't make this film good. I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money, I'm not sure if that's true or not. What is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor, this film has neither in its lead roles. My advice to Harrison Ford would be: to stick to Indiana Jones because at least you can still run.

Are these virtual particles? How do we know there is this energy if they didn't exist? Do they really exist? Do virtual particles and energy in vacuum really exist? How do we know if they exist if we can't observe them? Where are they? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To address these questions, I will perform the following steps: 1. Provide a brief explanation of vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles. 2. Discuss whether they exist or are simply theoretical constructs. 3. Explain how we can deduce their existence even if we cannot directly observe them. 4. Address whether these questions are the same. Step 1: Vacuum fluctuations are temporary changes in the energy of a vacuum due to the uncertainty principle, which allows energy to briefly manifest as particle-antiparticle pairs. These particles are known as virtual particles because they cannot be directly observed and exist only for a very short time before annihilating each other. Step 2: Whether virtual particles and vacuum energy really exist is a matter of interpretation in the field of quantum mechanics. Some physicists argue that virtual particles are real, albeit short-lived, while others view them as mathematical tools used to describe quantum fields' behavior. Step 3: Despite not being directly observable, evidence for the existence of vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles comes from several indirect observations. For instance, the Casimir effect demonstrates that two parallel conducting plates can attract each other in a vacuum due to the presence of virtual particles. Another example is the Lamb shift, in which energy level transitions of hydrogen atoms can be explained by the interaction between the atom and vacuum fluctuations. Step 4: Although these questions revolve around the same concept of vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles, they are not all the same. They concern different aspects regarding their existence, the way we deduce their presence, and where they can be found within the scope of quantum mechanics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the first Dutch fort in Asia was built in 1600 (in present-day Indonesia), the first forts and settlements on the Essequibo River in Guyana date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with other European nations. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of the 17th century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of Suriname until it gained independence in 1975, as well as the Netherlands Antilles, of which the islands remain within the Kingdom of the Netherlands today. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The Fon people, also called Fon nu, Agadja or Dahomey, are a major West African ethnic and linguistic group. They are the largest ethnic group in Benin found particularly in its south region; they are also found in southwest Nigeria and Togo. Their total population is estimated to be about 3,500,000 people, and they speak the Fon language, a member of the Niger-Congo language group. - Jacob Elet was a Dutch Chief factor for the Dutch West India Company on the Slave Coast of West Africa during the 18th century who is especially known for having visited in 1733 Agaja , the king of Dahomey , and for having kept a diary chronicling the trip . - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions.

Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". - Pepper Coast was the name given by European traders to a coastal area of western Africa, between Cape Mesurado and Cape Palmas. It encloses the present republic of Liberia. It got its name from the melegueta pepper. The pepper is also known as the \\"grain of paradise\\", which gave rise to an alternative name, the Grain Coast. The importance of the spice is shown by the designation of the area from the Saint John River (at present-day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the \\"Grain Coast\\" in honor of the availability of grains of paradise. In some cases (as shown on the map) this term covers a wider area incorporating Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. - The Oyo Empire was a Yoruba empire of what is today Western and North central Nigeria, and Eastern Benin. Established in the 15th century, the Oyo Empire grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose through the outstanding organizational skills of the Yoruba, wealth gained from trade and its powerful cavalry. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in Yorubaland, but also over nearby African states, notably the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey in the modern Republic of Benin to the west. - The Slave Coast is a historical name formerly used for parts of coastal West Africa along the Bight of Benin. The name is derived from the fact that it was a major source of African slaves during the Atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the 19th century. Other nearby coastal regions historically known by their prime colonial export are the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast, and the Pepper Coast (or Grain Coast). - Dutch West India Company (or ) was a chartered company (known as the \\"WIC\\") of Dutch merchants. Among its founding fathers was Willem Usselincx (15671647). On June 3, 1621, it was granted a for a trade monopoly in the West Indies (meaning the Caribbean) by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the Dutch colonization of the Americas. - Dahomey was an African kingdom (located in the area of the present-day country of Benin) that existed from about 1600 until 1894, when the last king, Behanzin, was defeated by the French, and the country was annexed into the French colonial empire. Dahomey developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the Fon people in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by conquering key cities on the Atlantic coast. - The Tropic of Cancer, also referred to as the Northern Tropic is north of the Equator. It is the most northerly circle of latitude on the Earth at which the Sun can be directly overhead. This occurs on the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent. - Willem Usselincx (15671647) was a Flemish slave owner, slave trader, merchant, investor and diplomat who was instrumental in drawing both Dutch and Swedish attention to the importance of the New World. Usselincx was one of the founding fathers of the Dutch West India Company (Dutch: \\"Geoctroyeerde Westindische Compagnie\\"). - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \\"first colonial empire\\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \\"second colonial empire\\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960. - Agaja (also spelled Agadja and also known as Trudo Agaja or Trudo Audati) was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, who ruled from 1718 until 1740. He came to the throne after his brother King Akaba. During his reign, Dahomey expanded significantly and took control of key trade routes for the Atlantic slave trade by conquering Allada (1724) and Whydah (1727). Wars with the powerful Oyo Empire to the east of Dahomey resulted in Agaja accepting tributary status to that empire and providing yearly gifts. After this, Agaja attempted to control the new territory of the kingdom of Dahomey through militarily suppressing revolts and creating administrative and ceremonial systems. Agaja died in 1740 after another war with the Oyo Empire and his son Tegbessou became the new king. Agaja is credited with creating many of the key government structures of Dahomey, including the \\"Yovogan\\" and the \\"Mehu\\". - Allada is a town, arrondissement, and commune, located in the Atlantique Department of Benin.

He tries his best to maintain a low profile, working at a local grocery store while attending therapy sessions. Yeter is a mysterious woman harboring her own secrets and somehow connected to Ali's past indirectly. They both meet regularly at a local support group for individuals dealing with grief and loss. Step 2: Inciting incident Ali stumbles upon a secret after overhearing a heated conversation between Yeter and the town's sheriff. He learns that Yeter has been involved in a criminal organization responsible for the death of Ali's family, who were innocent victims caught in the crossfire of a turf war. Ali is overtaken by a desperate need for revenge. Step 3: Rising action As Ali gradually pieces together Yeter's involvement and contributions to the organization, he befriends Yeter, pretending he doesn't know about her secret life. He learns about her justifications and motives, discovering that she initially joined the organization willingly but is now desperately trying to escape their clutches and turn her life around. Step 4: The climax A high-stakes situation arises when the criminal organization begins to target Yeter for trying to break free. Desperate to protect herself, Yeter confides in Ali about her predicament, begging him to help her escape. Torn between his thirst for vengeance and his sense of humanity, Ali ultimately decides to help Yeter, hoping she can testify against the organization and bring them down. Step 5: The turning point Just as Ali and Yeter are about to hand over crucial evidence to the authorities, members of the criminal organization track them down, cornering them in an abandoned warehouse. A fierce confrontation ensues, turning into a violent battle for survival. Step 6: The resolution In the heat of the battle, Ali decides to kill Yeter, striking her in an act of personal redemption and preventing her from betraying the organization. Her death, however, leads to a chain reaction that eventually dismantles the organization, which becomes Ali's ultimate goal. Step 7: The ending The movie ends with Ali dealing with the emotional consequences of taking Yeter's life. He eventually chooses to forge ahead, seeking forgiveness, and dedicating his life to advocate for individuals who find themselves entangled in criminal activities without willingly choosing that path.

Premise: The lapse of time, and her absence, will defeat all suspicion. Hypothesis: There will be suspicion with a lapse of time. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"In the given premise and hypothesis, we are examining the relationship between the two statements to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. To decipher this relationship, we must first unpack the meanings of both statements and their contextual relationship. Premise: The lapse of time, and her absence, will defeat all suspicion. In this statement, the premise posits that as time progresses and the individual (presumably a female, given the reference to \\"her\\") remains absent, any suspicion surrounding the person or a particular event will subside. This suggests that no ongoing doubts or uncertainties will plague the minds of the involved parties as time goes by and the person continues to be absent. Hypothesis: There will be suspicion with a lapse of time. Contrary to the premise, the hypothesis proposes that as time passes, suspicion will arise or persist. This statement implies that the passage of time contributes to the growth or maintenance of suspicion, rather than dispelling it. Now that we have a solid understanding of both the premise and the hypothesis, we must evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment refers to a relationship between two statements where the truth of one statement (the premise) guarantees or necessitates the truth of the other statement (the hypothesis). In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, the premise and the hypothesis present opposing outcomes concerning the role of time and absence in fostering or eliminating suspicion. The premise claims that the passage of time and the individual's absence will alleviate suspicion, while the hypothesis asserts that the lapse of time will introduce or perpetuate suspicion. There is a clear contradiction between the two statements, making it impossible for the premise to guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Thus, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The passage of time and her absence, according to the premise, will reduce suspicion, while the hypothesis suggests that the lapse of time will create suspicion. These conflicting outcomes indicate that the premise's truth does not necessitate the hypothesis's truth, and in fact, they negate each other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"if heat is conducted to an object then that object will what?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"if heat is conducted to an object then that object will become hot\\" and \\"hot apparatus causes burns\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"if heat is conducted to an object then that object will what?\\" can be determined through analyzing the provided information and connecting the dots. Hint 1: \\"If heat is conducted to an object, then that object will become hot.\\" This statement tells us that when an object receives or absorbs heat, it will increase in temperature and become hot. Since heat is being conducted to the object, heat transfer is taking place due to the temperature difference between the two bodies in contact. As a result, the energy in the form of heat will move from the hotter body to the cooler one, causing both bodies to experience temperature changes. In this context, the object receiving the heat will experience an increase in temperature. Hint 2: \\"Hot apparatus causes burns.\\" This statement indicates that when an object or apparatus becomes hot, it can cause harm or injury in the form of burns. This is particularly true when humans come into contact with objects at a considerably elevated temperature. Burns occur because hot objects can transfer their thermal energy to our skin or tissues, causing tissue damage and pain. It is a warning to be careful when handling heated objects to prevent potential injury. Now, synthesizing the information from these hints, we can arrive at the best answer: If heat is conducted to an object, then that object will become hotter and potentially cause burns if improperly handled.

A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble and matron Mrs. Corney. At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry, from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London.

World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, the Great War, or the War to End All Wars, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. Unresolved rivalries still extant at the end of the conflict contributed to the start of the Second World War only twenty-one years later. The war drew in all the world's economic great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Allies (based on the Triple Entente of the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary, it did not join the Central Powers, as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive against the terms of the alliance.

He was in charge while parents were out shopping just six miles away. The twins' bodies 'were found by younger siblings' at the home.","completion":"Title: A Horrifying Tragedy: The O'Driscoll Brothers Case Introduction In a shocking incident that left the small community devastated and searching for answers, the O'Driscoll family of Ireland faced an unimaginable tragedy when two of the brothers, Tommy and Patrick, were brutally murdered by their older sibling, Jonathan. This terrible crime took place while their parents were just six miles away, shopping for necessities, adding to the heartbreak and shock felt by the family and the entire community. Background: The O'Driscoll Brothers and Their Family The O'Driscoll family was a typical, humble family living in a small Irish community. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. O'Driscoll, were devoted to their children and worked hard to provide a safe and loving home for them. Their three sons, Jonathan, Tommy, and Patrick, grew up together in this close-knit environment, which made the heinous act committed by one of them all the more staggering. Tragedy Strikes: The Fatal Day On the fateful day, Mr. and Mrs. O'Driscoll left their sons at home, trusting the eldest sibling, Jonathan, to be in charge of the household while they were out shopping just six miles away. It was a routine activity that they had frequently performed, and there was no indication that this day would be any different. However, while the parents were away, unspeakable horror descended on their home. In a fit of uncontrollable rage, Jonathan stabbed his younger twin brothers, Tommy and Patrick, to death. The chilling act left the family and the community asking what could have possibly led to such a gruesome crime. The Horrifying Discovery The lifeless bodies of Tommy and Patrick were discovered by their younger siblings, who had no idea that they would be faced with such a grim sight upon entering the house. The unimaginable horror that these young children had to experience is beyond comprehension, and their lives have undoubtedly been changed forever by this traumatic event. Searching for Answers: Understanding What Led to the Tragedy In the aftermath of the horrifying incident, many unanswered questions remained. What could have driven Jonathan to commit such a heinous act against his own brothers? Was it a result of sibling rivalry that escalated beyond control, or was there an underlying mental health issue that went unnoticed? As police conducted their investigation, the close-knit community of friends and neighbors struggled to come to terms with the tragedy, searching for anything that could provide an explanation for why such a horrific crime had occurred. Ultimately, however, no explanation could ever justify the brutal murders of Tommy and Patrick. Their young lives were taken far too soon, and their family was left to grapple with the unimaginable grief and devastation that this tragic event brought to them. Conclusion: A Community's Grief and a Family's Struggle As the story of the O'Driscoll brothers unfolded, the small community was left reeling from the traumatic event that had tragically struck one of their own families. While no answers could truly console the heartbreak experienced by the O'Driscoll family, the community rallied together to provide support and love in the face of this unfathomable loss. As the O'Driscoll family continued to grieve, the community remained committed to standing alongside them in their time of need. The tragic story of Tommy, Patrick, and Jonathan O'Driscoll served as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing our loved ones while they are still with us. Ultimately, the tale of the O'Driscoll brothers is a poignant example of how tragedy can strike anywhere and affect any family — even one as seemingly loving and close-knit as this small Irish clan. This harrowing account will undoubtedly linger in the hearts of those who knew the O'Driscoll brothers and leave an indelible mark on the community forever."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the other hand, countries that focus on preventing disease and feeding an increasing population are usually those with more immediate concerns and limited resources. They prioritize technologies that can address their challenges more effectively. They concentrate on ensuring food security, containing epidemics, and improving overall public health for their growing populations. Moreover, the attitudes towards investment in technology and innovation are influenced by a nation's culture, history, and leadership. Some countries have an ingrained culture of innovation and embrace cutting-edge technologies, even if it might lead to unpredictable outcomes. Others may be more conservative with adopting new technology, being mindful of consequences and preferring to wait until the technology has been proven in other countries. Also, international partnerships and collaborations on technological advancements can impact the focus of a country's technological developments. Countries with strong ties in the scientific and technological sectors often collaborate on projects, sharing resources, expertise, and goals, thus leading to a convergence of priorities. In conclusion, countries focus on different types of new technology mainly due to their needs and attitudes, which, in turn, influence their technological development. The priorities, resources, and cultural values of each country play a vital role in shaping these decisions and defining the direction of their technological progress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use non-stick pan: A non-stick pan has a special surface that helps to prevent food from sticking. Make sure to heat the pan properly before placing the fish on it. This way, the fish will cook nicely and won't stick to the pan. 2. Use oil or butter: Before you put the fish in the pan, add some oil or butter and let it heat up a little. This will create a layer between the fish and the pan, and the fish will not stick. Make sure to coat the whole area where the fish will be placed.

Kwon Bo-ah (Korean: gweonboa, born November 5, 1986), known professionally as BoA, is a South Korean singer, dancer, composer and actress active in South Korea and Japan. She is referred to as the Queen of Korean Pop. Born and raised in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, she was discovered by SM Entertainment talent agents when she accompanied her older brother to a talent search. BoA's second Japanese studio album, Valenti (2003), became her best-selling album, with over 1,249,000 copies sold. In support of the album, BoA launched BoA 1st Live Tour Valenti, her first Japanese concert tour. Later that year, she released two Korean albums, Atlantis Princess and the mini-album Shine We Are!. The former was the fifth-best-selling South Korean record of the year with around 345,000 units sold; the latter sold around 58,000 units. Her third Japanese studio album, Love & Honesty (2004) was a musical \\"change in direction\\": it contained a rock-dance song (\\"Rock with You\\") and \\"harder\\" R&B. Though the album failed to match Valenti in sales, it topped the Oricon chart for two weeks and became RIAJ-certified triple-platinum. In support of the album, BoA held a tour, Live Concert Tour 2004: Love & Honesty. In contrast with 1st Live Tour, which \\"emphasized exotic Asian design\\", the Love & Honesty tour had an \\"outer-space, sci-fi\\" theme; among the props were a three-story-high space ship and the robot Asimo. The tour, which started in Saitama and ended in Yokohama, spanned nine performances and attracted approximately 105,000 attendants. Her first compilation album, Best of Soul (2005), however, sold over a million copies, making BoA the first non-Japanese Asian singer to have two million-selling albums in Japan. BoA reinvented her image on her fourth Korean album, My Name (2004); she left the \\"cute\\" and \\"youthful\\" style that had characterized previous years and presented herself as \\"sexy\\" and \\"sultry\\". The album was the beginning of a foray into the Chinese market and contained two songs sung in Mandarin Chinese. The sales of BoA's Korean albums began to decline: the album sold 191,000 units and became the eleventh-best-selling South Korean album of the year. In September 2004, BoA instigated controversy in Japan when she donated W50 million to a memorial project for Korean independence activist and nationalist An Jung-geun. Her fifth Korean album, Girls on Top (2005), continued her image change. The album portrayed the singer as more \\"mature and self-confident\\" and was a \\"declaration of war on male chauvinism\\"; the \\"bohemian\\" look of the cover photograph represented \\"freedom and depth\\", while music videos and album photographs that portrayed BoA in traditional Korean dress brought the \\"idea of Korean womanhood\\" into her music. The album also continued BoA's foray into the Chinese market and, like the previous album, contained Mandarin Chinese songs. The album sold less than the previous album; it was the fourteenth-best-selling record of the year in South Korea with 113,000 units sold.

Psychiatrists say 'play with them' Winda Benedetti , NBC News If you are the parent of a child or young adult who loves to play video games, then these are the moments when many frightening questions may be bouncing around inside your head. Could playing video games make my child more aggressive? Do they make young adults antisocial? Most importantly: Can video games inspire a young person to walk into a school and open fire? In the wake of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School many politicians and pundits are holding up video games as possible culprit. As a gamer, I question those who are quick to point the finger of blame at a pastime they don't necessarily understand. But as the mother of a kindergartner who loves to play video games, I share the same concerns for his mental health and well-being that any parent does. Armed with questions, I interviewed two psychiatrists who know much about both kids' mental health ... and video games. Dr. Tyler Black is Clinical Director of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Emergency Unit at BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Dr. Matthew Chow is the Clinical Director of Telepsychiatry at BC Children’s Hospital. Both men have worked extensively with children and young adults dealing with a range of issues including addiction, violence and psychiatric disorders. And both are gamers. As many parents are searching for answers in the wake of the recent tragedy, they offered some helpful insights into the affects video games may have on children and offer some suggestions for parents concerned about their child's love of gaming. Read on. Question: In times like these, many parents worry that playing games could be harmful to their children. What advice would you offer to parents with these concerns? Chow: Talk to your children about video games. Ask them what they are playing. Ask them why they play. Join them in play just as you would any other activity. Children need guidance about appropriate values and behavior in games just as much as in the real world. Children need to know the difference between what happens in a game and the real world. Ultimately, I think the best way to find out if video games are harming your children is to ask, “Is this still fun for you?” Children should be playing games because they want to, rather than because they have to. A child who is playing video games because they want to stay home from school, avoid a particular person, or because they cannot sleep, is probably a child that is playing for the wrong reasons. In those situations, parents should look at the reasons for playing, rather than the video games themselves. Black: Know the games. Read up on the ratings systems — they're excellent. A young child should no more play an M-rated video game than he or she should watch an R-rated movie. If you find a game your child enjoys, play it with them. If your child is spending time with online friends, get to know these friends as you would their real life counterparts. Become a trusted person with your child's gaming, not a \\"person to avoid.\\" The best effect of doing this is that you'll discover what Dr. Chow and I know from personal experience — gaming is fun, and children like it because it is fun. Almost every time there has been a mass shooting in recent years, video games have been blamed, at least in part, at some point — sometimes even before we know whether the shooter even played games. Why do you think that is? Black: The simple answer is that violence is complicated, and an easier answer is simpler to digest. It is so much easier to point at a video game and say, \\"That's the problem,\\" than it is to look at our own society, our own laws, our own views on mental health, and our own systems in fostering a healthy society. Video games have achieved the status of \\"moral panic.\\" That is to say, that the narrative that people hold is that \\"video games are not healthy, and are bad for our children.\\" This is very similar to how television used to be viewed, how jazz music was viewed before that, how novels were viewed before that, and how Shakespeare was viewed before even that. There has always been a moral panic that has us \\"worried for the future generation.\\" I think video games are so prevalent, and yet so foreign to parents and the older generations, that it's easy to see them as \\"scary.\\" Video games have progressed from very primitive to very realistic, the M-rated games have become more violent, and the interactions more realistic. So people make this link that \\"increasing violence is due to increasing use of video games.\\" However, the world is not more violent. In fact, violence in youth continues to decrease year-over-year. So the core concern is unfounded, yet the media and public narrative remains. What can you tell me, from your own work in child and adolescent psychiatry, about the link between violent behavior and video games? Is there one? Black: To be blunt, if there is a relationship, it looks like it is very small. Excellent scientific reviews of the literature (C.J. Ferguson has an excellent review here) have already shown that the existing research is tremendously biased, and doesn't actually show a lot of connection. There are many contributions to violence — genetics, environment, social situation, abuse, education, etc., that video games likely rank very low on the list of contributions. Fortunately, the science is changing, and even some of the biggest names in the \\"violence caused by video game\\" camp are being forced to pivot to admit that, despite decades of research, there is very little evidence to suggest that real world violence has any significant relationship to video games. Chow: I have seen violent behavior in people who play video games, and I have also seen violent behavior in people who do not play video games. That being said, it is becoming harder to find people who have never played a video game. Almost everyone has played a game like 'Angry Birds' on their phone. Despite the proliferation of video games, I am not seeing any increase in violent behaviors in children. If someone wants to prove to me that video games cause violence, they need to explain why the incidence of violent crimes is falling in America while more people are playing video games. I am struck by how very many different studies there are regarding how violent video games affect those who play them. Some studies suggest they are quite damaging. Other suggest the opposite. In your experience, what is the “truth”? What can we take away from this cavalcade of studies? Chow: I have attended conventions where tens of thousands of video gamers have converged on a city. The most recent example was the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle (see video below). Something like 75,000 video gamers showed up. If video games, and in particular violent video games, create violent, antisocial people then you should expect that attending PAX would be one of the most frightening experiences in my life. It was quite the opposite. I found people to be very friendly. They waited in long lines without fighting or cheating. They complimented each other on their gaming skills and costumes. They met up with each other for dinner. I felt safer at night because there were so many people walking around the convention venues ... I challenge the researchers who say that video games are harmful to explain that. Black: To follow up on my point about a \\"moral panic,\\" one of the interesting things about the aspects of a moral panic is that only the research that confirms the panic ever sees the light of day. In 2007, a paper published in the Journal of Pediatrics — The Public health risks of media violence: A meta-analytic review — showed that there is tremendous publication bias in the field of violence and video games. Quite simply, research that shows a negative or no relationship between video games and violence doesn't get published, while research that shows a strong connection is published. The most striking example of why this research is biased comes from the populations they use. Many articles are published, using experiments run on college-age kids (students often in psychology courses, no less!), and yet their \\"results\\" are headlined as evidence for a link between children, violence, and video games. Many people worry that video games can be very isolating to those people — especially young people — who play them. Is that the case? Chow: Video games have evolved into a shared experience. No longer are people playing these games alone in their parents’ basement. People expect to be able to play online. People join online communities populated by tens of thousands of individuals around the world. They participate in prosocial behaviors such as cooperative play, trading, negotiating, forming alliances, and creating rules of conduct. You need to be able to get along with a diverse community in order to succeed in online play. Antisocial people are often marginalized and even banned from popular communities. If you told me that a child was participating in an activity where she was cooperating with tens of thousands of people across the globe to accomplish a shared objective, I would probably label that as prosocial. People playing video games are doing this right now. Black: Dr. Chow is completely right here. Games are no longer black-and-white. There are few examples of a simple \\"violent video game.\\" Video games have moral lessons multiplayer objectives, cooperation, competition, and learning. Even some of the much-ballyhooed games have prosocial components. You can help others in shooting games, you can work together against a common enemy (in Call of Duty's case, zombies!), and you can communicate around the globe. There are problems that crop up from this, and there are real concerns, but video games are complicated now, and they would simply not be fun if there wasn't more to them. The implication after these mass shootings is that video gaming is somehow not normal. Chow: Video games are everywhere. People play them on phones, tablets, airplane entertainment systems, as well as the traditional Xbox and PlayStation. Revenues for the video game industry surpassed those of the movie and music industry years ago. Saying that video gaming is not normal would be like saying that going to a movie or listening to music is not normal. Almost everyone has played a video game. You can no longer separate video gamers and non-video gamers. Black: A Pew Internet & Life Survey showed that 99 percent of American teenage boys and 97 percent of American teenage girls play video games. It is undoubtedly even higher now. Video gaming is a normal element of childhood now. Clinically, when I see children in my office, I don't ask \\"do you play video games,\\" I ask, \\"What games do you play?\\" Being knowledgeable about video games and having that connection with children amplifies my ability to relate to the children I see. Interestingly, we actually see that reflected in some of the disorders we see as well. For example, depression may actually be higher in children who play no video games or more than a few hours a day, than in children who play one or two hours a day. That isn't to say that video gaming treats depression — but it's now just a normal indicator of childhood function. You have spoken before about how young people who struggle with things in “the real world” such as rewards, validation, mastery of skills will seek them out in video games. What do video games provide young people struggling to be successful in the real world? And is seeking that out in a game a positive thing? Chow: Video games can provide a safe environment for people with several advantages over the \\"real world.\\" People can pause or stop a game if it becomes too difficult. They can modify the settings. They can try out new approaches to a task without fear of \\"real world\\" or permanent consequences. They can recruit a diverse array of fellow video gamers from around the world to help them with a troublesome area. In many ways, video games are the modern equivalent of a children’s playground. They provide an area where people can play hard and try new things, but there is always a soft surface to land on if you fall. This sense of security allows people with challenges to come out of their shells and thrive. Black: Children who overuse of video games may actually be turning to video games because it gives them something they are lacking. One of the core beliefs we have in child psychiatry is that children, generally, do their best to succeed. If they cannot succeed in \\"real world\\" activities such as socializing, or school, they may find the success they can attain in an online or video game environment to be preferential. The parent who says \\"my child plays too much\\" may be focusing their attention on the wrong thing. A better question might be, \\"what is causing difficulty in their life that makes play so preferential?\\" Enlisting help in getting the answer to that question may be the intervention that creates true health for a child who overuses games, rather than simply removing the game and the one thing they find enjoyable. In the wake of shootings like these, as video games are brought up as a cause, what do you think the biggest misunderstanding about video games is? Chow: People like to label things as good or bad. It makes the world simpler. Unfortunately, most things are not so black and white. For example, we have heard plenty of news about storms and flooding in the past few weeks. You may be tempted to conclude that ‘water’ is a very bad thing. It destroyed people’s homes and business. It even killed some people. Fortunately, we are not hearing calls to ban water because people know that would be ridiculous. Video games are the same. They are neither good nor bad. They can be both. We can choose as a society to encourage the prosocial aspects of video games, or we can make misguided efforts to curtail or ban video games. Black: The biggest misperception these days is that only social isolates play video games, and that these games cause the types of problems that lead to violence. Video gaming is so prevalent that saying someone \\"plays video games\\" is akin to saying they \\"breathe oxygen.\\" Video gaming is normal. I like to think of myself as normal, I hold a number of jobs, I am married, and I regularly play basketball. I also play video games. I'm not an atypical gamer, I'm a gamer. In moments when there is tragedy and we have so much thought and pause for introspection, it's so important to look at variables as \\"contributors,\\" not causes. It helps to prevent leaping to wrong conclusions. Investigations will be done and information will be discovered, but at the end of the day, there are so many complicated reasons that violence happens in the world, that we as a society need to look at all we are doing (laws, education, health, weapons, etc.) to ensure that violent acts are as rare as they can possibly be.

The political pyrotechnics of a face-to-face encounter between U.S. President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin could eclipse a spectacular fireworks show set to illuminate the Normandy coastline to commemorate the D-Day anniversary. French President Francois Hollande has gone to great lengths to prevent such an uncomfortable meeting. On Thursday evening, Hollande dined with Obama before hosting a separate dinner with Putin. Talk about awkward dinner parties. Obama and Putin are among the leaders invited to take part in French ceremonies Friday marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, which helped change the course of World War II. The two are likely to cross paths in France, Obama said, but no formal talks have been announced. If they should speak, Obama has said, he will give Putin the same message on Ukraine that he has given him in phone calls over past weeks and in his public statements. On Thursday, after a meeting of G7 leaders in Brussels, Belgium, from which Russia was excluded, Obama offered stern words about Russia's actions in Ukraine. Putin \\"has a chance to get back into a lane of international law,\\" Obama said. Obama said Putin could start by recognizing Ukraine's new President-elect Petro Poroshenko, stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. Putin, in an interview with French television station TF1, did not discount the possibility of meeting with Obama. \\"As for my relations with Barack Obama, I have no reason whatsoever to believe he is not willing to talk to the President of Russia,\\" he said. \\"But ultimately, it is his choice. I am always ready for dialogue, and I think that dialogue is the best way to bridge any gaps.\\" The D-Day events also could bring Putin and Ukraine's Poroshenko face to face. Asked if he would speak with Ukraine's new leader, Putin said he will not \\"evade\\" Poroshenko or anyone else. \\"There will be other guests, and I'm not going to avoid any of them.

I'm afraid this one is pretty dreadful, despite several good performances and generally competent acting-for-the-camera direction. It's a first and last attempt by writer-director Soo Lyu. \\"Rub and Tug\\" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of Canada's program to promote home-grown film-making. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts like \\"New Waterford Girl\\" it opens the door for untalented novices like Lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green-lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. You don't mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docu-style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. When your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing happens, the movie is hard to follow and point-of-view impossible to pin down. Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in \\"Exotica\\". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is likable but here she is little else. Kira Clavell's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn's street-wise Betty, more than cancels out her excellent performance in \\"New Waterford Girl\\". Her shallow performance in \\"Rub and Tug\\" should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared; unless you need further confirmation of \\"Waterford\\" director Alan Moyle's skill in working with young actors. You quickly conclude that Lyu's reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and lame \\"deus ex machina\\" device toward the end is hardly a surprise.

It is easier to climb than both Hiunchuli and Singu Chuli which also are trekking peaks of the Annapurna . The ascent requires ice climbing equipment . A climbing permit from the NMA costs 350 USD for a team of up to four members . - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Hiunchuli () is a peak in the Himalayas of central Nepal. The mountain is an extension of Annapurna South. Between this peak and Machapuchare is a narrow section of the Modi Khola valley that provides the only access to the Annapurna Sanctuary. - A waterfall is a place where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of drops in the course of a stream or river. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf. - Ice climbing is the activity of ascending inclined ice formations. Usually, ice climbing refers to roped and protected climbing of features such as icefalls, frozen waterfalls, and cliffs and rock slabs covered with ice refrozen from flows of water. For the purposes of climbing, ice can be broadly divided into two spheres, alpine ice and water ice. Alpine ice is found in a mountain environment, usually requires an approach to reach, and is often climbed in an attempt to summit a mountain. Water ice is usually found on a cliff or other outcropping beneath water flows. Alpine ice is frozen precipitation whereas water ice is a frozen liquid flow of water. Most alpine ice is generally one component of a longer route and often less technical, having more in common with standard glacier travel, while water ice is selected largely for its technical challenge. Technical grade is, however, independent of ice type and both types of ice vary greatly in consistency according to weather conditions. Ice can be soft, hard, brittle or tough. Mixed climbing is ascent involving both ice climbing and rock climbing. - Ice flow. Perhaps the most conspicuous consequence of glacier flow, icefalls occur where the glacier bed steepens and/or narrows. Most glacier ice flows at speeds of a few hundred metres per year or less. However, the flow of ice in an icefall may be measured in kilometres per year. Such rapid flow cannot be accommodated by plastic deformation of the ice. Instead, the ice fractures forming crevasses. Intersecting fractures form ice columns or seracs. These processes are imperceptible for the most part; however, a serac may collapse or topple abruptly and without warning. This behavior often poses the biggest risk to mountaineers climbing in an icefall. - The Annapurna Sanctuary is a high glacial basin lying 40 km directly north of Pokhara. This oval-shaped plateau sits at an altitude of over 4000 metres, and is surrounded by a ring of mountains, the Annapurna range, most of which are over 7000 metres. With the only entrance a narrow pass between the peaks of Hiunchuli and Machapuchare, where run-off from glaciers drain into Modi Khola River, the Sanctuary was not penetrated by outsiders until 1956. Because of high mountains on all sides, the Annapurna Sanctuary receives only 7 hours of sunlight a day at the height of summer. The unique combination of heights and depths on the 5-7 day trek into the Annapurna Sanctuary give rise to an extraordinary variety of ecosystems. The south-facing slopes are covered in dense tropical jungles of rhododendron and bamboo, while the north-facing slopes, in the rain shadow, have a drier colder climate similar to that of the near-by Tibetan Plateau. - The Himalayas, or Himalaya, (or ) are a mountain range in Asia separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. - Annapurna South, also called Annapurna Dakshin or Moditse, is a mountain in the Annapurna Himal range of the Himalayas, and the 101st-highest mountain in the world. It was first ascended in 1964, and is tall. The nearby mountain Hiunchuli is in fact an extension of Annapurna South. - Singu Chuli (also known as Fluted Peak) is one of the trekking peaks in the Nepali Himalaya range. The peak is located just west of Ganggapurna in the Annapurna Himal. A climbing permit from the NMA costs 350 USD for a team of up to four members. The peak requires ice climbing equipment. - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water. - Machapuchare, Machhapuchchhre or Machhapuchhre, is a mountain in the Annapurna Himalayas of north central Nepal. It is revered by the local population as particularly sacred to the god Shiva, and hence is off limits to climbing. - Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Due to the length and extended endurance required and because accidents are more likely to happen on descent than ascent, Rock Climbers do not usually climb back down the route. It is very rare for a climber to downclimb, especially on the larger multiple pitches (class III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Professional Rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock climbing is generally differentiated by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance. - Mixed climbing is a combination of ice climbing and rock climbing generally using ice climbing equipment such as crampons and ice tools. Mixed climbing has inspired its own specialized gear such as boots which are similar to climbing shoes but feature built in crampons. Dry-tooling is mixed climbing's most specialized skill and has since evolved into a \\"sport\\" unto itself. - A trekking peak is a mountain under that is considered climbable by anyone with a moderate amount of mountaineering experience and skills. While some can be climbed without crampons or an ice axe, most require use of this equipment. - Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any other part of the body to ascend a steep object. It is done recreationally, competitively, in trades that rely on it, and in emergency rescue and military operations. It is done indoors and out, on natural and manmade structures.

UPDATED:. 12:38 EST, 26 September 2013. Athletes such as Usain Bolt (pictured) have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness, according to a new study. Scientists have discovered a certain genetic characteristic, or genotype, is more common in power athletes like sprinters than in normal people and even endurance athletes. Usain Bolt and Mo Farah have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness, according to a new study. Polish researchers found the variety of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene is two to three times more common in elite power athletes than nonathletic people. The adjustment to the AGT gene may alter how the renin-angiotensin system performs, changing the way blood pressure, body salt, and fluid balance are regulated in the body. But scientists think the characteristic might give the likes of Bolt a boost by increasing the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, which is crucial for muscle performance. Genetic tests on Polish international elite power and endurance athletes who had competed in World and European Championships, World Cups, or Olympic Games as well as non athletes, were carried out by Dr Ciszczyk of University of Szczecin in Poland. Overall, 100 power-oriented athletes, including sprinters, jumpers and power lifters as well as 123 endurance athletes, such as long-distance runners, swimmers and rowers were tested, while 344 non-athletes were studied for comparison. They found the adjustment to the AGT gene was found in 40 per cent of power athletes, compared 18 per cent of non-athletes, while it was found in just 13 per cent of the endurance athletes. However, results published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research showed there was no real difference between the higher and the lower ranks of elite power athletes who had the gene. 100 power-oriented athletes, including sprinters like Mo Farah (pictured right), plus 123 endurance athletes and 344 non-athletes were studied for comparison. Scientists found the adjustment to the AGT gene was found in 40 per cent of power athletes, compared 18 per cent of non-athletes. The scientists pointed out that while the characteristic was nearly three time more common among the power athletes than endurance athletes, the exact effect the gene had on strength and performance was yet to be determined. Pinpointing the exact genes that make people stronger or faster will have implications for all sports and their elite competitors in the future, according to Dr Ciszczyk. She said: 'Identifying genetic characteristics related to athletic excellence or individual predisposition to types of sports with different demands (power or endurance oriented) or even sport specialty may be decisive in recognizing athletic talent, and probably will allow for greater specificity in steering of sports training programs.'","completion":"A recent study conducted by Polish researchers reveals that elite power athletes like Usain Bolt and Mo Farah possess distinct genetic codes that contribute to their exceptional fitness levels.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: A Modern Musketeer Context: Although the last half of this film was previously considered lost, it has been found and will be available on DVD and TCM in 2008. The film starts with a tongue-in-cheek flashback with Fairbanks as D'Artagnan (with broad winks at the audience), fighting and defeating a tavern-full of swordsmen just to return a mysterious lady's handkerchief. Through a lap-dissolve, d'Artagnan becomes the modern Kansan Ned Thacker, who was born during a tornado and whose mother read him swashbuckling novels while in the womb. After several episodes where Ned gets into trouble trying to defend women (and a cute cameo by Zasu Pitts), we meet Marjorie Daw, whose mother wants her to marry the rich sleazeball Forrest Vandeteer. They run into trouble on a cross-country automobile trip, and are rescued by Fairbanks when he converts his Ford into a railcar to cross a desert washout. At the El Tovar hotel, we meet the villainous Navajo Chin-de-dah, who lives in a secret cliff-house deep in the Grand Canyon, who leads Forrest and Marjorie to his lair with \\"forced marriage\\" on his mind. With the assistance of one of Chin-de-dah's henchmen, Ned Thacker descends the cliffs on a rope and effects a rescue. While the villain is a very unfortunate Indian stereotype, the footage of the Grand Canyon and Canyon de Chelly is spectacular, and taken in the spirit it was intended, this is a fun, somewhat carelessly constructed romp, and a good example of why Douglas Fairbanks was so popular. In the surviving material shown at the Buster Keaton Festival, some confusion is caused when Forrest Vandeteer's name changes to Forrest Barris part way through, probably because of a difference in the source material. Answer:","completion":"Ned Thacker is helped by one of Chin-de-dah's henchmen in the movie \\"A Modern Musketeer.\\" The henchman assists Ned in descending the cliffs on a rope to rescue Marjorie Daw, who was led to Chin-de-dah's secret cliff-house in the Grand Canyon with a forced marriage in mind.

A horse The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Horse Whisperer's Redemption Genre: Mystery/Thriller/Drama Act 1: Setting: The small, picturesque town of Hearthway, known for its love of horses and close-knit community. Introduction: John Shaw, a middle-aged man with a dark past, moves to Hearthway to escape his previous life. He is a talented horse whisperer but keeps his gift a secret. The town's people greet him with warmth and curiosity, but John remains a closed book. He befriends Clare, the owner of a local horse ranch, who sees potential in John's unique talents. Rising Action: When a prized, and seemingly untamable, horse named River has a mysterious accident, leaving it traumatized and unable to ride, Clare convinces John to use his gift as a horse whisperer to heal and rebuild River's trust in people. During the rehabilitation process, John and Clare bond despite John's reclusive behavior. Act 2: Conflict: John gets unwanted attention when a local newspaper reporter, Amelia, starts investigating the newcomer. Digging into his past, Amelia uncovers John's history of violence, specifically his involvement in a gang responsible for horse theft and that he was accused but never convicted of a horse trainer's murder. She publishes her findings in the local newspaper, turning the town's people against John. Realization: Amelia confronts John with the accusations, forcing him to face the truth - that he was indeed wrongly accused of the murder but was too afraid to stand up for himself. He confides in Clare that he was involved in the horse thefts as a way of survival, but never harmed anyone and actually helped the stolen horses find good homes. Realizing the extent of misjudgment, Clare is determined to help clear John's name. Act 3: Discovery: Amelia, working together with Clare, dives deeper into the original murder case to find evidence of John's innocence. The investigation reveals that the actual murderer was a fellow gang member, Kyle, who had framed John. They also discover that Kyle has connections to Hearthway and has been manipulating events in the town for years to exact his revenge on John for leaving the gang. Climax: Kyle, feeling cornered, decides to kidnap the now rehabilitated River as a final act of revenge against John. A thrilling race against time ensues, with the townspeople joining John and Clare to find the prized horse and bring Kyle to justice before it's too late. Resolution: Confronting Kyle at an abandoned farmhouse, John's horse whispering skills play an essential role in calming and rescuing River. With undeniable evidence against him, Kyle is arrested for the long-unsolved murder and his crimes in Hearthway. Act 4: Denouement: The town slowly learns to trust John again, and he continues to help rehabilitate traumatized horses. The connection between John and Clare deepens further, and they decide to become business partners, turning Clare's ranch into a sanctuary for horses. Final Scene: In the end, John and Clare are seen at the ranch, watching as River, now fully recovered and carrying the weight of John's sins, gallops across the fields, with the sun setting in the background. And \\"the body\\", as the embodiment of John's past, finally finds peace as it's metaphorically resting on the back of a horse—signifying the redemption of a haunted man and the town that came together to make it possible. The Horse Whisperer's Redemption becomes not only a tale of mystery and suspense, but also a story of healing, forgiveness, and the power of a close-knit community to overcome the shadows of the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A man who gained nationwide celebrity status on social media as 'Kai the hatchet-weilding hitchiker' today pleaded not guilty to a charge of killing a 73-year-old lawyer in the victim's New Jersey home in May. Caleb McGillivary, 24 - who shot to online infamy in February after a TV interview went viral - stood silent during his arraignment before Superior Court Judge Joseph Donohue. McGillivary's attorney, Union County Public Defender Peter Liguori, filed the not guilty plea to the charge of murder in the beating death of Joseph Galfy, according to Nj.com. Liguori said he could not comment on the case, but acknowledged that McGillivary is feeling better than he did shortly after his arrest. Caleb McGillvary, better known as 'Kai the hatchet-wielding hitchiker' thanks to some internet fame, has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. He is pictured here in a Facebook photo from July, which helped police arrest him thanks to his distinctive facial tattoo. Hospitalized: Caleb McGillvary, known as Kai, is. pictured here following his arrest in May. He was rushed to a hospital in. August with self-inflicted wounds following a suicide attempt. He has pleaded not guilty to murder. A YouTube video in February made Caleb McGillivary an internet star following a hitchiking incident in California. He had been picked up by a man who 'believed he was Jesus' and hit a gas station worker with his car. McGillvary subdued the man with the back of a hatchet. Victim: Lawyer Joseph Galfy Jr, 72, was found beaten to death at his New Jersey home in May. Police allege Caleb McGillvary killed him after a 24 hour rendezvous. 'He's doing better than he was a couple of months ago,' Liguori said. In July, McGillivary was rushed from the Union County jail in Elizabeth to a hospital for treatment of self-inflicted wounds following an apparent suicide attempt. He was later returned to the jail. McGillivary is suspected of beating Galfy, a partner in a Rahway law firm, in Galfy's home on May 12, about 24 hours after the two met in Manhattan's Times Square, authorities have said, following a sexual tryst. In custody: Mugshot of Caleb 'Kai the Hitchhiker' McGillvary, 25, taken after his arrest in Philadelphia. McGillivary is said to have gone to Galfy's home and stayed the night. The next day Galfy, the attorney for the Green Brook land use board, drove McGillvary to the Rahway Train station, from where the younger man left for Asbury Park. McGillvary returned to Rahway later in the day. After exchanging text messages, Galfy picked him up and brought him back to his house. Police allege the killing happened sometime that evening. The next day, Monday May 13, police went to Galfy's home after he did not show up for work or answer his phone. They found Galfy dead in his bed, wearing only underwear and socks. Authorities say McGillivary beat Galfy, then left for Asbury Park and later headed to Philadelphia with a friend. On May 14, McGillivary, who is originally from Canada, wrote a post on his Facebook page intimating he was drugged and sexually assaulted, but did not say where or when. The post read: 'what would you do if you woke up with a groggy head, metallic taste in your mouth, in a strangers house ... and started wretching, realizing that someone had drugged (and) raped ... you? what would you do.' Then-Union County Prosecutor Theodore Romankow has called those comments 'self-serving'. Celebrity: McGillvary (left) became an Internet. sensation in February after giving an interview about his hatchet. heroics, and he was even invited by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel (right) to appear on his show. McGillivary was arrested two days later in Philadelphia after a Starbucks staffer recognized his distinctive facial tattoo and called police. McGillivary became a minor internet celebrity in California last February when hitchhiking. After he was picked up, he used the handle of a hatchet to subdue the driver when that man tried to kill a utility worker with his car, which is how he earned his moniker. McGillivary attracted fans across the country, mostly through Facebook and Twitter, and did a few chat show interviews, including Jimmy Kimmel.

Summarize this article: On Sunday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company managed to meet a self-imposed deadline to produce 5,000 Model 3 cars in a week. The car maker had been under intense pressure to deliver on the sedan, something seen by analysts as integral to Tesla breaking into the mainstream. Tesla has repeatedly missed production targets and failed to reach profitability. Despite those factors, the company pulled out all the stops to produce 7000 cars in total last week. On Sunday, Musk sent an effusively worded communication to all employees, thanking them for their hard work, adding that the company became \\"a real car company\\" in the process. CNBC obtained a copy of the email Musk sent to Tesla staffers, which can be read in full below: From: Elon Musk To: Everybody Subj. 7000 Jul. 1, 12:37 PM We did it!! What an incredible job by an amazing team. Couldn’t be more proud to work with you. It is an honor. The level of dedication and creativity was mind-blowing. We either found a way or, by will and inventiveness, created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible. Intense in tents. Transporting entire production lines across the world in massive cargo planes. Whatever. It worked. Not only did we factory gate over 5000 Model 3’s, but we also achieved the S & X production target for a combined 7000 vehicle week! What’s more, with the widespread productivity gains throughout Tesla and the new production lines spooling up, we are on track to reach 6k/week for Model 3 next month. I think we just became a real car company … Thank you for your hard work and dedication, Elon ||||| Since then, Tesla has raced to iron out kinks in the assembly process, mainly by scrapping some complicated robotic machines that proved ill suited to certain tasks, and hiring hundreds of workers to replace them. On the factory floor, it’s a frantic race to reach Mr. Musk’s goals, one that has taken a toll on some employees. But if the gamble pays off, it will be a big step toward Tesla’s audacious ambitions: not just to be a mass-market automaker, but also to reinvent the way autos are made. “We believe in rapid evolution,” Mr. Musk said in an interview. “It’s like, find a way or make a way. If conventional thinking makes your mission impossible, then unconventional thinking is necessary.” And indeed, Mr. Musk is trying to do things that have never been done. General Motors, Nissan, BMW, Ford and others have produced electric cars, but have been unable to shrink costs enough to make them both affordable and profitable. Mr. Musk, in contrast, has promised investors and customers that Tesla will be able to produce the Model 3 in high volumes, sell versions for as little as 35,000 and ring up hefty profits. Once the Model 3 is rolling, Mr. Musk sees Tesla moving on to produce electric vehicles of all shapes and sizes — pickups, semitrailer trucks, and a fast and roomy car for families called the Model Y. The company’s mission, Mr. Musk has said on numerous occasions, is to lead the transition to emissions-free transportation and to change the world. A recent daylong tour of the Fremont plant revealed how Tesla is trying to break with standard auto-industry practices all along the Model 3 assembly lines. It is searching for ways to shorten the time that robots take to weld parts. It is even making seats, a component most car companies leave to specialized suppliers. And it is doing this while trying to root out bottlenecks and glitches in the manufacturing process. ||||| Tesla finally hit Elon Musk's production goal for the Model 3. The company said in a regulatory filing Monday that it produced 5,031 Model 3s in the last week of the second quarter. Tesla also raised its production target for the Model 3, its most accessibly priced electric car. The company said it expects to make 6,000 per week by late next month. The Model 3 had missed two ambitious production targets, but Musk had promised investors that the company would make 5,000 Model 3s per week by about this time of year. \\"The last 12 months were some of the most difficult in Tesla's history, and we are incredibly proud of the whole Tesla team,\\" the company said in the filing. \\"It was not easy, but it was definitely worth it.\\" Tesla said later in the day that its top engineer, Doug Field, was leaving the company after almost five years. Field took a leave of absence earlier this year. Musk has called him \\"one of the world's most talented engineering execs.\\" A Tesla spokesperson said the company thanked Field \\"for his hard work over the years and for everything he has done for Tesla.\\" The spokesperson did not say why he's leaving. The filing comes after Musk tweeted late Sunday that Tesla's team produced 7,000 cars in seven days. Tesla produced 1,913 Model S and Model X vehicles, it said in the filing. Musk wrote to Tesla staffers that Tesla had achieved its goals. \\"I think we just became a real car company....\\" he reportedly said in the memo. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the memo. 7000 cars, 7 days ♥️ Tesla Team ♥️ — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2018 Musk's promise was a major test for the company, and investors were anxiously watching the production outcome. Tesla stock opened sharply higher, but it drifted lower throughout the day and closed down 2.3%. One analyst, Efraim Levy of CFRA Research, wrote to clients that he does not believe the rate of 5,000 Model 3s per week is \\"operationally or financially sustainable.\\" He said he does expect it to become sustainable over time. Related: Elon Musk vs. the world Tesla confirmed it expects to turn a profit in the third and fourth quarters. It has only reported two profitable quarters in eight years as a public company and is deep in debt. The company is facing questions about its balance sheet, and Musk has lashed out against critics in recent months. Musk continued to insist that he would hit the target of 5,000 Model 3s a week, and that it would give the company enough sales and profit to make it unnecessary to raise more cash. Clarification: This story has been updated to note the Model 3 is Tesla's most accessibly priced car. |||||","completion":"Tesla has achieved its self-imposed target of producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles in a week, as CEO Elon Musk thanked employees in an email obtained by CNBC.

Bernard also works as a low-level assistant at the library, where his father is constantly monitoring and admonishing him. His father decides it's time he grew up and moved out of the family home in Great Neck and into his own Manhattan apartment. His mother is not happy about letting him go, but acquiesces to her husband and arranges for Bernard to live in a rooming house run by nosy, prudish Miss Nora Thing. Miss Thing inherited the building on the condition that her late brother's aggressive pet rooster be allowed to occupy the fifth floor, which Bernard must pass to get to his room. Miss Thing reassures Bernard's mother that the rooster only attacks girls, especially young pretty girls, to which Bernard's mother responds that her son isn't interested in girls yet, but arranges that Miss Thing will spy on Bernard and report any \\"female\\" activity.

It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

Article: When we interviewed what the life was like more than 70 years ago, many old soldiers were full of tears in their eyes. They told us that they never forgot those days when they were in the army, during which they lived hard lives but spared no effort to fight against the enemies. Now in the year 2015 comes the first great parade in the 21stcentury. September 3rdis the 70thanniversary of the victory of the anti-fascist war. This day is considered as an important moment for China, as well as the world. 49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion. In preparation for the parade, the soldiers worked hard every day. In order to walk well in the three hundred meters distance on the Tian'anmen Square, they had to receive extremely strict training. Each day, they got up early in the morning and started the 10 hours' practice. When a reporter arrived, it was raining heavily outside, but none of the soldiers stopped training. Nothing can stop their training, and no one can stop their deep love to their motherland. The reporter asked, \\"The training is so hard but why does nobody give up?\\" \\"It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony. I consider it a great honor. I must try my best.\\" One of the participants answered. In fact, everyone takes pride in taking part in this big parade because they want to show the spirit of Chinese army, the power of Chinese army, as well as the determination of keeping the world in peace. From the soldiers, we learned the power of dreams. If one has a dream, he will get over any difficulties that get in the way to make the dream come true.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss' classic tale, and well... it's not very good. First off, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As characterised by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. There is no method to Carrey's madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean , I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like his countryman Michael Caine), but this one needs to be filed under \\"Films that should never have been made.\\" This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the TV special. This is 2 hours you can never, ever get back.","completion":"Absolutely, dear! The review has a negative sentiment, which means the person didn't like or enjoy the movie very much.

In response, the zoo administration has decided to press charges against the mother for her reckless behavior, endangering not only the life of her child but also posing a serious threat to the animals. The disturbing incident took place on April 11, 2023, when visitors to the Cleveland Zoo noticed a mother holding her son precariously over the railing of the cheetah enclosure. According to eyewitnesses, the woman lost her grip on the child, and he plunged more than 10 feet into the exhibit. Miraculously, the boy suffered only minor injuries and was quickly retrieved by the father, who vaulted into the enclosure to rescue him. Fortunately, the cheetahs did not react aggressively and the family was able to escape without any further harm. Following the incident, the zoo’s administration conducted a thorough investigation into the matter and found that there were no issues with the cheetah exhibit's barriers or security measures. According to a spokesperson for the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, the barriers surrounding the exhibit met the safety standards and specifications required to protect both visitors and animals. Furthermore, the zoo has successfully maintained a clean safety record throughout its history. \\"The safety of our visitors and the welfare of our animals are always our top priority,\\" stated the zoo's spokesperson. \\"The incident that occurred was the direct result of someone disregarding basic safety precautions, endangering not only themselves but others in the vicinity. We will be pursuing all available legal options and pressing charges against the individual responsible for this reckless act.\\" The family involved in the accident has been burdened with an overwhelming amount of public scrutiny and criticism. The mother, whose identity is being withheld to protect her privacy, could potentially face criminal charges for the negligence displayed during the incident. Legal experts have suggested that the mother could be charged with child endangerment, as well as trespassing, due to the father’s unauthorized entrance into the exhibit. Zoos and wildlife parks around the world continually emphasize the importance of adhering to safety guidelines and respecting the boundaries set to protect both visitors and animals. Incidents like this serve as a stark reminder of the potential dangers that can arise when proper precautions are disregarded. The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo’s decision to press charges is grounded in its commitment to visitor safety and serves as a public reminder of the integral role of personal responsibility in ensuring safe and enjoyable zoo experiences. In the aftermath of the incident, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is taking the opportunity to review and reinforce its safety protocols. The zoo administration has issued a public statement reminding visitors to stay behind barriers, keep a close watch on their children, and report any suspicious or inappropriate behavior they witness. \\"We believe that education and awareness are the best tools for promoting safety,\\" said the zoo spokesperson. \\"We encourage all visitors to exercise caution and vigilance when enjoying the exhibits at our zoo to ensure a safe and memorable experience for everyone.\\" As the Cleveland Zoo continues its legal action against the mother responsible for the incident, the story serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of following safety guidelines and respecting the creatures that share our planet. Only through vigilance and awareness can both visitors and animals enjoy the beauty, wonder, and majesty of the world's diverse fauna."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Add spaces: ElectricalapparatusforphysicaldepositionbysputteringonLCDsubstrates","completion":"Electrical apparatus for physical deposition by sputtering on LCD substrates This phrase refers to a specific type of electrical equipment used in the process of creating thin film coatings on various surfaces, such as Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) substrate materials. Below, we will break down the phrase into its components to better understand the process. 1. Electrical apparatus: This refers to the equipment and machinery used to generate, control, or utilize electrical energy during a specific process or operation. 2. Physical deposition: In the context of thin films and coatings, physical deposition is a process in which a material is deposited onto a substrate to create a thin film. This process can involve a range of techniques, such as evaporation, sputtering, or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). 3. Sputtering: Sputtering is a deposition technique in which particles are ejected from a solid target material due to bombardment by energetic particles, typically ions. This ejected material then forms a thin film on the substrate, which can be a surface or the flat base on which an object is placed. This method is widely used to deposit thin layers of metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics onto various substrate materials. 4. LCD substrates: Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) substrates are thin layers of material that provide a solid base for the formation of LCD elements, such as the active-matrix or the color filter layer. The substrate often consists of glass or plastic materials and plays an essential role in the overall functionality, durability, and performance of the final LCD product. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Electrical apparatus for physical deposition by sputtering on LCD substrates\\" refers to a specific type of machinery used in the production of thin film coatings on LCD substrates using sputtering techniques. This process is crucial for creating functional and durable LCD screens and is widely employed in the electronics industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. We have heard how the system has reached various levels of crisis from \\"tipping point\\" and \\"breaking point\\" to \\"on the brink of collapse\\". But is it really that bad? And if so, what can we expect in 2017? Firstly, let's put these predictions in context. Perhaps the most significant warning of recent months came from the Care Quality Commission. In is State of Care report, in October, the regulator said the system was at a \\"tipping point\\". By that, it didn't mean the whole system was about to collapse. The NHS has always found - no matter how acute the pressures - a way of carrying on. It simply prioritises the most in need. So what was the CQC getting at? Put simply, it was saying the health and care system had reached the point where the gradual deterioration in standards had gathered such momentum that another drop and the rate of deterioration would accelerate exponentially. So what could that mean for patients? Longer waiting times for sure. Key targets are already being missed. One in 10 patients in England is currently waiting longer than four hours to be dealt with in A&E. This is the worst performance since the target was introduced in 2004. And in Wales and Northern Ireland, the situation is even worse. But if you want to know how bad it could get, the worst performers give us a clue. In some hospitals, a third of patients have to wait longer than four hours to be seen. The waiting list for non-emergency operations, such as knee and hip replacements, is also getting worse. Soon there will be 4 million people waiting for an op - that is one in 13 people. So far, the NHS has managed to keep the long waiters - those waiting more than six months or even a year - down to a bare minimum. But as the NHS can only see about 300,000 patients a month, it seems pretty clear that is going to change. The frightening thing for ministers - and in particular the Treasury - is just how much cash the NHS is swallowing. Over Â£130bn is spent on the health service across the UK. In England, the budget was increased by 4% in real terms this year. But still it hasn't got enough. Hospitals continue to rack up deficits. And while the NHS will undoubtedly still manage to balance its books by year end in March because of surpluses elsewhere, the prospects for the next financial year are much gloomier. The 2017-18 year will see a much smaller rise in the budget - under 1% once inflation is taken into account. That - to borrow a phrase from former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson - really will be squeaky bum time. Yes you can always argue the Treasury will step in and provide more funds, but no area of government spending has had as generous a settlement as the NHS. Tough questions will be asked and cuts will undoubtedly have to follow. Talking of cuts, isn't there a whole host in the pipeline? Yes. In the coming months expect to hear plenty about the catchily named sustainability and transformation plans. There are 44 of them covering the whole of England and some are pretty radical - involving closures of A&E and maternity units and, in some cases, whole hospitals. Consultations are likely to be getting under way over the next few months and these are bound to provoke local protests. Another hot topic at the moment is social care - and that brings us back nicely to the original warnings of Armageddon. This covers the council-funded services provided to disabled and elderly people, such as care homes and help in the home for daily tasks such as washing and dressing. And it is what is happening in this sector which many believe could be the straw that \\"breaks\\" the camel's back. At a time when the population is ageing you would think more and more people would be getting help. But the opposite is true. The number of over-65s being helped has fallen by over a quarter in the past five years. This is seen as critical, because the cuts have been linked to the rising numbers of older people turning up at A&E. The care system and NHS are - it is argued - two sides of the same coin. The government has already tried to take action. Before Christmas, ministers announced that councils would be able to raise council tax more quickly than had been planned. But the jury is out on whether this will actually lead to that much more money being invested in services. And with four times as many people sitting outside the council care system (once you combine those getting no care, paying for it or relying on family) as are inside, any impact is going to be limited. So where does that leave us? Seasoned observers have started talking about a return to the 1990s when images of overcrowded hospitals and stories of patients waiting years for treatment dogged John Major's Tory government at almost every turn.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who was the Saint Lawrence River Valley controlled by? ? Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

The construction of Fort Ticonderoga, originally known as Fort Carillon, by the French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière during the French and Indian War, demonstrates their control over this key strategic location.

Article: When I was about twelve, I headed to a restaurant for dinner with my family. It was winter, and on that particular night, the wind was really blowing. As my mom and I headed towards the restaurant from our car, a girl about my age and her mother came up to us. They asked if we had any spare change. My mom immediately asked where they kept their things. They pointed to an old car in a parking across the street. The girl said there were six of them living in that car, which was the same size as my own family. My mom said she had something to do after handing the people a few dollars. She sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my three siblings. But she didn't come. Later, I found out she had gone home and practically emptied our cupboards into a few bags. Then, she brought that food over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that part happened, but I can only imagine the joy it brought to their faces. A few days later, when I actually found out about what she had done, I asked her why she helped those people. She told me that they were not lucky. I remember the face of that girl who had asked us for change, she was the same age as me, yet we looked so different. Here I stood, dressed in almost new clothes, headed to dine in a restaurant and then back home to the bedroom I shared with my younger sister.

I still have that aging tape, which I try to watch annually. It was the year my first child was born, and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times -- many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background. I finally broke down this year and ordered a DVD, which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie. Charles Dickens' story is captured in outstanding fashion here. George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as Scrooge. The supporting cast is equally spectacular. This is, to my mind, a flawless production. Little details add much to the enjoyment. The game \\"similes\\" Scrooge's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item.

Honestly, I can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays I enjoy more than indulging in this CBS production, which was originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to watch the old tape with the original IBM commercials ... which show just how much computers have evolved in 21 years. Amazing how things have changed!)

In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Bears QB Rex Grossman completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Desmond Clark for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Giants got on the board as RB Derrick Ward got a 2-yard TD run. Chicago responded with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 35-yard and a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould making a 41-yard field goal for the only score of the period.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: Through his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully. Sentence 2: His eyes were wide open If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true, given that the first sentence is true, let's analyze both sentences and their implications. Sentence 1: Through his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully. In this sentence, the subject, presumably a person, is described as having their eyelids nearly shut, or mostly closed. The word \\"reconnoitred\\" suggests that the person is examining or surveying their surroundings in a cautious or attentive manner. The use of \\"almost-closed lids\\" implies that there is still a small opening in the person's eyelids, allowing them to see, but the implication is that the subject's eyes are not fully open. Sentence 2: His eyes were wide open. This sentence, in contrast to the first one, suggests that the subject's eyes are extensively open, allowing an unrestricted view of their surroundings. The phrase \\"wide open\\" holds opposite meaning to \\"almost-closed lids\\" as it means the subject's eyes are open to the fullest extent. Considering that the first sentence is true, the second sentence cannot be true at the same time, as these two sentences contradict each other. The first sentence states that the person's eyes are nearly closed as they examine their surroundings, while the second sentence indicates that the person's eyes are wide open. These descriptions are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist for the same subject at the same moment. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence must be false, since the two descriptions of the subject's eyes cannot both be accurate at the same time. It is important to understand the context in which these sentences are presented; however, based on the information provided solely within both sentences, we are left to conclude that both sentences cannot be true simultaneously."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One complaint I've heard from people before is that the wait is too long. First of all, remember that the restaurant has 15 tables and its worth waiting for quality, locally grown food. Dependent on what time you come to Greenbush Bar, it can be busy but they do work hard to keep things moving. If you are hoping to get seated quickly, the best time to come is earlier in the dinner service or later in the night. Also, Greenbush gets a good size crowd for Badger games, specifically basketball and football games. They do not take reservations so if you have a bigger table, you may have to wait a little bit.

Please answer the following question: Who does Eddie live with on the barge? Answer the above question based on the context below: In New York City, 1934, jazz singer Dot Clark and her shady gangster boyfriend, Louie The Lug (\\"An Earful of Music\\"), are introduced. After having an affair with the deceased Professor Edward Wilson, Dot is now technically his common-law wife and heiress to 77 million. She has to go to Egypt to claim the money, and sets off with Louie in hopes of getting the cash. Former assistant to Edward Wilson, Gerald Lane, informs the law offices of Benton, Loring, and Slade of Professor Wilson's death and the fact that Edward's son, Eddie Wilson, Jr, is the rightful heir to the money. Mr. Slade, the lawyer, goes to a barge in Brooklyn where Eddie is living with his adopted father, Pops, an old stevedore, and his three sons, Oscar, Adolph, and Herman, who roughhouse Eddie. However, Eddie is managing to live a nice life nonetheless, with his girlfriend, Nora 'Toots', and his care for all the kids on the barge. He dreams of the day when he will have enough money to live his own life outside of the dirty barge (\\"When My Ship Comes In\\").

Write an article that answers the following question: Which player threw the shortest touchdown pass of the game?","completion":"Title: Uncovering the Shortest Touchdown Pass in the Game Introduction In the game of football, a touchdown pass is one of the most exhilarating events. It is when the quarterback throws the ball to a receiver, and it's caught in the opposing team's end zone, resulting in a scoring play. Often, we witness long, impressive passes that stretch across the field. However, today, we're here to uncover which player threw the shortest touchdown pass of the game. Short touchdown passes may not garner as much attention as long ones, but they still exhibit skill and can be crucial in securing a victory. Step 1: Identify the game and its key players To answer the question, we must first specify which game we are analyzing. Football games occur at various levels, from high school to college and the NFL. There could be different players in different matches with varying contributions. We can also focus on a specific time frame, such as a particular season, week, or even a historical era. Step 2: Obtain the statistics and game data After identifying the particular game, we can proceed by gathering the game data and statistics. Many online sources, such as ESPN, NFL.com, or NCAA.com, provide comprehensive information and archive the relevant statistics on touchdown passes. We would need data on the players, teams, the length of their touchdown passes, and the related gameplays. Step 3: Analyze and extract the data Upon obtaining the necessary data, it's time to analyze and search for the shortest touchdown pass. By comparing the length of touchdown passes by individual players, we can determine the pass with the shortest length. It's important to note that our answer might vary depending on the context (e.g., in a specific game, season, or career) Step 4: Present the findings With analysis complete, we can present the answer in a structured manner: - Name of the player - Their team affiliation - The game (inclusive of the date and opponent) - Length of the touchdown pass (usually measured in yards) - A brief description of the gameplay leading to the touchdown Conclusion While the shortest touchdown pass in a game might seem like a trivial statistic compared to broader figures like total passing yards or touchdowns, it can reveal essential elements of how teams strategize and adapt during matches. Success on the field relies on not just astoundingly long passes but also crucial short ones that can lead to scoring plays. Therefore, identifying the player who made the shortest touchdown pass in a game not only adds to the narrative of the match but can also highlight the quarterback's ability to capitalize on opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English English:","completion":"My absolutely negative stance on the use of nuclear power is well known. In detail, my strong disapproval of nuclear power stems from several factors, such as environmental concerns, potential disasters, and long-term waste storage. Allow me to explain further: 1. Environmental concerns: The production of nuclear power involves the mining of uranium, which is a non-renewable resource. Extracting uranium from the ground can result in the release of radioactive particles and chemical waste into the environment. Additionally, large quantities of water are required to cool reactors, which may lead to water shortages and the destruction of aquatic ecosystems. 2. Potential disasters: The history of nuclear power has been marred with accidents and disasters, such as Chernobyl and Fukushima. These incidents have caused significant loss of life, long-term health issues, and irreversible damage to the surrounding environment. In the event of a nuclear disaster, the effects can be felt for generations to come. 3. Long-term waste storage: Nuclear power produces radioactive waste that can remain hazardous for thousands of years. The storage of such waste is a concern, as there has not been an effective solution for its safe disposal. Nuclear repositories and storage sites can leak and contaminate groundwater, putting both wildlife and human populations at risk. Furthermore, there are alternatives to nuclear power that are more sustainable, renewable, and less risky. Solar, wind, and hydro power have made enormous strides in recent years, with advancements in technology making these energy sources more efficient and reliable. If these alternative energy sources continue to be developed and implemented on a large scale, they can reduce our dependency on nuclear power. In conclusion, my absolutely negative stance on the use of nuclear power is based on the significant environmental, safety, and long-term storage risks associated with this energy source. Instead, I strongly advocate for the exploration and increased use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. By investing in clean, sustainable sources of energy, we can protect our environment and work towards a more responsible and secure energy future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Microsoft's blogging platform was called MSN Spaces (later renamed to Windows Live Spaces) and was a part of its MSN family of online services. MSN Spaces allowed users to create and manage their blogs, customize the look and feel, add photos, and interact with their readers through comments and guestbooks. Additional features included integration with other MSN services, such as MSN Messenger and MSN Music, access control features for privacy, and compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices. Microsoft's entry into the blogging world demonstrated the increasing importance of user-generated content and self-expression in the ever-evolving internet landscape of the 2000s. With the rise of social media platforms, blogging served as an essential precursor to the democratization of online content, empowering individuals to share their thoughts, ideas, and lives with the world at large. However, as social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter grew rapidly in popularity, the demand for traditional blogging platforms began to dwindle. Windows Live Spaces was eventually shut down in 2011, and Microsoft partnered with WordPress.com to provide a smooth migration path for Spaces users who wanted to continue blogging. In conclusion, Microsoft's 2004 foray into the blogging world, characterized by the term \\"vox populi,\\" demonstrated an important trend in the history of the internet - the growing importance of user-generated content and the giving of voice to the masses. It allowed individuals from various walks of life to share their thoughts and opinions on numerous subjects, paving the way for the globally connected social media landscape we know today. Although Windows Live Spaces eventually shut down, it served as a crucial landmark in the development of modern online communications and content creation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: when slavery abolished I found the following answer on Google: About 645,000 were brought to what is now the United States. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google, which states \\"About 645,000 were brought to what is now the United States,\\" is not a correct answer to the question of when slavery was abolished. Slavery in the United States was officially abolished with the adoption of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865. The amendment states, \\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\" The process of abolishing slavery had begun earlier with the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, which declared that slaves in the rebellious Confederate states \\"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\\" However, the Emancipation Proclamation did not end slavery in the entire United States, and it took the ratification of the 13th Amendment to fully abolish slavery across the nation. Regarding the number you found, 645,000 refers to an estimated number of enslaved Africans who were brought to what is now the United States during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. This historical event took place from the 16th to the 19th century. It is important to note that the number mentioned is only an estimate, as it is challenging to determine the exact number of enslaved people who were forcibly brought to various territories in the Americas. Furthermore, this number does not address the issue of when slavery was abolished but rather provides information on one aspect of the history of slavery in the United States."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Gordon Reid (tennis)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the man who was arrested after the Yeomanry charged into a crowd, killing a child?, using the article: The Peterloo Massacre took place at St Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16 August 1819, when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000–80,000 who had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehending Hunt. The 15th Hussars were then summoned by the magistrate, Mr Hulton, to disperse the crowd. They charged with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 18 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to crack down on reform, with the passing of what became known as the Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian, but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial.

An Australian tennis player who allegedly threatened to post nude photos of his ex-girlfriend online has been charged in the U.S. with aggravated stalking. Mark Terry Henderson was once part of one of the world's top-60 doubles team and was ranked Australia's top-ranked tennis junior in 1999, before going on to play at two U.S. universities and coach at Northwestern and Western Michigan universities. For about five years, Henderson, 32, had been in an on-and-off again relationship with a 29-year-old Chicago woman when she ended the relationship in February, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. Mark Terry Henderson, pictured, was charged in the U.S. after he stalked and threatened his ex-girlfriend. Despite having returned to Australia to live in Brisbane, for months the former tennis star allegedly harassed his ex-girl friend with emails, texts and phone calls, including threatening her life, prosecutors alleged. Prosecutors said Henderson even sent a collage made up of naked photos of his former partner to her and threatened to post it on the internet if she refused to send him more naked photos. But even after police in Australia and Chicago contacted him about the harassment, Henderson continued his behaviour. Police in Chicago and Australia contacted him, but he allegedly continued the harassment. Henderson was previously ranked Australia's top junior tennis player and went on to enjoy a career coaching at U.S. universities. On May 6, Henderson left Australia bound for Chicago and was found by police the following day sitting outside his ex-girlfriend's parents house, it has been alleged. On a nearby street later that day, the Australian man approached the woman and again threatened her life before she ran to her car and locked her self inside, prosecutors said. Henderson tried opening all of the car's door handles, but the woman successfully escaped and call police, prosecutors said. Following the incident, Henderson fled to Tennessee, was arrested and extradited back to Chicago on Thursday. A judge granted him US500,000 (A540,980) bail if he surrendered his passport, stopped using social media and required to be GPS monitored. Henderson told the judge on Saturday that he wanted the Australian consulate notified of his arrest. He returns to court on Tuesday, reported the Chicago Tribune.

Woody Harrelson says he got into a clash with a photographer because he mistook him for a zombie. The TMZ photographer filed a complaint with police claiming the actor damaged his camera and pushed him in the face at La Guardia Airport, according to an airport spokesman. \\"We're looking into this allegation and if it's warranted, we'll turn it over to the proper authorities,\\" said Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Ron Marsico.

Harrelson, who is being sued by another TMZ photographer for an alleged assault in 2006, did not deny his involvement. \\"I wrapped a movie called 'Zombieland,' in which I was constantly under assault by zombies, then flew to New York, still very much in character,\\" Harrelson said in a statement issued Friday by his publicist. \\"With my daughter at the airport I was startled by a paparazzo, who I quite understandably mistook for a zombie,\\" he said.

He did mention in May that the Essential Phone would run stock Android but I wasn't expecting him to have such an extremely light touch and to barely alter anything about the OS. Rubin created Android so he 's no stranger to developing mobile phone software. And given how much attention Essential paid to every little detail of the phone's hardware it's a good bet that Rubin didn't just go with the plain version of Android out of sheer laziness.

Stock Android means none of the duplicate apps from the smartphone maker and carrier cluttering things up. Android looks and works exactly the way Google intended it to. To be clear those companies make great phones as their popularity shows. Yet I've always believed that nothing beats stock Android. So thanks Andy Rubin for backing me up.

Article: Like distance runners on a measured course,all of us will move through time in a roughly predictable pattern. In the first stage of our lives,we develop and grow, reaching toward the top of physical vitality . After we grow up,however, the body begins a process of gradually wearing out. A new awareness of physical fitness may help lengthen our years of health and vitality,yet nothing we do will work to stop the unavoidable force of aging. Most of the changes of aging take place deep inside the body.The lungs become less able to take in oxygen.Powerful muscles gradually lose their strength.The heart loses power and pumps less blood.Bones grow easier to break. Finally, we meet a stress,a stress that is greater than our physical resistance.Often,it is only a minor accident or chance infection(a disease caused by virus),but this time, _ brings life to an end. In 1932,a classic experiment nearly doubled the lifetime of rats,simply by cutting back the calories in their diet The reason for the effect was then unknown. Today, at the University of California at Berkley, Dr.Paul Seagle has also greatly lengthened the normal lifetime of rats.The result was achieved through a special protein limited diet,which had a great effect on the chemistry of the brain.Seagle showed that within the brain,specific chemicals control many of the signals that influence aging.By changing that chemical balance,the clock of aging can be reset. For the first time, the mystery of why we age is being seriously challenged.Scientists in many fields are now making striking and far-reaching discoveries. An average lifetime lasts 75 years,yet in each of us lies a potential for a longer life.If we could keep the vitality and resistance to disease that we have at age twenty, we would live for 800 years.

That said,","completion":"it's no surprise that the Vulcan nomination is gaining traction and support from Star Trek enthusiasts worldwide, including the franchise's stars themselves. William Shatner, who portrayed the legendary Capt. James T. Kirk, took to Twitter to rally his millions of followers, urging them to vote for Vulcan as the new name for one of Pluto's moons. Leonard Nimoy, the actor responsible for bringing Mr. Spock to life on screen, also expressed his approval, stating that \\"Vulcan is the logical choice.\\" The idea of naming a celestial body after a beloved fictional planet not only speaks to the power of pop culture but also to the deep connection that people have with the stories and characters of Star Trek. The show, which first debuted in 1966, has inspired generations of fans, known as Trekkies, and has left an indelible mark on science fiction as well as on the broader cultural landscape. The SETI Institute, known for its work in the search for extraterrestrial life, sees the opportunity to engage the public in their research and the wonder of space exploration through the process of naming these moons. The institute narrowed down the list of potential names to 21 choices, which includes other options also inspired by mythology and celestial bodies such as Persephone, Orpheus, and Elysium. Each of these options holds significance, with Persephone representing the queen of the underworld, Orpheus the famed musician and poet from Greek mythology, and Elysium symbolizing the idyllic afterlife in classical mythology. Although the International Astronomical Union, responsible for the designation of celestial bodies, traditionally selects names based on mythological figures and historical events, they recognize the value of engaging the public in this process. The online voting system allows people from all walks of life to participate in an activity that was once reserved for a select few scientists and experts. Social media platforms have been abuzz with users discussing their picks for the new names for Pluto's two unnamed moons, which are currently known by their scientific designations P4 and P5. With the popularity of the Star Trek franchise, it's no wonder that Vulcan has emerged as the frontrunner, garnering enthusiasm from fans and non-fans alike. Regardless of which name ultimately wins the public vote, the effort to involve people in the naming process is a testament to the profound impact science fiction has on our collective imagination and our innate curiosity about the cosmos. As the vote comes to a close this Monday, one can't help but marvel at the passion and energy generated by this unique opportunity to leave a lasting mark on our understanding of the universe. In the end, the International Astronomical Union will have the final say on the names of Pluto's moons. However, the process of public participation and the overwhelmingly positive response to the Star Trek-inspired nomination for Vulcan highlight the deep-rooted connections people have with the vastness of space and the stories we create to populate it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His second stop came on lap 32 of 67, but he pitted for a third time just seven laps later after Adrian Sutil spun his Sauber and was left stranded in the middle of the track. Race stewards decided not to put the safety car out out for the second time and at this point Hamilton's engineers pulled him in for a third stop. He still looked set to overtake Massa's teammate Valtteri Bottas for second, but the Finn drove superbly to hold him off in the closing stages.

After losing Megan's important flash drive, Sarah tried to apologize but","completion":"Megan was inconsolable. The flash drive contained crucial information for an upcoming presentation, along with years' worth of research. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Sarah decided that she must do everything in her power to recover the lost flash drive. Step 1: Retrace her steps As a first step, Sarah retraced her steps from the moment she borrowed the flash drive until she realized it was lost. She tried to recall every location she visited, every table she sat at, and the people she spoke with. By listing out these locations, she hoped to narrow down her search and identify potential spots where she might have misplaced the flash drive. Step 2: Enlist help and inform relevant parties Next, Sarah enlisted the help of her friends and colleagues to search for the flash drive at the possible locations she identified. She also informed her supervisor and requested an extension for the presentation, explaining the mishap and assuring that they were doing everything possible to recover the crucial data. Step 3: Search and explore Together with her friends, Sarah visited each of the locations they identified and meticulously searched for the flash drive. They spoke with the staff at cafes and the library, and even placed notices describing the lost flash drive and Sarah's contact details in case someone found it. Step 4: Utilize technology Sarah remembered that some flash drives have built-in tracking capabilities to help locate lost devices. She searched online for any tracking software associated with the flash drive's brand and contacted the manufacturer's support team to inquire about possible tracking solutions. Step 5: Exhaust all alternatives If they still hadn't found the flash drive, Sarah considered replicating the work that was stored on it. She reached out to Megan and other researchers involved in the same project, asking them for any records, notes, or duplicates they might possess. Although this wouldn't fully replace the lost work, it would at least provide a starting point for rebuilding the presentation and research. Step 6: Acknowledge responsibility and learn from the experience Despite her best efforts, if Sarah still couldn't locate the flash drive, she would have to face the harsh reality and own up to her mistake. She would offer to work overtime and put in extra effort to somehow compensate for the lost information. Additionally, she would learn from this experience and become more cautious when handling sensitive data. In the end, whether they found the flash drive or not, Sarah knew she had to make amends both with Megan and the project. She resolved to handle such responsibilities with care in the future and to support Megan in salvaging the lost work, as this experience had taught her a valuable lesson in accountability and trust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Greater evidence of such a people is found on Mallorca and Menorca than on Ibiza, but one of the Balearics' most important sites is actually on the island of Formentera, where the megalithic monument/tomb of Ca Na Costa has been dated to 2000 b.c. Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums. The Romans never really infiltrated Ibiza, and even after the defeat of Hannibal in 202 b.c. during the Second Punic War their influence was restrained. Only with the fall of Carthage in 146 b.c. did they manage to make inroads, but, as local historians stress, Ibiza was neither conquered nor annexed by Rome, but confederated, retaining remarkable autonomy. For centuries to come the old Carthaginian traditions were allowed to continue on Ibiza alongside the new Roman way of life.

The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of \\"parachute payments\\". Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons. Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives £55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams \\"bouncing back\\" soon after their relegation.

Q: Question: What is the middle name of the artist whose breakthrough album \\"Breakaway\\" Chantal wrote for? Passage:Canadian singer-songwriter, producer and pianist Chantal Kreviazuk has written, produced and performed on albums and tracks for a wide range recording artists, spanning from adult contemporary, pop, rock, to indie and hip-hop music. Initially, she began writing her own pop songs, especially after a 1994 motorcycle accident in Italy left her immobile for several months, and was signed by Sony Canada, where she released her debut album in June 1997. Chantal later released another album in 1999, before being featured in a range of soundtracks to films and TV series. Chantal began writing for other artists in 2001, where she co-wrote the song \\"Always and Forever\\" for Eleanor McCain. However, it was only in 2004 that Chantal started writing for more artists and received recognition as a songwriter. In the summer of 2003, Chantal met Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, they formed a relationship of mutual respect and sisterhood, and eventually became songwriting partners. They co-wrote six songs for Lavigne's sophomore album, Under My Skin (2004): \\"Slipped Away,\\" \\"Forgotten,\\" \\"Together,\\" \\"How Does It Feel,\\" \\"He Wasn't\\" and \\"Who Knows.\\" Kreviazuk described \\"He Wasn't\\" as \\"a super-fun, punk, screw-you-to-boys song,\\" while \\"Forgotten\\" is a driving rock song inspired by similarly vibed music Lavigne was consumed with at the time. Also in 2004, Chantal co-wrote \\"Rich Girl\\", for Gwen Stefani's solo debut album, \\"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\\", along with Dr. Dre, Jerry Bock, Mark Batson, Kara DioGuardi, Mike Elizondo, Sheldon Harnick and Eve. The song became a chart success, reaching the top-ten in over fifteen countries. Chantal also wrote for Kelly Clarkson's breakthrough album \\"Breakaway\\" in the end of 2004, sharing writing credits for the tracks \\"Where is Your Heart\\" and \\"Walk Away\\". In 2005, Chantal's co-writing song \\"He Wasn't\\" was released as Lavigne's final single from \\"Under My Skin\\", receiving a moderate impact on the charts and reaching only the top-forty in some countries. While in 2006, Clarkson's \\"Walk Away\\" was released as \\"Breakaway\\"'s final single, reaching the top-twenty in some countries.

Hydrogen and oxygen: These elements are essential for creating water and maintaining the spacecraft's atmosphere, but they do not directly address the astronaut's food needs. 2. Preserved meals: Preserved meals have longer shelf-life and can be specifically tailored for astronauts' nutritional needs during extended flights. These are a suitable option. 3. Solid, liquid, gas: These states of matter are not directly related to an astronaut's food requirement. 4. Small meals: Small meals may help with portion control, but they don't specifically address the need for specialized long-lasting meals. 5. Fresh meals: Fresh meals would lose their freshness over the duration of an extended flight. 6. Dehydration: This is a process used to preserve food by removing water content. While useful, it doesn't directly address meal needs. 7. Nutrients: Ensuring that an astronaut's meals are nutrient-dense is important but doesn't address the need for meal preservation. 8. Surprise meals: Although variety and enjoyment are essential for appetite, this does not address long-lasting meal preservation.

Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th U.S. state on December 11, 1816. Indiana borders Lake Michigan to the northwest, Michigan to the north, Ohio to the east, Kentucky to the south and southeast, and Illinois to the west. Before becoming a territory, varying cultures of indigenous peoples and historic Native Americans inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York, Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and from adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and Tennessee. Indiana has a diverse economy with a gross state product of 341.9 billion in 2016. Indiana has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller industrial cities and towns.

Here is an article: A European mediator flew into Kiev to meet with the Ukrainian government and opposition on Wednesday, but there was no sign of an end to the standoff that has paralysed the centre of the city and the work of the government for days. Thorbjorn Jagland, secretary general of the Council of Europe, was sober about the possibility of progress after meeting with Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, and said he had impressed upon the Ukrainian authorities the need to launch an independent investigation into police violence against peaceful protesters over the weekend. \\"It's important to have an investigation into this that everyone can trust,\\" said Jagland, adding that he hoped to facilitate dialogue between the government and opposition parties. \\"I don't know whether it is possible to have this dialogue,\\" he admitted. Azarov, who was carried through an emotional no-confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday by the support of President Viktor Yanukovych's Party of Regions, criticised the protest movement during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. \\"We must decide all this in a calm environment,\\" he said. \\"Not in the streets, but in a responsible dialogue.\\" However, opposition politicians, including heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko, have called for the government to resign and for snap presidential elections. They say they will continue to blockade government buildings until their demands are met. Demonstrations began after Yanukovych backed away from a trade deal with the EU, citing the importance of ties with Russia. The unrest appeared to be dying down, until riot police cleared Independence square of protesters on Saturday, in violent scenes which provoked a mass protest on Sunday. The square, hub of the 2004 Orange Revolution, remains barricaded and filled with protesters, and the three main opposition parties insist that there can be no negotiations until Yanukovych calls snap elections. Yanukovych himself has left the country for a long-planned visit to China, where he took time out to view the terracotta army on Wednesday, apparently unconcerned by events at home. \\"The big question is whether the opposition can keep people coming to the square, and keep the pressure on, or whether people will get bored,\\" said political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. \\"The next week will show us who the winner is.\\" Russia and the west have accused each other of meddling in Ukraine's internal affairs, with the EU furious that the trade deal, years in the making, was scuppered after apparent pressure from Moscow.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You may be wondering, how can a glacier get so big? Why does it move? These are both good questions. In the winter months, precipitation falls as snow. This solid form of water builds up on the ground as long as the temperatures stay cold enough. As the temperature rises, the snow starts to melt. The frozen water changes state back into a liquid state. Nearer the poles, summer does not last very long. If the summer is long enough and warm enough, all the snow may melt. This is what typically happens now. The earth was a little cooler 12,000 years ago. As a result, during the summer months, that amount of snow did not melt. It may have only been an inch or so of snow that melted. The following winter, snow fell on top of this left-over snow. This next winters snowfall had a head start. Year after year, the snow that did not melt became thicker and thicker. Inch by inch the snow started to build up. Over many years, layer upon layer of snow compacted and turned to ice. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Not moving\\" correctly answer the question \\"What are two characteristics of glaciers?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"Not moving\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What are two characteristics of glaciers?\\" based on the paragraph. The paragraph explains the process of how a glacier gets so big, but it doesn't specifically mention the characteristics of glaciers. To provide an answer for the question, we can discuss two main characteristics of glaciers: size and movement. 1. Size: Glaciers are large masses of ice and snow that have accumulated over time. As described in the paragraph, this accumulation is due to the snowfall during winters and less melting during summers. Layers of snow gradually compact into ice, which continues to accumulate, making glaciers bigger. 2. Movement: Glaciers are known to move. Although the paragraph does not directly address the movement of glaciers, it is an important characteristic. Glaciers move due to the pressure exerted by their own weight and gravity, which causes the ice to deform and flow downhill. This movement can occur on various timescales, ranging from very slow to faster speeds depending on several factors like thickness, temperature, and underlying landscape.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What causes changes when they do not line up accurately?\\" Context: \\"Beginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere. For example, mainland Chile observed DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at 24:00 local time. The time difference between the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could therefore be five hours during the Northern summer, three hours during the Southern summer and four hours a few weeks per year because of mismatch of changing dates.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The primary cause of changes when they do not line up accurately is the lack of synchronization in implementing adjustments, such as Daylight Saving Time (DST), between different regions or countries. In the given context, the beginning and ending dates for DST are not the same in the northern and southern hemispheres, which results in a mismatch. This leads to a varying time difference between countries like the United Kingdom and mainland Chile throughout the year. 1. Step 1: Identify the factors causing changes. In this case, the observation of DST by countries in the northern and southern hemispheres is the primary factor causing changes in time differences. 2. Step 2: Analyze the reasons for the mismatch. Countries in each hemisphere have their own DST schedules to maximize daylight hours during their respective summer months. These schedules depend on their geographic location and do not necessarily align with each other. 3. Step 3: Examine the effect of the mismatch. The mismatch in DST schedules between countries leads to variations in time differences throughout the year, as seen between the United Kingdom and mainland Chile. In conclusion, the lack of synchronization in implementing adjustments like DST between different regions or countries causes changes when they do not line up accurately.

As the wreckage is inspected, Master Sergeant Sam Harper (David \\"Shark\\" Fralick), one of the burnt bodies within, springs to life, kills a sergeant and a major (William Smith), and returns to an inert state after muttering, \\"Don't be afraid, it's only friendly fire!\\"Several weeks later, Sam's body is delivered to his hometown of Twin Rivers, which is preparing for the annual July 4th Independence Day festival. Sam's wife Louise (Anne Tremko) is given custody of the casket containing Sam's remains, which are left in the home of Sam's estranged sister Sally (Leslie Neale), who lives with her patriotic young son, Jody (Christopher Ogden). Sam reanimates in the early hours of the Fourth of July, and proceeds to kill and steal the costume of a perverted Uncle Sam named Willie (Mark Chadwick) who spies on young nudable women undressing in their bedrooms. Sam then makes his way to a cemetery, where he murders two of three juvenile delinquents who had vandalized tombstones, and desecrated an American flag.During the Independence Day celebration, which a corrupt congressman (Robert Forster) is visiting Sam beheads the third delinquent, kills Jody's teacher (who had opposed the Vietnam War) with a hatchet, and shoots Sally's unscrupulous lawyer boyfriend in the head.

In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2-3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6-10%. Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera is not one of the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease.

(Associated Press) Egyptian protesters clash with security forces near Tahrir square, in Cairo, Egypt, Wednesday, Nov. 28, 2012. Egyptian state television says the country's highest appeal court has decided to suspend its... (Associated Press) Judges of the Cassation Court decided in an emergency meeting that they will not return to work until Morsi rescinds his decrees, according to state TV. The country's lower appeals court also decided Wednesday to stop work nationwide. The move followed a defiant statement by the Supreme Constitutional Court that rejected charges made by Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood that it is working to bring down his government. The developments are likely to stoke the political turmoil triggered by Morsi when he issued a constitutional declaration on Thursday that placed him above oversight of any kind, including by the courts, and extended similar protection to parliament's lower chamber and a 100-member panel drafting a new constitution. The constitutional court, which was not included in the suspension, is due to rule Sunday on the legality of the two bodies, which are dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists. A ruling, regardless of which way it goes, would constitute a direct challenge to Morsi, who took office in June as Egypt's first freely elected president but has enraged pro-democracy activists who claim he is acting too much like the authoritarian leader he replaced. The court ruled in June to dissolve parliament's lower chamber, also dominated by Islamists, a decision that Morsi and his Islamist allies described as part of a \\"conspiracy\\" to bring down the regime. A strike by the appeals courts and the rare criticism of the president contained in the Supreme Constitutional Court's statement come a day after at least 200,000 people gathered at Cairo's Tahrir square to protest Morsi's decrees, which also gave him unlimited powers to \\"protect\\" the nation. The size of the protest was reminiscent of some of the larger rallies held in the square during the 18-day uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak's authoritarian regime nearly two years ago. Clashes between some protesters and police continued Wednesday. The liberal opposition has said it would not enter a dialogue with the president about the country's latest political crisis before Morsi rescinded his decrees. They plan another massive rally on Friday. ||||| CAIRO (Reuters) - The assembly writing Egypt’s constitution said it could wrap up a final draft later on Wednesday, a move the Muslim Brotherhood sees as a way out of a crisis over a decree by President Mohamed Mursi that protesters say gives him dictatorial powers. But as Mursi’s opponents staged a sixth day of protests in Tahrir Square, critics said the Islamist-dominated assembly’s bid to finish the constitution quickly could make matters worse. Two people have been killed and hundreds injured in countrywide protest set off by Mursi’s decree. The Brotherhood hopes to end the crisis by replacing Mursi’s controversial decree with an entirely new constitution that would need to be approved in a popular referendum, a Brotherhood official told Reuters. It is a gamble based on the Islamists’ belief that they can mobilize enough voters to win the referendum: they have won all elections held since Hosni Mubarak was toppled from power. But the move seemed likely to deepen divisions that are being exposed in the street. The Muslim Brotherhood and its Islamist allies called for protests on Saturday in Tahrir Square, setting the stage for more confrontation with their opponents, who staged a mass rally there on Tuesday. The constitution is one of the main reasons Mursi is at loggerheads with non-Islamist opponents. They are boycotting the 100-member constitutional assembly, saying the Islamists have tried to impose their vision for Egypt’s future. The assembly’s legal legitimacy has been called into question by a series of court cases demanding its dissolution. Its popular legitimacy has been hit by the withdrawal of members including church representatives and liberals. “We will start now and finish today, God willing,” Hossam el-Gheriyani, the assembly speaker, said at the start of its latest session in Cairo, saying Thursday would be “a great day”. “If you are upset by the decree, nothing will stop it except a new constitution issued immediately,” he said. Three other members of the assembly told Reuters there were plans to put the document to a vote on Thursday. ENTRENCHING AUTHORITARIANISM Just down the road from the meeting convened at the Shura Council, protesters were again clashing with riot police in Tahrir Square. Members of the assembly watched on television as they waited to go into session. “The constitution is in its last phases and will be put to a referendum soon and God willing it will solve a lot of the problems in the street,” said Talaat Marzouk, an assembly member from the Salafi Nour Party, as he watched the images. But Wael Ghonim, a prominent activist whose online blogging helped ignite the anti-Mubarak uprising, said a constitution passed in such circumstances would “entrench authoritarianism”. The constitution is supposed to be the cornerstone of a new, democratic Egypt following Mubarak’s three decades of autocratic rule. The assembly has been at work for six months. Mursi had extended its December 12 deadline by two months - extra time that Gheriyani said was not needed. The constitution will determine the powers of the president and parliament and define the roles of the judiciary and a military establishment that had been at the heart of power for decades until Mubarak was toppled. It will also set out the role of Islamic law, or sharia. The effort to conclude the text quickly marked an escalation, said Nathan Brown, a professor of political science at George Washington University in the United States. “It may be regarded with hostility by a lot of state actors too, including the judiciary,” he said. Leading opposition and former Arab League chief figure Amr Moussa slammed the move. He walked out of the assembly earlier this month. “This is nonsensical and one of the steps that shouldn’t be taken, given the background of anger and resentment to the current constitutional assembly,” he told Reuters. Protesters hit a riot policeman (C) after surrounding him during clashes in front of the U.S Embassy near Tahrir Square in Cairo November 28, 2012. Hundreds of demonstrators were in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a sixth day on Wednesday to demand that President Mohamed Mursi rescind a decree they say gives him dictatorial powers, and two of Egypt's top courts stopped work in protest. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh Once drafted, the constitution will go to Mursi for approval, and he must then put it to a referendum within 15 days, which could mean the vote would be held by mid-December. COURTS DECLARE STRIKE Deepening the crisis further on Wednesday, Egypt’s Cassation and Appeals courts said they would suspend their work until the constitutional court rules on the decree. The judiciary, largely unreformed since the popular uprising that unseated Mubarak, was seen as a major target in the decree issued last Thursday, which extended his powers and put his decisions temporarily beyond legal challenge. “The president wants to create a new dictatorship,” said 38-year-old Mohamed Sayyed Ahmed, an unemployed man, in Tahrir. Showing the depth of distrust of Mursi in parts of the judiciary, a spokesman for the Supreme Constitutional Court, which earlier this year declared void the Islamist-led parliament, said it felt under attack by the president. In a speech on Friday, Mursi praised the judiciary as a whole but referred to corrupt elements he aimed to weed out. “The really sad thing that has pained the members of this court is when the president of the republic joined, in a painful surprise, the campaign of continuous attack on the Constitutional Court,” said the spokesman Maher Samy. Senior judges have been negotiating with Mursi about how to restrict his new powers. Mursi’s administration insists that his actions were aimed at breaking a political logjam to push Egypt more swiftly towards democracy, an assertion his opponents dismiss. The West worries about turbulence in a nation that has a peace treaty with Israel and is now ruled by Islamists they long kept at arms length. Slideshow (20 Images) Trying to ease tensions with judges, Mursi said elements of his decree giving his decisions immunity applied only to matters of “sovereign” importance, a compromise suggested by the judges. A constitution must be in place before a new parliament can be elected, and until that time Mursi holds both executive and legislative powers. An election could take place in early 2013. ||||| Media caption BBC Arabic's Yasmine Abu Khadra met protesters camping in Tahrir Square Judges in Egypt's appeal courts have called a strike in protest at President Mohammed Mursi's recent decree giving himself new powers. The decree, issued last Thursday, gave Mr Mursi powers to take any measures to protect the revolution, and stated that no court could overturn his decisions. The move sparked widespread protests. Meanwhile, the assembly drafting a new Egyptian constitution is expected to vote on a draft on Thursday, officials have said. \\"Tomorrow [Thursday] will be a great day,\\" said the head of the Islamist-dominated assembly, Hossam al-Gheriani. He urged the non-Islamist parties, the syndicate of journalists and Egyptian churches - who walked out of the assembly last week - to return. Once adopted by the assembly, the proposed constitution will then be put to a national referendum.

His backers say the decree was needed to protect the gains of the revolution against a judiciary with deep ties to overthrown President Hosni Mubarak. Appeals courts and the Court of Cassation will halt work until the decree is revoked, the judges say. On Monday, Mr Mursi sought to defuse the crisis by saying the decree granting him new powers was limited in scope. He met senior judges and told them that the measure would be restricted to \\"sovereign matters\\" designed to protect institutions. But judges who attended the meeting said they were not satisfied. They want him to withdraw the measure completely. Protesters who have taken to the streets since the decree was issued last Thursday say Mr Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood has hijacked the revolution. The Constitutional Court - which is not taking part in the strike - has accused Mr Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking revenge for an earlier decision in which the court dissolved parliament. The BBC's Jon Leyne, in Cairo, says the aim of Thursday's vote on the draft constitution could be to pre-empt a Constitutional Court ruling on Sunday which may once again dissolve the assembly. Publishing a constitution in these circumstances would be a deeply inflammatory move, our correspondent says. Many Egyptians are suspicious that the assembly, dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists, wants to impose a constitution that increases the role of Islam in Egypt's government and public life. Anti-Mursi protests were held in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Minya and other Nile Delta cities on Tuesday. Low-level rallies continued in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday. The Brotherhood has organised counter-demonstrations, including one in Egypt's second city, Alexandria, which attracted several thousand participants. The decree bars judges from dissolving the assembly that is drawing up a new constitution. The president is also authorised to take any measures to preserve the revolution, national unity or safeguard national security. Critics say the decree is an attack on the judiciary. ||||| More than 100,000 people took to the streets of Cairo on Tuesday to protest against a decree by the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, that grants him sweeping constitutional powers. Columns of protesters from all over the Egyptian capital descended on Tahrir Square, the focus of the January 2011 revolution, in numbers that rivalled the rallies in the 18-day protest that toppled the authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak. \\"Dictator\\" was the word being used to describe Morsi's new status after last Thursday's decree, which grants immunity for the president from judicial review as well as protecting a controversial constitutional assembly dominated by the group he is affiliated with, the Muslim Brotherhood. \\"Today's protests are to overthrow oppression and stand up to the new dictatorship of Morsi, his decree and a constitution far removed from the revolution,\\" said Haytham Mohamedeen of the Egyptian Revolutionary Socialists movement. \\"He has to back down. The revolution and the streets will dictate what he will do. If he stands in the way of the revolution, he will share the same fate as Mubarak.\\" Other marchers called for Morsi not merely to rescind his decree but to step down from the presidency. The chant of the 2011 revolution – \\"The people want to bring down the regime\\" – was echoed in other major Egyptian cities, including Alexandria and Suez. Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Alexandria and Mansoura were ransacked and in the case of latter, set on fire, prompting the organisation to formally request the armed forces to protect the main headquarters in Mokkatam in Cairo. Security Forces at both scenes had apparently refused to intervene. Clashes also raged in the city of Mahalla between Muslim Brotherhood sympathisers and anti-Morsi protesters, resulting in 300 injuries, while there were also reports of clashes in Port Said. Earlier, police continuously fired teargas near Tahrir Square while fighting raged with protesters who continued to arrive in large numbers. Among them was Mohamed ElBaradei, the former International Atomic Energy Agency chief who has taken on the role of co-ordinator of a national salvation front set up to unite opposition to the Morsi decree. Rami Ghanem, of the National Front for Justice and Democracy, said Morsi's decree had galvanised and united Egypt's disparate opposition groups. \\"Most political movements have joined a salvation front with a united political bureau,\\" he said. \\"What we have failed to do in the past two years, Morsi has achieved with his decree, uniting all of us. \\"Our objection is to the decree, irrespective of which president issued it. Killing continues by the ministry of interior, and governments that do this must be removed. We cannot accept any more transgressions, so this may escalate to peaceful civil disobedience.\\" On Monday night, after a meeting with the supreme judicial authority, the presidency issued a statement clarifying the decree and stating that Morsi would use the new powers only for \\"sovereign matters\\", which is presumed to mean anything that relates to national security. A counter-protest planned by the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups was postponed to avoid confrontation with those inflamed by the perceived power grab. Neither of these concessions was enough to stop the protests. \\"Morsi has no credibility any more,\\" said Mohamed Eissa Moussa, a merchant participating in one of the marches. \\"He must step down. Neither he nor the Muslim Brotherhood can be trusted any more. He is not working for the revolution but for himself and his brotherhood. Had he been different, I would have supported him.\\" Ahmed Bakr, a member of Egypt's union for doctors, said: \\"He has appropriated the revolution, and what's worse, he is claiming it is in the name of the revolution. This is a pivotal moment: if we accept his decree, the revolution is over. \\"This isn't democracy, and their adoption of such a decree is farcical. The Brotherhood have no shame and Morsi is tearing this country apart.\\" Tahrir Square was teeming with people even before the separate marches reached the area early in the evening. Adapted anti-Mubarak chants calling for the heads of Morsi and the Brotherhood reverberated from the city's buildings. However, the Twitter account of the Muslim Brotherhood's official English-language website, Ikhwanweb, seemed unperturbed by the numbers out in protest, first dismissing the \\"low turnout\\" in Tahrir Square and then stating that opposition forces who were pleased with a turnout of 300,000 protesters should brace themselves for the \\"millions\\" that would come out in support of Morsi. \\"On #Jan25, united Egyptians (Islamists, liberals, leftists) revolted against autocracy, supported by millions across country, today is politics,\\" Ikhwanweb tweeted. Morsi, emboldened by his success on the international stage for in reaching a truce between Hamas and Israel, has defended his decree by stating it was necessary to defend the revolution from remnants of the Mubarak regime. It's expected that Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court will issue a statement clarifying its position regarding Morsi's decree Wednesday morning. The number of fatalities in a week of unrest reached four on Tuesday, with news of the death of Fathi Gharib, a member of the Socialist Popular Alliance party, who was reported to have died after inhaling teargas. ||||| Clashes that have been erupting on streets just off Tahrir spilt into the square on Wednesday morning, with canisters falling into the crowd forcing protesters to run and sending clouds of tear gas over the tents housing the demonstrators, television images showed. The outskirts of the square have seen sporadic clashes now entering their ninth day, in what started as an anniversary protest to mark one year since deadly confrontations with police in the same area. The television footage showed masked protesters grabbing tear gas canisters and throwing them back at police in a street close to the US embassy, off Tahrir. On Tuesday, tens of thousands of protesters packed the square in a massive show of force, furious that the Islamist president had issued a decree granting himself sweeping powers. Rallies were also staged in most of Egypt's 27 provinces. At least 100 people were injured in Tuesday's nationwide demonstrations including 21 in Cairo, the health ministry said. At least three people have died in one week of clashes. Meanwhile at least two advisers have quit Mr Morsi's team, according to Reuters. One of them, a Christian, had the title of Mursi's assistant for \\"democratic transformation\\". Like most Egyptians, Samir Morkos only learnt of what was in the decree when it was read on state television late on Thursday, he told the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper. Another adviser, Emad Abdel-Ghaffour, told Reuters he had not been consulted either. Head of the hardline Islamist Nour Party, he is still serving as an adviser on \\"social outreach\\". He is in almost daily contact with Mr Morsi, an aide said. \\"Our opinion was not sought,\\" Abdel-Ghaffour said of the decree, adding that he had reservations on the text, but like other Islamists, was broadly supportive of it. Critics of Mr Morsi's decree fear it puts at risk the entire democratic transformation in Egypt, run for decades by army-backed autocrats. Among other controversial articles, it shields from judicial review decisions taken by Mr Morsi until a new parliament is elected some time next year. The Morsi administration has defended the decree as a temporary step needed to smooth the transition to a new system of government. It guarantees new steps to investigate violence against protesters during the uprising against Mubarak. Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court meanwhile accused President Morsi of taking part in a campaign against the court. \\"The really sad thing that has pained the members of this court is when the president of the republic joined, in a painful surprise, the campaign of continuous attack on the Constitutional Court,\\" said the court's spokesman, Maher Samy. Source: agencies ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The situation in Egypt remains heated as protests against Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi's recent decree, granting him sweeping constitutional powers, continue unabated. Tens of thousands of demonstrators reportedly descended on Tahrir Square, the centerpiece site of the 2011 revolution, characterizing the president's new level of authority as dictatorial. The resulting nation-wide protests have led to hundreds of injuries and claimed several lives. President Morsi's actions have also resulted in division within the government. Both the Cassation Court and Appeals courts have declared a strike, claiming they will not return to work until Morsi's decree is rescinded. This decision from the judiciary system comes on the heels of a Supreme Constitutional Court statement that denied allegations by Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood that the court is conspiring to topple his government. The Constitutional Court, however, was not included in the suspension and is set to rule on the legality of two bodies dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood, including a 100-member panel responsible for drafting a new constitution. Parallel to this, the assembly responsible for writing Egypt's new constitution announced expectations of completing a final draft. However, critics argued that rushing the constitution could likely worsen the current situation. The Muslim Brotherhood believes replacing Morsi's controversial decree with a new constitution, followed by a popular referendum could potentially end the current crisis. But given the prevailing bitterness and suspicion amongst non-Islamist opponents, this move may deepen divides further. Opponents of Morsi's decree continue to protest due to the fear that the constitution, expected to be the cornerstone of a new democratic Egypt, will unintentionally increase the role of Islam in the nation's government and public life. In response to the ongoing unrest, the Muslim Brotherhood scheduled a counter-protest rally in support of Morsi and his efforts. Despite these sustained protests, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood stay firm on their stand, noting the decree, which was seen necessary to protect the gains of the revolution. In response to the backlash, the presidency issued a statement clarifying the decree and indicating that Morsi would only use his new powers for \\"sovereign matters,\\" presumably relating to national security. However, this clarification has done little to dampen the anger of protesters who continue to insist that Morsi has hijacked the revolution. This ongoing crisis exposes the deep divisions within Egypt and poses serious challenges to its democratic transition. It is clear that the nation stands at a critical juncture, where its democratic future hangs in the balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf can be considered as critics of artistic works, but they focused on different types of art and have distinct backgrounds. Pauline Kael (1919-2001) was an American film critic who gained prominence for her insightful, witty, and sometimes controversial reviews. She wrote for various publications, including The New Yorker, where she was a regular contributor for over two decades. Kael is known for her engaging writing style and her ability to analyze films with both intellectual rigor and emotional depth. As a critic of artistic works, her primary focus was on cinema. Christa Wolf (1929-2011), on the other hand, was a German author and literary critic. She is best known for her novels and essays, which often engage with political and social issues, particularly in the context of East Germany during the Cold War. While her primary focus was literature, her work as a critic also extended to other artistic genres, including theatre. Wolf's critical writings centered on evaluating and interpreting artistic works as reflections of societal values and cultural shifts. In summary, both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf were critics of artistic works. Kael primarily focused on film criticism, while Wolf's criticism encompassed literature and other art forms, often in relation to their social and political contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identification of the main issue: The user identifies heat as their primary concern with the product. They mention that the drive runs \\"very hot\\" and there is no built-in cooling mechanism. 2. User's effort to resolve the issue: The user tries to solve the issue themselves by opening the case, drilling holes, and attaching a fan. This indicates that the product did not meet their expectations in terms of thermal management. 3. Outcome after the user's solution: While the drive runs cooler after the user's modifications, it has become noisy as a result. Justification: Based on the three steps described above, the product review can be considered negative because the user's main concern was not addressed by the manufacturer, and they had to take the initiative to resolve it themselves.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose your answer from: 1. no; 2. yes;","completion":"1. no First, let me explain the difference between these questions: 1. The first question, \\"Why is supply-side economics considered Reaganomics?\\" asks for a clarification on why supply-side economics is associated with the economic policies of US President Ronald Reagan. 2. The second question, \\"Does supply-side economics (Reaganomics) work?\\" inquires about the effectiveness and validity of the economics approach proposed by supply-side economics and its association with Reaganomics. Now, let's address each question step by step: 1. Supply-side economics is considered Reaganomics because it was the primary economic policy during Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s. These policies focused on reducing taxes, decreasing regulations, and promoting economic growth through stimulating the supply side of the economy. The implementation of these policies aimed to boost the production capabilities of businesses and increase national output. As a result, the term \\"Reaganomics\\" emerged as a way to describe the economic policies of the Reagan administration that heavily relied on the ideas of supply-side economics. 2. The effectiveness of supply-side economics (Reaganomics) as a policy approach is a matter of debate among economists. Proponents of supply-side economics argue that it helped to reduce inflation, stimulate economic growth, and create jobs during the 1980s. They specifically point to the economic recovery that followed the recession of the early 1980s. However, critics argue that supply-side economics led to increasing income inequality, high budget deficits, and ultimately did not achieve its primary goal of broad-based economic growth for all income levels. They also argue that other factors unrelated to supply-side policies, such as decreasing oil prices and monetary policies, contributed to the economic recovery during the Reagan era. As you can see, the questions are different in nature, the first asking about the reasoning behind the association between supply-side economics and Reaganomics and the second asking about the effectiveness of these policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Only 300 took an active part in the rebellion. although the Hamburg KPD numbered some 14,000 members. On 23 October at 5:00 a.m., they stormed 26 police precincts and took weapons from 17 of them. There was also activity in Altona and the urban district of Stormarn, where the police stations in Schiffbek and Bramfeld were attacked and weapons taken. In Bad Oldesloe, Ahrensburg and Rahlstedt, train tracks and streets were blockaded. In the town of Bargteheide, insurgents arrested local government leaders and proclaimed the \\"Soviet Republic of Stormarn\\". In Schiffbek, where the KPD had support, placards were posted to calm residents and to urge support for the uprising, declaring \\"Long live Soviet Germany!

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What kind of disability does Kyle have? Movie title: After Thomas Movie plot: Kyle Graham (Andrew Byrne) is scared. Not of monsters under the bed like any average six-year-old but of everything. Normal, everyday activities prove terrifying to him. He canât communicate his fears or share them with friends, because he canât use language and he has no friends. Kyle has autism, a condition it took his parents two desperate years to get diagnosed. So his day consists of endless traumas and tantrumsâ¦ and unimaginable stress for his mother Nicola (Keeley Hawes). Nicola knows that the one thing Kyle wants is to be left alone, safe and secure in his autistic world. But she also knows that if she grants her son this wish, he will have no future. Her fierce determination to break into Kyleâs world at any cost has placed an intolerable strain on her marriage. Her husband Rob (Ben Miles), although equally unbending in his love for his son, is frustrated by Nicolaâs relentless challenging of Kyle. Not to mention the loss of the carefree life he and Nicola once had. Rob tries everything to convince Nicola that Kyle should go to bruce house school, a boarding school for autistic children. But Nicola is adamant that he should remain part of society and be taught the skills to cope with the world around him. When a âno-strings attachedâ respite is offered by family friend Rachel (Lorraine Pilkington), Rob is truly torn. Nicolaâs only respite is the unwavering support of her mother Pat (Sheila Hancock) and father Jim (Duncan Preston), who dote on Kyle and provide practical support when needed. Into this setting of seemingly insurmountable conflict comes Thomas, a golden retriever puppy, named after Kyleâs favourite character, Thomas The Tank Engine. Nicola is hopeful that Thomas can break into Kyleâs world where everyone else has failed. Rob says that loads of kids with autism are terrified of dogs, but Kyle seems fine with a dog sitting on him. Little by little, Kyle begins to show Thomas affection and an understanding of his new dogâs feeling. By the time Thomas is a fully grown... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"After Thomas,\\" Kyle Graham, portrayed by Andrew Byrne, has autism. Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a developmental disability characterized by difficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive or restrictive behaviors. This can manifest itself in a wide range of possible symptoms, which vary greatly in severity and intensity from person to person. In Kyle's case, he experiences extreme fear and anxiety in daily activities and has difficulty using language to communicate his thoughts and emotions. The movie's plot centers around Nicola, Kyle's mother, who is determined to help her son break free from his isolation and integrate into the world at large. Her approach has caused strain in her marriage, as her husband Rob believes that Kyle should attend a boarding school specifically designed for autistic children. However, Nicola is insistent on keeping Kyle in mainstream society and teaching him the skills required to navigate the world around him. The introduction of Thomas, a Golden Retriever puppy, creates a breakthrough in the story. Thomas is named after Kyle's favorite character, Thomas the Tank Engine. Despite many children with autism being afraid of dogs, Kyle exhibits no fear of Thomas and even begins to show him affection. Gradually, the bond between Kyle and Thomas helps to open up Kyle's world, allowing him to better understand and interact with others. The presence of Thomas serves as a catalyst, providing a newfound sense of hope for Kyle and his family. As you consider investing in this film proposal, you may want to evaluate several factors. These include the quality of the script, the actors and director involved, the audience demand for a film with this theme, and the potential return on investment. Additionally, the movie's depiction of autism and the struggles faced by those affected and their families could raise awareness about the condition and help to encourage empathy and understanding in the audience, thus contributing to social change."},{"prompt":"Q:Title: Lose the DRM Product review: I love the Kindle, but the true idea of books is the free exchange of ideas and using DRM on this device is unacceptable.

Learn how to read guitar tabs.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Managing Finger Pain and Mastering Guitar Tabs: A Comprehensive Guide for Guitarists Introduction: For many guitarists, finger pain and muscle strain can hinder progress as they strive to improve their skills. The ability to read guitar tabs is an essential aspect of guitar playing, enabling musicians to learn new songs and techniques more efficiently. In this article, we will explore several effective methods to relieve finger pain and master reading guitar tabs, empowering you to unleash your full potential on the instrument. Step 1: Understanding the Cause of Finger Pain: The primary cause of finger pain among guitarists is the act of pressing down on the strings to create chords or individual notes. Repetitive strain from this pressure, combined with the unfamiliar motions of your fingers, can lead to discomfort and even injury. To manage finger pain effectively, it's crucial to understand your playing habits and identify the sources of discomfort. As a guitarist, it is wise to develop good playing habits from the outset, such as maintaining a proper hand position and using the right amount of pressure on the strings. Step 2: Reducing Finger Pain Through Proper Technique: To minimize the likelihood of finger pain, follow these guidelines when playing the guitar: 1. Maintain a relaxed hand posture: Ensure that your fingers and hand remain relaxed when not actively pressing on the strings. This helps prevent unnecessary tension and strain. 2. Use the fingertips: When fretting notes, use the tips of your fingers to apply pressure, rather than the pads. This allows for more precise intonation and reduces strain on your fingers. 3. Apply appropriate pressure: Use only the necessary amount of pressure to produce a clear sound. Too much force can lead to finger pain and hinder your playing. 4. Take breaks: Regular breaks during practice sessions can alleviate finger strain and help you maintain focus. Step 3: Cultivating a Mindful Practice Routine: To foster optimal finger health and bolster your guitar skills, establish a consistent practice routine. This includes incorporating finger-strengthening exercises, paying attention to discomfort indicators, and committing to daily warm-up and cool-down sessions to prepare your fingers and prevent muscle strains. Step 4: Learning to Read Guitar Tabs: Guitar tabs, or tablatures, are a simplified notation system that represents the frets and strings on a guitar. They enable musicians to understand and play a piece without requiring formal knowledge of music theory or standard notation. To read guitar tabs, follow these guidelines: 1. Guitar tab layout: Tabs feature six horizontal lines representing each string of the guitar, with the top line corresponding to the high E string and the bottom line representing the low E string. 2. Fret numbers: Numbers placed on these lines indicate the frets where you should place your fingers on the corresponding strings. 3. Chords and individual notes: When numbers are stacked vertically, they signify a chord that should be played simultaneously. When numbers appear sequentially, they represent individual notes that are played one after another. 4. Techniques and symbols: Certain symbols provide additional information about playing techniques, such as slides, bends, hammer-ons, and pull-offs. Step 5: Applying Your Knowledge: With proper finger care and a strong understanding of guitar tabs, you're now equipped to tackle any song or technique you desire. Practice regularly, maintain proper playing habits, and persistently challenge yourself to unlock your full potential as a guitarist. Conclusion: Managing finger pain and mastering guitar tabs are integral steps to becoming a proficient guitarist. By developing healthy habits, maintaining correct playing techniques, and confidently interpreting tablature, you'll enhance your guitar journey and enjoy the rich rewards of this versatile instrument."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that created the G minor Piano Sonata? By the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist. Answer:","completion":"Smetana"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given these facts, what lack a centralized nervous system among the following options: - barnacles - nervous fish - insects - bees - Pesticides - alpacas - fish - starfish Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, starfish lack a centralized nervous system. Echinoderms, such as starfish, are a group of marine animals characterized by their radial symmetry, spiny skin and unique water vascular system. Despite not having a centralized nervous system, echinoderms possess a network of nerves that provide them with the necessary functionality to effectively respond to their environment. This network of nerves is organized into two primary parts: the ectoneural system, which is mainly responsible for sensory input, and the hyponeural system, which controls muscle movement. In starfish, the nervous system consists of a nerve ring near the center of their body, as well as several radial nerve cords that extend down each of their arms. These nerves interconnect with one another, allowing the starfish to coordinate its movements and respond to stimuli, despite not having a centralized brain or other dominant control center. The diffuse nature of their nervous system enables starfish to regenerate their body parts and continue functioning even after suffering considerable damage or losing an arm. On the other hand, most of the other options provided are animals that do possess a centralized nervous system: 1. Barnacles - These are crustaceans and have a more centralized nervous system, with a brain, ventral nerve cords, and ganglia that control their various body functions. 2. Nervous fish - This term doesn't specify a particular species, but all fish have a centralized nervous system that includes a brain and an extended spinal cord. 3. Insects - All insects have a centralized nervous system consisting of a brain and a ventral nerve cord with connected ganglia that direct movements and responses to stimuli. 4. Bees - Bees are a type of insect and, as previously mentioned, insects do have a centralized nervous system. 5. Alpacas - These mammals possess a central nervous system, including a well-developed brain and spinal cord. 6. Fish - Fish belong to the group vertebrates, which all have a centralized nervous system composed of a brain and spinal cord. In the context of this question, \\"Pesticides\\" does not fit within the same category as the other options, since it refers to a group of chemicals used to control pests such as insects and weeds.

Countless homes were destroyed and lots of people became homeless after the earthquake which is believed to have a magnitude of 7. The quake was not as serious as the 7.9-magnitude earthquake in 2008 that left more than 70,000 people dead in the Wenchuan area.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who received his first musical education from his paternal grandfather? from the following article ? Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti).

Tierney was born on November 19, 1920 in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Howard Sherwood Tierney and Belle Lavinia Taylor. She was named after a beloved uncle, who died young. She had an elder brother, Howard Sherwood \\"Butch\\" Tierney, Jr., and a younger sister, Patricia \\"Pat\\" Tierney. Their father was a successful insurance broker of Irish descent, their mother a former physical education instructor. Tierney had reportedly started smoking after a screening of her first movie to lower her voice, because she felt, \\"I sound like an angry Minnie Mouse.\\" She subsequently became a heavy smoker. With difficult events in her personal life, Tierney struggled for years with episodes of manic depression. In 1943, she gave birth to a daughter, Daria, who was deaf and mentally disabled, the result of a fan breaking a rubella quarantine and infecting the pregnant Tierney while she volunteered at the Hollywood Canteen. In 1953, she suffered problems with concentration, which affected her film appearances. She dropped out of Mogambo and was replaced by Grace Kelly. While playing Anne Scott in The Left Hand of God (1955), opposite Humphrey Bogart, Tierney became ill. Bogart's sister Frances (known as Pat) had suffered from mental illness, so he showed Tierney great sympathy, feeding her lines during the production and encouraging her to seek help. Tierney consulted a psychiatrist and was admitted to Harkness Pavilion in New York. Later, she went to the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut. After some 27 shock treatments, intended to alleviate severe depression, Tierney fled the facility, but was caught and returned. She later became an outspoken opponent of shock treatment therapy, claiming it had destroyed significant portions of her memory. In late December 1957, Tierney, from her mother's apartment in Manhattan, stepped onto a ledge 14 stories above ground and remained for about 20 minutes in what was considered a suicide attempt. Police were called, and afterwards Tierney's family arranged for her to be admitted to the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas. The following year, after treatment for depression, she was released. Afterwards, she worked as a sales girl in a local dress shop with hopes of integrating back into society, but she was recognized by a customer, resulting in sensational newspaper headlines. Later in 1958, 20th Century-Fox offered Tierney a lead role in Holiday for Lovers (1959), but the stress upon her proved too great, so only days into production, she dropped out of the film and returned to Menninger for a time.

Plot: In a bustling metropolis plagued by crime and violence, two parallel stories of deceit and intrigue unfurl, both fueled by the dark underworld of organized crime. This thrilling tale employs a parallel storytelling structure, following the double life of two main characters in an intense game of cat and mouse. On one side, we have Michael, a determined undercover cop who has infiltrated the city's feared crime syndicate, led by the ruthless and mysterious Mr. X. Michael's ultimate goal is to put an end to their illegal activities and help restore peace to the city. However, Michael struggles with the blurred line between his duty as a police officer and the intense camaraderie he experiences with his fellow criminals. Meanwhile, we also witness the story of Tony, a top member of Mr. X's syndicate who has secretly infiltrated the city's police force. Tony has been placed there with the intention of feeding information back to the crime syndicate to keep them one step ahead of the law. But as time goes by, Tony encounters acts of kindness, righteousness, and bravery from his fellow officers, causing him to question his allegiances and true purpose. Throughout the film, both characters face challenges and moral dilemmas, as well as moments of triumph and heart-wrenching loss. Along the way, they encounter intriguing subplots and supporting characters in both worlds, with Detective Reese, the relentless lead investigator, and Angela, Mr. X's daughter, who eventually becomes a love interest for Michael. As the story progresses, tension builds as both Michael and Tony begin to discover each other's true identities. This leads to a dramatic climax in which they must choose where their loyalties truly lie – with their respective institutions or with the friendships they have forged. In the end, Michael and Tony face off in a desperate, cathartic struggle that results in the fall of the crime syndicate and its leader. However, the sacrifices they made along the way will forever haunt them – as the film ultimately begs the question of whether the high price of justice was truly worth the cost. \\"Double Echoes\\" serves as a powerful exploration of morality, loyalty, and the complexities of human relationships.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Stagolee stayed in the Billboard Hot 100 for several weeks","completion":"To draw the conclusion that \\"Stagolee stayed in the Billboard Hot 100 for several weeks,\\" we need to analyze the information provided step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the song and its history - The song in question is \\"Stagger Lee\\" or \\"Stagolee,\\" a popular American folk song about a real-life event. Step 2: Identify the song's publication and first recording - The song was first published in 1911 and first recorded in 1923 by Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians. Step 3: Identify the song's presence in Billboard Hot 100 - A version of the song by Lloyd Price reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959.

No student who read anything passed.","completion":"A linguist would most likely consider the sentence \\"No student who read anything passed\\" to be grammatically correct according to the rules and conventions of the English language. However, the sentence may be ambiguous or potentially misleading, and the intended meaning might not be immediately clear to all readers. In this sentence, the structure and word order are in line with English grammar rules. It employs a negative statement (\\"No student\\") followed by a restrictive relative clause (\\"who read anything\\") and a main clause (\\"passed\\"). The negative statement sets the scope of the sentence, while the restrictive relative clause provides additional information about the subject (in this case, \\".student\\"). Let's break down the sentence structure: 1. \\"No student\\" serves as the negative subject which refers to a group of people who did not fulfill a certain condition, and \\"passed\\" stands as the predicate, which denotes the action or state of the subject. 2. \\"who read anything\\" is the restrictive relative clause, further defining or providing more specific information about the subject, \\"student.\\" It is essential for understanding the context and is introduced by the relative pronoun \\"who.\\" Given these elements, the sentence is grammatically correct. However, the meaning might be confusing or ambiguous for some readers, particularly because it appears to be a double-negative statement. Generally, a double-negative statement can be challenging to understand because it can be interpreted differently depending on context and reader's perception. Regarding the meaning of this particular sentence, there are various potential interpretations: 1. No student who read any material was able to pass: This could indicate that reading led students to fail or that students who read perhaps misunderstood the material. 2. Students who did not read anything passed: Here, the implication might be that students who chose not to read somehow managed to succeed. 3. None of the students who read passed, but the sentence doesn't provide information about the ones who didn't read: This interpretation leaves open the question of whether or not students who didn't read the material passed. To clarify the intended meaning, it would be helpful to rephrase the sentence or add further context. For example, \\"None of the students who read anything were able to pass the exam\\" could provide a clearer indication of what the speaker or writer means. In conclusion, while the sentence \\"No student who read anything passed\\" is grammatically correct according to the rules of English grammar, its meaning is ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways. To ensure clear communication and accurately convey the intended message, it is often necessary to rephrase ambiguous sentences like this one."},{"prompt":"Question: In China, people usually set off firecrackers to celebrate Spring Festival.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group.

Penderyn whiskey is made in which European country","completion":"Penderyn whiskey is made in the European country of Wales, which is one of the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom, alongside England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Wales is located to the west of England and is known for its stunning landscapes, rich history, and distinctive culture. Welsh distilleries have a long history of producing high-quality alcoholic beverages, including whiskey. Penderyn Distillery, the producer of Penderyn whiskey, is situated in the picturesque village of Penderyn in the Brecon Beacons National Park. This area is renowned for its natural beauty and pristine water sources, which play a crucial role in the whiskey-making process. The distillery was originally founded in 2000 and began producing whiskey in 2004, becoming the first distillery in Wales in over a century. Penderyn whiskey is made using traditional distilling methods combined with innovative techniques. They utilize a unique single copper-pot still design created by Dr. David Faraday – a descendant of the famous scientist, Michael Faraday. This innovative still allows for a more refined and smoother spirit, as it effectively distills the alcohol three times in one process. To make Penderyn whiskey, the distillery starts with the finest barley, which is then malted and milled to create a smooth, consistent mash. This mash is mixed with water sourced from the nearby Brecon Beacons to create a mixture called wort. The wort is then fermented with yeast, producing a liquid with a low alcohol content known as wash. Next, the wash is transferred to the unique Faraday still, where it is heated and carefully distilled. The alcohol vapors rise up the column of the still and condense into a high-proof spirit, which is then collected and aged in wooden casks. Penderyn Distillery uses a variety of cask types, including American oak bourbon barrels, European oak sherry casks, and ex-peated Scotch casks. Each cask type imparts unique flavors and characteristics to the whiskey as it matures. The maturation process typically lasts for several years, during which the whiskey evolves and develops a range of complex flavors and textures. Once the spirit reaches the desired level of maturity, Penderyn's master blender carefully selects and blends casks to achieve the desired flavor profile and balance. The whiskey is then bottled and made available for consumption, both within Wales and internationally. Penderyn whiskey has garnered global acclaim and has earned numerous awards, establishing itself as a leading player in the world of spirits. Its range of whiskies offers diverse taste experiences, reflecting the craftsmanship, innovation, and dedication to quality that makes the brand special. Whether you are a casual whiskey enthusiast or a connoisseur looking to expand your palate, Penderyn whiskey is definitely worth exploring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Context: Biliary strictures are a serious cause of morbidity after liver transplantation. We have studied the role of altered bile composition as a mechanism of bile duct injury after human liver transplantation.', 'In 28 liver transplant recipients, bile samples were collected daily posttransplantation for determination of bile composition. Hepatic expression of bile transporters was studied before and after transplantation. Histopathological criteria as well as biliary concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) were used to quantify bile duct injury.', 'Early after transplantation, bile salt secretion increased more rapidly than phospholipid secretion, resulting in high biliary bile salt/phospholipid ratio (BA/PL). In parallel with this, mRNA levels of the bile salt transporters NTCP and BSEP increased significantly after transplantation, whereas phospholipid translocator MDR3 mRNA levels remained unchanged. Bile duct injury correlated significantly with bile salt secretion and was associated with a high biliary BA/PL ratio. Answer: Bile salt secretion after human liver transplantation recovers more rapidly than phospholipid secretion. This results in cytotoxic bile formation and correlates with bile duct injury. These findings suggest that endogenous bile salts have a role in the pathogenesis of bile duct injury after liver transplantation.

Article: There is disagreement about the origin of the term, but general consensus that \\"cardinalis\\" from the word cardo (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244. Question: What was it that gave cardinals the right to elect the pope?","completion":"Cardinals were given the right to elect the pope through the Papal Bull \\"In nomine Domini,\\" which was issued during the pontificate of Pope Nicholas II in 1059. Before this, various methods of selecting the pope were in practice, often involving political interference from secular powers. The introduction of the Papal Bull \\"In nomine Domini\\" was a significant moment in the history of the Catholic Church, as it established the College of Cardinals as the exclusive electors of the pope, giving them the power to influence papal succession, and thus, the direction of the church. This decision was made in an effort to reduce the influence of external political forces on the process of electing the head of the church and to allow for a more impartial and spiritually guided election. At first, this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops; however, the Third Lateran Council in 1179 restored this right to the entire body of cardinals, ensuring that the election process would be more inclusive and representative. In addition to being granted the privilege of electing the pope, cardinals also played significant roles in the administration of the church of Rome and the papal liturgy. They constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy and even had the exclusive eligibility of becoming the pope themselves, based on the decree of a synod in 769. Furthermore, in recognition of their elevated status within the Catholic Church, Pope Innocent IV granted cardinals the privilege of wearing the red hat in 1244, symbolizing the blood they would be willing to shed for the church. The tradition of the red hat continues to be a characteristic element of cardinal attire today. In summary, the Papal Bull \\"In nomine Domini\\" issued during the pontificate of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 conferred the right to elect the pope upon the cardinals, solidifying their central role in determining the leadership and direction of the Catholic Church."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

This is because there are fewer particles (balls) in his container compared to Sara's. With fewer particles, there will be fewer collisions occurring in the container, resulting in lower pressure exerted against the walls of the container.

CLOSE Members of 20 different fire departments were on hand to make sure the fire didn't spread to other units. Doug Raflik/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin Buy Photo Apartment building 109 of the Village Glen Apartments in Beaver Dam was set ablaze under a watchful eye from area fire departments because dangerous chemicals were still present after explosions on March 5, 7 and 8 made it unsafe to try to salvage the building, officials said, citing the risk of another explosion or chemical exposure to workers. Doug Raflik/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo BEAVER DAM - The man who died in an explosion in his Beaver Dam apartment last month had white supremacist material along with an array of explosive chemicals, guns and ammunition, according to search warrants unsealed in Dodge County. Benjamin D. Morrow, 28, of Beaver Dam, was killed when his unit in Village Glen Apartments' building 109 exploded on March 5. There were no other deaths or injuries. In search warrants released Thursday, investigators found that Morrow had a \\"homemade explosives laboratory\\" in the apartment. They found his body in the kitchen by the stove, which had a burner on. RELATED: FBI examining background of man who died in apartment explosion RELATED: Beaver Dam apartment burn a success; some personal items retrieved Morrow, who had a background in chemistry, had jars and bottles of chemicals used to make bombs, as well as what appeared to be finished explosives in the apartment. There also were instructions on how to make bombs as well as timers and gunpowder, the warrant said. Agents also recovered at least three long guns, two handguns, more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition, a ballistic helmet and vest, and masks from his apartment, the warrant says. Among the items recovered in a search of Morrow's apartment was literature concerning white supremacist groups. The warrant does not provide details about the groups or other specifics. Officials declined to provide more details than what was in the warrants. The discovery of the white supremacist material, in part, prompted agents to search computers and other electronics to see if Morrow was acting alone or in concert with others. Department of Justice Special Agent Kevin Heimerl said in the warrant that someone with the kind of material found in Morrow's apartment may be acting alone to \\"commit some type of attacks with those explosives.\\" But people also may work with others to conduct surveillance and carry out attacks in concert with accomplices, Heimerl said. Beaver Dam Lt. of Detectives Terrence Gebhardt said investigators are not seeking other individuals but the investigation remains open to follow leads. He did not elaborate. Dodge County District Attorney Kurt Klomberg said no one has been referred to his office for prosecution. CLOSE The explosive materials were too volatile to remove so they needed to be detonated in the apartment. Doug Raflik/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin Officials also searched a storage locker rented by Morrow but found nothing of importance to the investigation. Morrow saw the owner of the storage company the day of the explosion and told her he would be moving his items out by the end of March. A native of Black Creek, Morrow had worked at Richelieu Foods in Beaver Dam for 10 months before his death. His co-workers reported that Morrow often came to work smelling like mothballs, which investigators said could have been an attempt to disguise the odor of working with explosive material. Morrow previously worked as a scientist at PPD Inc. in Madison, a research company specializing in drug development, from 2014 until last year. Morrow went to Pensacola Christian College in Florida, graduating in 2013 with a degree in pre-pharmacy and minors in chemistry and math. After the explosion that killed Morrow, a controlled detonation was conducted March 7 in an effort to eliminate remaining chemicals, and a smaller explosion occurred the following day. When the controlled detonation failed to eliminate the threat, authorities took the unusual step of burning the 16-unit apartment building on March 15. Officials said the presence of dangerous chemicals on-site made it unsafe to try to salvage the building, citing the risk of another explosion or chemical exposure to workers. As part of the preparation for the burn, bomb techs from the FBI removed ammunition and hazardous materials from the building. During that sweep, bomb techs also retrieved some property in other units, including important papers, jewelry, money and other family heirlooms. That was a change from an earlier position taken by authorities, which called for no one to retrieve personal items for the roughly 30 other residents from the building prior to its burn. Klomberg, the district attorney, said the decision to burn the building was correct but it was very difficult to see residents have \\"much of their lives burned up.\\" \\"It was one of the most heart-wrenching things that I have been involved in,\\" he said. Read or Share this story: https://fondul.ac/2GB9Hmy ||||| Benjamin Morrow was found dead with white supremacist literature and the ingredients for a notorious bomb known as the “Mother of Satan.” Morrow, 28, died in an explosion in the kitchen of his Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, apartment on March 5. His home was filled with bomb-making substances so volatile that firefighters chose to destroy the 16-unit apartment block in a controlled blaze, rather than let Morrow’s neighbors continue to live in the building. A search warrant unsealed last week revealed that Morrow kept white supremacist literature in his home. Investigators’ application for a second warrant suggests that Morrow had plans, announcing that he was clearing out a rented storage locker just hours before his death. Kevin Heimerl of the Wisconsin Department of Justice called Morrow’s apartment a “homemade explosives laboratory.” When they responded to reports of an explosion at the home, investigators passed “a one gallon metal container of acetone,” an investigator told a judge in a newly unsealed warrant application. Acetone is an explosive substance and ingredient in the “Mother of Satan”: a volatile bomb used by terrorists in ISIS attacks in Manchester, England, and Paris, France, in recent years. Also sitting in plain sight where two white cardboard boxes stamped with the words “mix it, shake it, shoot it,” and three more packages labeled “sonic boom,” Heimerl testified, adding that he suspected the boxes contained materials that would explode when combined. Investigators also found pipes and pipe caps in the apartment. When they entered the kitchen, investigators found Morrow dead in front of a still-lit stove. An “overpressure blast” had destroyed much of the room, blowing out the doors and windows and burying Morrow under the collapsed ceiling. Containers with more chemicals were spilling out an open refrigerator door. The scene was so volatile that authorities barred the rest of the apartment building’s residents from re-entering their homes, and burned the entire building to the ground in a 1,600-degree controlled blaze overseen by 100 firefighters. Residents left their valuables inside. One of Morrow’s neighbors told the Wisconsin State Journal he planned on digging through the rubble to find a dead relative’s World War II dog tags, which had been left inside to burn. At the time of the fire, the contents of Morrow’s apartment remained a mystery. But an unsealed warrant describes Morrow as building a terrifying arsenal. In addition to more bomb-making materials, Morrow also had a collection of guns and accessories including a rifle scope, masks, vests, a ballistic helmet, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Morrow also had “white supremacist material” in his bedroom, the warrant said. Beaver Dam police said the white supremacist literature didn’t necessarily mean Morrow was a white supremacist. “It does cause me some concern but I want to make very clear just because Mr. Morrow was in the possession of this material, does not categorize in any particular light,” Lt. Terrence Gebhardt told CBS 58. “He could have been an individual that was doing research.” But state investigators suggested the opposite. In an application for a search warrant, Heimerl raised the possibility that Morrow had worked with or been inspired by others, pointing to the white supremacist literature when a judge asked about “propaganda that raises concern for this kind of collaborative work.” The investigator who swept Morrow’s room described the literature as relating to white supremacist groups that “will involve multiple members” in potentially violent activities. He did not specify which groups were named in the literature. Members of Morrow’s church community have pushed back on the idea that Morrow built the bombs in his bedroom and kitchen, for which investigators found handwritten instructions. “I’d love to defend Ben because he has been described as a bomb maker and he’s not a bomb maker,” Rev. Jerry Marsden, the pastor who conducted Morrow’s funeral told the Associated Press. “He wasn’t a recluse as some have said he is. He was far from that.” In an obituary, Morrow’s family described him as a religious man, who grew up homeschooled and later studied pre-pharmacy, math, and chemistry at Pensacola Christian College in Florida. The search warrant revealed Morrow had a Bible among his white supremacist literature and bomb-making material. When he wasn’t building bombs, he worked as a quality control technician at Richelieu Foods, according to his LinkedIn profile. His coworkers told investigators Morrow sometimes came to work with an unpleasant smell on his clothes. “Some of those co-workers reported that it was common for Benjamin Morrow to arrive for work and he had an odor emitting from his person that co-worker’s described as smelling like moth balls,” Heimerl told a judge in an application for a second warrant. “Those co-workers further stated that they had made comments to Benjamin Morrow about the fact that they could smell moth balls on him.” Mothballs are made of flammable chemicals, which may explain the smell. The second warrant application reveals that police were interested in the contents of a storage unit Morrow rented. On the morning of the fatal explosion, Morrow visited the storage company “and notified the business that he would be moving his personal property out of the storage unit by the end of March,” Heimerl told the judge in the warrant application, speculating that Morrow might have rented the storage unit to keep strong-smelling chemicals from his home. The second warrant, the findings of which are not public, also extend to Morrow’s computers, flash drives, and phone. The records could reveal where Morrow received the white supremacist literature—and whether he was acting alone. “I am aware that a person could work solely to connect this type of manufacturing homemade explosives themselves,” Heimerl said. “But I am also equally aware that individuals oftentimes communicate, inspire and engage with other persons to manufacture homemade explosives.” ||||| Explosive chemicals, white supremacist material found in apartment of man killed in Beaver Dam explosion To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video BEAVER DAM, Wis. (CBS 58) – Newly unsealed search warrants are detailing what investigators found inside the Beaver Dam apartment where police say they found bomb-making materials. On March 5, officials were called to an apartment complex on Knaup Drive for an explosion. Inside, they found 28-year-old Benjamin Morrow dead and volatile chemicals inside the apartment. Investigators call Morrow’s apartment a “homemade explosive laboratory and in addition to bomb-making equipment, they found literature about white supremacist groups in his bedroom. According to the court documents, Morrow was found dead in front of the stove, which was on, and investigators testified they believe he was making explosive at the time of the blast. Inside the apartment, investigators found a fridge full of homemade explosives along with other explosive chemicals, pipes, fuses, and chemistry equipment. They also found several guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition along with a ballistics helmet and vest. Morrow also had white supremacist materials but police say they’re still investigating what role that played in Morrow’s apartment full of deadly devices. “It does cause me some concern but I want to make very clear just because Mr. Morrow was in the possession of this material, does not categorize in any particular light. He could have been an individual that was doing research,” said Lt. Terrence Gebhardt, Beaver Dam Lieutenant of Detectives. The FBI is reviewing those white supremacy documents. A spokesman for the FBI said they cannot comment on open investigations. Beaver Dam residents say it is scary learning what was inside Morrow’s apartment. Residents and police say they never thought something like this would happen in Beaver Dam. Detectives say the materials found in the apartment are relatively easy to get and it’s disturbing how easy it can be to make explosives. Officials also found instructions on how to make the bombs as well. “We would not expect anything like this in the city of Beaver Dam. In my 25-year career, I’ve never encountered anything of this magnitude. It causes concern and pause and reflecting on my career,” said Gebhardt. Police say they are still following all leads and are still encouraging the public to come through with any information. See the list of what officials found inside the apartment below: Following the explosion, the apartment complex and neighboring buildings were evacuated.

Article: Relation between the United States and Columbia suffered for many years because of an incident involving the Republic of Panama. By the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, many Americans felt that an easier and faster way was needed to get ships from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Some people in the United States first believed that a canal across Nicaragua was the answer. However, President Theodore Roosevelt decided that a canal through Panama would be a better choice. In order to build the canal , the United States had to negotiate a treaty with Columbia , which at that time controlled Panama . Roosevelt offered Columbia 10 million plus 250,000 a year for 99 years for a six-mile-wide strip of land across Panama. Columbia rejected the United States' offer. This ranged President Roosevelt, and negotiations with Columbia ended. In 1903, a revolution broke out in Panama. The United States ships were sent by President Roosevelt to protect the Panamanian revolutionaries from Columbian forces. The revolution succeeded, and Panama declared its independence from Columbia. The United States then negotiated with the newly formed government. A treaty was signed, and the United States began building the canal. As a result of the incident, Columbia and the United States remained on bad terms for many years. Not until 1921, when the United States agreed to pay Columbia some compensation for its territory, did relations between the two countries improve.

The business of high frequency trading -- using algorithms and superfast computers to conduct trades in a fraction of a second -- is a supercharged version of this, with the potential to execute millions of buy and sell orders electronically each day through the myriad exchanges currently in existence. Advocates argue that high frequency trading reduces market volatility and lowers transaction costs for small investors, but others claim it is unfair on slower traders, and can lead to instability -- trading algorithms and high frequency trading were behind the \\"Flash Crash\\" of May 6 2010, when the Dow Jones briefly plummeted almost 1,000 points. Irrespective of how the popularity of high frequency trading changes in the future, this need for speed will continue to drive a technological arms race where the weapons of choice include new types of computer circuits hard-wired with dedicated trading algorithms; new tunnels blasted through mountains to ensure more direct optic fiber connections; new cables being laid in straighter paths across the Atlantic seabed; and even new networks of microwave towers to profit from the speed of electromagnetic signals through air. And as the search for an evolutionary edge continues, \\"genetic\\" trading programs will be created that develop specific mutant offspring in response to real-time changes in market conditions. Even long-term pension funds play the high frequency game, hence it involves us all -- whether we like it or not. There is one factor that limits speed: According to Einstein, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. However this leaves ample opportunity for future increases in trading speed. Light can travel approximately one foot in a nanosecond (a billionth of a second) in free space, meaning that current processers, routers and switching devices have plenty of room for improvement. And just as faster predators in the animal kingdom catch more prey and will be less vulnerable to other predators, faster trading companies will emerge at the expense of slower ones. In parallel, a new form of ultrafast options market may emerge with second-scale contract times in order to hedge high frequency risk. However, there are two problems that make the future of high frequency trading of unique global concern, irrespective of how popular it becomes. The first is a scientific one: Financial markets represent the largest-ever sociotechnical system in existence, with a mix of state-of-the-art communications and computational power operating at speeds approaching the natural speed limit of light. Yet nobody, including Einstein, has ever produced a theory that predicts what might go wrong in an ultrafast global network of interconnected machines that carry out millions of operations in the blink of an eye -- or what can be done to prevent or manage it. This leads to the second problem. How can regulators and governments possibly decide how to manage this emerging ultrafast financial jungle if nobody yet fully understands it? My fellow researchers and I recently uncovered glimpses of what is already going wrong in the form of escalating patterns of \\"sub-second tsunamis.\\" These tsunamis are huge spikes and dips in the price of an individual stock. Although the Flash Crash was fast, lasting only a few minutes, these sub-second tsunamis are over in the blink of an eye -- and there are thousands of them. A 10% daily change in a major stock would guarantee breaking news coverage, but these tsunamis typically send the price plummeting to almost zero. However they go unnoticed since the price quickly recovers as other algorithms jump in for the kill. Their existence reveals a remarkable difference between the human trading world above the typical human response time of one second, and the all-machine ecology of trading algorithms below one second. Just like cracks propagating in a structure prior to mechanical failure, these sub-second tsunamis escalated in the lead up to the 2008 financial meltdown. Most importantly, the stock showing highest proliferation are the banks that are now associated with the crisis. Yet nobody knew at the time. Indeed our research predicts a growing zoo of such tsunamis in the future, with each species having its own characteristic twist and turns. Governments need the financial equivalent of an air traffic control system in order to know how to manage this brave new world, and hence what rules (if any) to impose. This in turn will require a joint research program between trading houses, regulators and academics. However, instead of using conventional economics, the methodological approach should be built around complex adaptive systems and dynamical networks. Generative market models must be tested in real-time against high resolution data, to see if they can reproduce the observed price exchange dynamics down to the sub-second scale. Our own research predicts that these sub-second market movements will be neither completely unpredictable nor predictable, but will instead have pockets of predictability that come and go in particular ways. Estimates of the market share of different trading algorithms will enable real-time system management, while ensuring that the secrecy of individual trading entities remains intact. Without such a financial Manhattan Project, regulatory bodies will effectively be flying blind and may end up doing more harm than good. Read this: How to start your own currency.

A group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The soldiers name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth Pena) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return.Edy then travels to his store, a small neighbourhood supermarket. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies.Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friends Johnny (Luis Gusman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Timmy (I think that was his name, he never shows up in the film) was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of softball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Hector (Alexander Bautista), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Hector, and Hector stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Hector, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back the they make their way to Edy's store.Upon arrival at Edy's store, Jesse gets a warm welcome from the staff and neighbours being something of a war hero to those around him. Edy, Jesse, Johnny and Ozzy head back home to celebrate Christmas.

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012.

Background: Women in Syria constitute 49.4% of Syria's population, and are active participants not only in everyday life, but also in the socio-political fields. Notable examples are president Assad's chief political and media adviser, Bouthaina Shaaban, who also held office as Minister of Expatriates from 2002 and 2008, and Hadiya Khalaf Abbas, the officially elected speaker of the People's Council of Syria and the first woman to have held that position. Whatsoever, the Syrian Civil War put a new obstacle on Syrian women, forcing them to face increasing levels of violence, including war rape, and traditional abusive practices such as honor killings which occur in rural areas and areas held by extremist terrorists. Context: With the Syrian Civil War, the Kurdish populated area in Northern Syria has gained de facto autonomy as the Federation of Northern Syria - Rojava, with the leading political actor being the progressive Democratic Union Party (PYD). Kurdish women have several armed and non-armed organizations in Rojava, and enhancing women's rights is a major focus of the political and societal agenda. Kurdish female fighters in the Women's Protection Units (YPJ) played a key role during the Siege of Kobani and in rescuing Yazidis trapped on Mount Sinjar, and their achievements have attracted international attention as a rare example of strong female achievement in a region in which women are heavily repressed. The civil laws of Syria are valid in Rojava, as far as they do not conflict with the Constitution of Rojava. One notable example for amendment is personal status law, in Syria still Sharia-based, where Rojava introduced civil law and proclaims absolute equality of women under the law and a ban on forced marriage as well as polygamy was introduced, while underage marriage was outlawed as well. For the first time in Syrian history, civil marriage is being allowed and promoted, a significant move towards a secular open society and intermarriage between people of different religious backgrounds. The legal efforts to reduce cases of underage marriage, polygamy and honor killings are underpinned by comprehensive public awareness campaigns. In every town and village, a women's house is established. These are community centers run by women, providing services to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and other forms of harm. These services include counseling, family mediation, legal support, and coordinating safe houses for women and children. Classes on economic independence and social empowerment programs are also held at women's houses. All administrative organs in Rojava are required to have male and female co-chairs, and forty percent of the members of any governing body in Rojava must be female. An estimated 25 percent of the Asayish police force of the Rojava cantons are women, and joining the Asayish is described in international media as a huge act of personal and societal liberation from an extremely patriarchical background, for ethnic Kurdish and ethnic Arab women alike. The PYD's political agenda of \\"trying to break the honor-based religious and tribal rules that confine women\\" is controversial in conservative quarters of society. Question: What is the federation of Norther Syria? Answer:","completion":"Okay, imagine you and your friends decide to create a special group, where everyone has equal say, gets to play their favorite games, and takes care of each other. The Federation of Northern Syria, also known as Rojava, is kind of like that special group. It's a part of Syria where people have decided to run things in their own way, giving everyone equal rights and making sure even women have important roles in decision-making. It's like a smaller group within the larger country of Syria. They have their own rules and ways of doing things, making sure everyone is treated fairly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Cairo for the following movie plot: The film opens up on April 24, 1980 during Operation Eagle Claw, the American operation to rescue American hostages being held at the U.S. embassy to Tehran. The operation is being aborted after a fatal helicopter crash in the Iranian desert, with the U.S. Delta Force evacuating to their C-130 transports. Among them is Captain Scott McCoy (Chuck Norris), who, against orders, rescues his wounded comrade Pete Peterson (William Wallace) from the burning helicopter before the team finally evacuates. McCoy expresses his disgust for President Carter as well as the politicians and military hierarchy that forced the mission to launch despite the risks, and announces he is resigning his commission.Five years later, a group of Lebanese terrorists armed with a Colt M1911, PM-63 machine pistol and AK-47s hijack American Travelways Boeing 707 (ATW) Flight 282 that is on a flight from Cairo to Athens to Rome and to New York City. Taking all 144 passengers and crew hostage, the group, an Iranian pro-Khomeini New World Revolutionary Organization, led by Abdul Rafai (Robert Forster) and Mustafa (David Menachem), forces Captain Roger Campbell (Bo Svenson) and his crew to fly the plane to Beirut, Lebanon, where they make demands to the United States government that, if not met, will result in the death of the hostages. During the crisis, they separate the Jewish passengers from the Americans by forcing the flight attendant to identify them, who is hesitant to do so because she is German. Unbeknownst to the Lebanese authorities, the Jewish hostages are then taken off the plane and transported to a militant-controlled area of Beirut, while a dozen additional henchmen are brought on board. The plane departs for Algiers, where the terrorists release the female hostages and children.Meanwhile, the Delta Force, led by the veteran Colonel Nick Alexander (Lee Marvin) and McCoy, recalled to active duty.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. and the situation: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands. Answer the following question: Which parcel of land had soil with faster rates of decomposition? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background and situation, the parcel of land with faster rates of decomposition would be Bill's grassland. Step 1: Understand the background information - Soil in the forest has thick humus layers and slow rates of decomposition. - Forests have excess water that percolates downward through soil layers, leaching minerals like Mg, Fe, and Al. - The process of podzolization leads to contrasting soil layers in the forest. Step 2: Compare the given land types - Tom's land is forested. - Bill's land is covered with grasslands. Step 3: Consider decomposition rates - Forests have slow rates of decomposition, leaving large amounts of fulvic acid and favorable conditions for chemical weathering. - In contrast, grasslands generally have faster rates of decomposition due to factors like increased aeration, less moisture, and less acidic conditions. Therefore, we can conclude that Bill's grassland has soil with faster rates of decomposition when compared to Tom's forested land."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what not to say to eating disorder I found the following answer on Google: Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are the most common specific forms in the United Kingdom. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"No, the information provided from Google does not directly answer the question about what not to say to someone with an eating disorder. However, it does provide basic facts about the prevalence of specific forms of eating disorders in the United Kingdom. To answer the original question, it is crucial to be aware of how our words can impact individuals struggling with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Here is a list of things you should avoid saying to someone with an eating disorder: 1. Comments on appearance: Do not make remarks about their weight, shape, or size, as these comments may reinforce negative thoughts and feelings that underlie the eating disorder. 2. Mentioning or discussing diets: Do not bring up topics about calorie counting, weight loss plans, or the benefits of certain diets, as this may trigger unwanted behaviors or perpetuate the eating disorder. 3. Using derogatory names or phrases: Refrain from using offensive names or phrases that target their eating disorder, such as calling them \\"anorexic\\" or \\"bulimic.\\" Use empathetic language and inquire about their feelings instead. 4. Encouraging comparisons: Avoid comparing their body or eating habits with others, as it may contribute to low self-esteem or feelings of inadequacy. 5. Focusing on food: Keep in mind that eating disorders are complex psychological illnesses. Do not solely focus on their eating habits, food choices, or the amount they consume. Encourage a broader conversation about their general well-being and emotions. 6. Offering simplistic solutions: Avoid saying phrases like \\"just eat\\" or \\"stop throwing up.\\" Eating disorders are not easy to overcome and making these remarks might belittle their struggles. 7. Being overly critical or judgmental: Be supportive and understanding, rather than criticizing or judging their behaviors. Create an open and accepting environment for them to share their thoughts and feelings. 8. Demanding or guilting them into eating: Forcing them to eat or making them feel guilty for not eating will likely have a negative impact on their mental health and progress toward recovery. 9. Discussing your own weight or appearance-related insecurities: Sharing your own insecurities may inadvertenly impact their body image or make it more challenging for them to discuss their struggles openly. It's essential to create a supportive and empathetic environment for people with eating disorders, allowing them to express their thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment. Encourage them to seek professional help from therapists, counselors, or other healthcare professionals experienced in treating eating disorders. Remember, the road to recovery can be challenging, and it's crucial to provide steadfast care and understanding for your friend or loved one."},{"prompt":"Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth A:","completion":"The final step of this process is the affected rain falling to the earth, potentially impacting the environment, soil, plants, and water sources.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Methyl groups are found within amino acids. Choices: - rna acids - DNA molecules - peptide chains - amino acids A: Answer:","completion":"Methyl groups are found within amino acids. A methyl group, which consists of one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms (CH3), is a type of alkyl functional group found in many different molecules, including those that make up living organisms. In the context of biology and organic chemistry, these groups are often found in larger organic molecules, where they can have a significant impact on the molecule’s properties and reactivity. In the specific context of your question, the paragraph mentions that methyl groups are found within amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they play many other key roles in organisms. There are 20 standard amino acids that make up the proteins in the human body, each of which has a unique side chain. Some of these side chains contain methyl groups. One clear example of an amino acid with a methyl group is alanine. The side chain of alanine has a single carbon atom, which is attached to three hydrogen atoms, forming a methyl group. This is a key part of the structure of alanine, making it one of the simplest amino acids in terms of its structure. Another example is methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid. Its side chain contains a sulfur atom bonded to a carbon atom, which in turn is attached to three hydrogen atoms, forming a methyl group. Therefore, your question has provided the information that methyl groups are found within the structure of certain amino acids.

Because paperbag waist pants tend to be baggier and add more volume to your figure, it’s best to wear them with a fitted top. That will help balance the proportions in your outfit for the most flattering look. For a casual look, a fitted tee shirt or tank top work best with your paperbag waist pants. For a dressed up look, wear the pants with a fitted button-down blouse for an office-appropriate outfit. A fitted sweater can work for a casual or an office look depending on the style of the pants. Even if your top is fitted, it can have an unflattering look if it sits over the paperbag waist of your pants. That’s why it’s best to tuck your top into the pants so the waist detail is highlighted and you don’t add any more bulk to your midsection. If you aren’t a fan of tucking in tops, consider pairing the paperbag waist pants with a bodysuit that naturally rests beneath the waistline. Cropped tops are another option when you’re wearing paperbag waist pants. Because they typically end above the waistline, they allow you to show off the paperbag waist and don’t add any bulk to the area. You can opt for a looser fitting top if you’re wearing a cropped style because the extra fabric won’t compete with the pants’ waistband given the higher hemline. You can wear jackets, cardigans, and blazers with paperbag waist pants, but choose slim styles that won’t add too much bulk to your look. Avoid boyfriend style blazers or cardigans, which are too loose to work with the pants. Consider the length of the your layering pieces too. It’s best to choose either a cropped style or a longer piece that hits at mid-thigh, so it doesn’t hit right at the waist where it will compete with the pants’ waistband.","completion":"To achieve a flattering look with paperbag waist pants, pair them with fitted tops tucked in or cropped styles and slim, carefully chosen layering pieces to avoid adding excess bulk to the waist area."},{"prompt":"Instructions: You will be given a context and a question in Spanish.

Input: CONTEXT: El premio Nobel de Economía de 1999, Robert Mundell pidió hoy que el Banco Central Europeo (BCE) apoye el euro más que ahora para evitar que suba demasiado cuando se confirme la ralentización del crecimiento estadounidense y se invierta la tendencia. Mundell, que pronunció un discurso en la Conferencia del Banco Mundial sobre la globalización y el desarrollo, advirtió que \\"llegará un momento en que el BCE querrá evitar (que el euro) suba demasiado\\", y para tratar de impedirlo y luchar contra la depreciación de la moneda única, tendría que actuar ahora. Recordó que \\"hoy Estados Unidos es de lejos el primer deudor del mundo y tiene un déficit por cuenta corriente de 350.000 millones de dólares o incluso más\\", y que una ralentización de su economía dificultará la financiación de ese déficit. Ante esta debilidad económica, el Tesoro estadounidense querrá favorecer la devaluación de su moneda, con lo que \\"el dólar empezará entonces a retroceder (...) y el euro podría ser propulsado\\", lo que afectaría a la competitividad de los 11 países de la zona euro, explicó. Mundell insistió en que si los europeos no impiden desde ahora un nivel excesivamente alto del dólar frente al euro, perderán margen de maniobra cuando cambie la tendencia. En términos de política económica, no apoyar el euro \\"sería un error de la parte del BCE, que es tan pequeño y tan poco poderoso comparado con el Tesoro estadounidense\\", añadió.

Input: Review: Director/star Clint Eastwood's \\"Sudden Impact\\" is an intriguing addition to the \\"Dirty Harry\\" series - a combination of crude film-making and genius. It's mediocre and silly in parts, brilliant and classic in others, with compelling, gripping pacing. There are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up \\"Make my day\\" scene recalls the \\"Do you feel lucky\\" one, one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's Scorpio, an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as Harry's partner - just to name a few.Harry Callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department, still mean, still tough, but now he's older and wearier. His constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice, the two things not always being compatible. This \\"incompatibility\\" is the underlying theme of the series. The first film posed a simple question, \\"What about the victim's rights?\\" - (do they outweigh those of the criminal? Vice versa? Depends?). That film's answer was controversial, prompting a sequel (the highly enjoyable \\"Magnum Force\\") which set out to draw the line between Harry's brand of justice and pure, heartless vigilantism. Dirty Harry, like many of Clint's other roles, is the personification of vengeance, the protector of the the defenseless. This movie however brings it back to the victim, in this case Jennifer (portrayed by Sondra Locke), who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men (and one woman) who committed the crime.Without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie, I will say this - I mentioned earlier that \\"Sudden Impact\\" echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series (the confusion concerning the captain's last name is an example - an intentional prank, I believe). The relationship between Callahan and Jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante? And is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights? The exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series, one which I personally (as a fan) found quite moving. That last scene alone makes Sudden Impact the legitimate climax to the \\"Dirty Harry\\" collection, the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film. (Not to knock \\"The Dead Pool\\" - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring Harry Callahan, rather than a character-defining film like this one).This movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the Reagan Era found Harry and his ilk quite appealing, and the President himself frequently quoted \\"Go ahead, make my day.\\" Question: is it a negative review?

However, an old fox was also looking for something to eat. He noticed the crow and, most notably, the piece of meat she held. Instantly, he concocted a plan to get that meat from the crow. The fox starts to praise the crow, complimenting her babies, her looks, and even her voice.

As she opens her mouth to sing, she drops the meat, which the fox catches with his mouth. In this way, the fox skillfully manipulates the crow into giving up her meat, turning it into his own breakfast. So, the answer to the question is yes, the \\"old fox\\" does have a nice breakfast. He successfully eats the piece of meat, which had initially been the crow's. The old fox's cunning strategy to trick the crow into losing her hold on the meat ensures that he enjoys what was meant to be a nice breakfast for the crow's babies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given this review: \\"Not able to send messages always gets an error if socket session time out\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","completion":"Based on the review provided, I would recommend answering \\"Maybe\\" when considering whether to recommend this app to a friend. There are a few factors that contribute to this suggestion: 1. The reviewer reports a significant issue – they encounter an error when trying to send messages due to a socket session timeout. This implies that the core functionality of the app, which is presumably messaging, is being hindered for the user. Such an issue can be quite frustrating for users who heavily rely on messaging apps for communication with friends, family, and colleagues. Recommending an app that seems to have difficulties fulfilling its intended purpose might not be in the best interest of your friend. 2. However, the review itself is relatively brief and does not provide much context regarding the frequency of the problem, the device used, or whether the user reached out to the app's support team for assistance. It's possible that the issue could be isolated to the reviewer's unique circumstances or a specific device incompatibility. In that case, your friend might not necessarily experience the same difficulties while using the app. 3. Another thing to consider is the app's overall popularity and other user reviews. This single review may not paint the full picture of the app's performance, reliability, or general user satisfaction. If the app has a significant number of positive reviews and high ratings from other users, it could be worth recommending despite the flaw mentioned in this specific review. To summarize, I recommend responding \\"Maybe\\" based on the information provided in the review. The reported issue with sending messages is problematic, but there isn't enough context to determine whether this problem is isolated or widespread among users. It would be helpful to gather additional information – such as other user reviews, the app's support responsiveness, and overall popularity – before making a final recommendation to your friend."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Article: I'm Ann.

Question: Does Gerard persue d'Artagnan? Title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

Translate this to English?","completion":"The other issues I would like to address are the confusion between economic migration and asylum seeking, and between economic migration and asylum seeking, on one hand, and illegal immigration on the other hand - these are distinct, separate topics that need to be approached differently. In recent years, global migration has been increasingly discussed in various forums, addressing the complex dynamics and implications it has on society. This has led to confusion in distinguishing between different types of migration, such as economic migration, asylum seeking, and illegal immigration. It is important to understand and address these distinct categories separately to devise appropriate policies and measures. Economic migration refers to people who move from their home country to another country with the primary motive of seeking better employment opportunities and improved living conditions. This type of migration is generally driven by economic disparities between countries, with individuals aiming to achieve better quality of life for themselves and their families. Economic migrants usually follow legal immigration channels, obtaining visas and work permits for their destination countries. Asylum seeking, on the other hand, pertains to individuals who flee their home country due to fear of persecution or serious harm based on factors such as race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Asylum seekers seek refuge in other nations by submitting applications, typically in accordance with the 1951 Refugee Convention, which outlines the rights of displaced persons and the responsibilities of nations in providing protection. Illegal immigration refers to the movement of people across national borders in violation of immigration laws and regulations. This may include those who do not have the necessary documentation to enter or remain in the destination country, or those who have overstayed their visas. Illegal immigration poses different challenges as it relates to border security, social integration, and potential exploitation of individuals without legal status. These three categories - economic migration, asylum seeking, and illegal immigration - each come with their own set of complexities and implications. Addressing them separately allows for better understanding and management of the unique challenges each group faces, including humanitarian concerns, economic integration, and law enforcement issues. In conclusion, the confusion between economic migration and asylum seeking, and between economic migration and asylum seeking on one hand and illegal immigration on the other hand, must be addressed by acknowledging the distinct characteristics and objectives behind each type of migration. By approaching these topics individually and understanding their nuances, it becomes easier to develop effective policies and strategies that can address the various challenges and opportunities presented by migration."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who was described as being very tense at rehearsals? ? In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia. Australia's Great Barrier Reef is at risk because authorities are failing to protect the marine park by approving the dumping of dredge spoil, a former government official says. Jon Day, who was a former director of Conservation Biodiversity and World Heritage at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, says the dumping of dredge spoil will put more pressure on a reef that is already in decline. The authority approved plans in January to dump three million cubic metres of dredge spoil at the Great Barrier Reef to expand Queensland's Abbot Point coal port. Scroll down for video. Australia's Great Barrier Reef is at risk because authorities are failing to protect the marine park by approving the dumping of dredge spoil from Abbot Point coal port, a former government official says. It's a decision that should not have been made, according to Mr Day, and is part of an ABC Four Corners investigation on Monday. Scientists and senior officials within the authority faced a tense year-long struggle against the proposal, with fears about the effect the spoil could have on the marine park. 'The big question is why was it allowed to be approved,' Four Corners reporter Marian Wilkinson told Daily Mail Australia. 'The official view from the Environment Minister (Greg Hunt) is that they've put tougher environmental conditions on so they believe it can be done safely. But there's a lot of questions among experts inside and outside the agency about it.' Jon Day, who was a former director of Conservation Biodiversity and World Heritage at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told ABC reporter Marian Wilkinson the dumping of dredge spoil would put more pressure on a reef that is already in decline. Mr Day, who resigned from the authority last month, says alternatives to sea dumping for Abbot Point weren't properly considered. 'If we take that into account and if we did a proper evaluation of all the alternatives, that decision would not have been made,' he said. 'Our own legislative mandate says \\"the long-term protection and conservation of the values\\", and we're not doing that.' Wilkinson said the decision was criticised by UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, which will decide next year whether the reef should be declared 'in danger'. The authority approved plans in January to dump three million cubic metres of dredge spoil at the Great Barrier Reef to expand Queensland's Abbot Point coal port. Reporter Marian Wilkinson Wilkinson said the decision was criticised by UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, which will decide next year whether the reef should be declared 'in danger' 'The other options to look at were trying to find a place to dump on land and trying to do something to extend the port's trestles so that ships didn't have to come so close to the reef,' Wilkinson said. Mr Hunt, the federal environment minister who approved the dumping, told the program that Abbot Point was a 'line in the sand' and he has guaranteed that no further dumping will take place in the marine park under his watch. 'Of course, the argument from some of the scientists is why did we have to have this one in the first place?' Wilkinson said. The ABC's Four Corners is on Monday night at 8.30pm. Scientists and senior officials within the authority faced a tense year-long struggle against the proposal, with fears about the effect the spoil could have on the marine park. Highlights:","completion":"1. Australia's Great Barrier Reef might be in danger because people in charge aren't protecting it. 2.

Possible answers: (i). loved by Addison (ii). wants his friends to follow there dreams (iii). hated by Addison Answer:","completion":"Cameron would most likely feel loved and supported by Addison as a result of Addison's decision to support Cameron's family decisions. This response stems from the fact that family decisions typically involve significant life choices and have a considerable impact on an individual's overall well-being and happiness. For Addison to carefully analyze the situation and ultimately decide to support Cameron's choices, it demonstrates genuine care, understanding, and respect for Cameron's autonomy in making those decisions. When receiving such support from a friend, it can strengthen the bond between the two individuals and build a more substantial, more profound connection. Trust, appreciation, and loyalty may also increase between them, laying the foundation for a lasting friendship. Cameron might feel more encouraged, motivated, and secure in their decisions because of Addison's support. It can alleviate some of the stress or uncertainty associated with those choices. Moreover, Cameron might perceive Addison as a reliable and trustworthy companion on whom they can confide during challenging times.

The calculator helps you navigate through this data with ease. Simply enter the name of your club and you'll have all the key data presented and put into context for you. In addition you can work out how much support of your team is costing you. Simply enter your ticket cost, food, drink and programme spend, plus how many replica shirts you buy and the amount you pay on TV sports subscriptions. The calculator will then compare that to a number of costs, such as player wages, transfer fees and other leisure pursuits. Throughout the calculator, we compare how various costs have changed using data from previous BBC Price of Football studies. Some data comparisons are not available for clubs not included in previous years. The 'price of a goal' is calculated by dividing the cost of a club's cheapest season ticket last season by the number of goals scored by the team at home in the same season. Some comparisons are not available for clubs not surveyed last season, or promoted to the National League. Programme costs were not collected from European clubs, as many do not publish match-day programmes in the same way as UK teams. The BBC contacted 227 clubs for the study. Of those, 200 were in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales and another 27 in Europe. The data was collated and verified by BBC Sport journalists. Swansea are omitted from the survey and calculator because they declined to take part. All ticket prices refer to an adult ticket when bought individually. The match-day ticket prices quoted refer to high and low prices available on the day of a game, to reflect the price for fans who decide on match day they would like to attend a game, and not individual offers. Match-day costs reflect categories that are registered with the relevant league, rather than individual, or one-off, offers. The season ticket prices quoted refer to the cheapest possible ticket (including early bird offers), and the most expensive season ticket.

What is the reason I would have to move sand all day ?","completion":"In the given text, the reason you would have to move sand all day is due to the nature of your new job in the city landscaping. Landscaping is a profession that involves designing, creating, and maintaining outdoor spaces using various elements such as plants, stones, and sand, to enhance the aesthetics, functionality, and overall quality of the environment. In this particular context, moving sand all day is an essential component of your landscaping duties. Sand, a versatile and accessible material, serves multiple purposes when working with landscaping projects. Here are several reasons why moving sand all day could be necessary in this landscaping job: 1. Site preparation: Before the actual landscaping work can begin, the site typically requires proper preparation. This can involve leveling the ground, filling uneven areas, or creating specific contours. Moving sand all day could be aimed at adequately preparing the site for the installation of plants, walkways, or other landscape features. 2. Drainage improvement: Sand plays a crucial role in improving the drainage of soils, especially in areas where the existing soil structure may not allow for proper drainage. In this case, moving sand all day could involve mixing or layering sand into the soil to enhance the water drainage and ensure the health and longevity of the plants in the landscaped area. 3. Base material for pavers and pathways: Landscape designs often include pathways, patios, and other paved areas that need a stable and level base to ensure proper installation and longevity. Sand can be used as a supportive and flexible base material that allows for a firm surface for pavers or stones. Therefore, moving sand all day might involve creating solid foundations for these hardscape elements. 4. Stability and support for plants: Some landscape designs incorporate sand as a growing medium for certain plant species, particularly those that prefer well-draining soil conditions, such as succulents, desert plants, or native species that thrive in sandy environments. You may be moving sand all day to arrange specific plant beds that cater to these plants' needs. 5. Decorative purposes: In many landscaping projects, sand can serve as an aesthetic element to enhance the overall design. It can be used as a visual contrast with other materials, create artificial beach areas, or even be utilized for sand sculpting and other artistic creations. As part of the landscaping job, moving sand all day might involve designing and constructing these decorative features. In conclusion, moving sand all day in a city landscaping job stems from the many roles sand can play in such projects. Whether it is to prepare the site, address drainage concerns, provide stability and support for plants, or serve for decorative purposes, sand is a valuable resource that aids in creating and maintaining beautiful and functional outdoor spaces."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How to call the first emperor in Han Dynasty? Context: China's first imperial dynasty was the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang.

Answer: A steam locomotive in Germany .This class of engine was built in 1942 – 1950 and operated commercially until 1988. Question: how does a steam engine work The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the given statement about a steam locomotive in Germany is not the correct answer to the question, \\"How does a steam engine work?\\" Instead, here is a detailed explanation of how a steam engine works: A steam engine works by transforming heat energy into mechanical energy using steam as the working fluid. This process is based on the principle of energy conversion, where heat energy is used to produce mechanical work through the expansion of steam. The steam engine has been instrumental in powering various developments in industries such as transport, power generation, and manufacturing. Here is an in-depth explanation: 1. Components of a steam engine: To understand how a steam engine functions, it's essential to discuss its key components, which typically include a boiler, piston, cylinder, condenser, and steam valve. 2. Boiler: It is a closed vessel or container where water is heated to create steam. The boiler is equipped with a heating source, such as coal, wood, or oil, which heats the water, causing it to produce steam. The steam is then channeled into the steam engine's cylinder. 3. Cylinder: This is a closed chamber in which the steam is introduced and converted into mechanical energy. The cylinder houses a piston that moves back and forth due to the pressure exerted by the steam. 4. Piston: The piston is a sliding component that moves back and forth inside the cylinder. Its motion is directly affected by the pressure exerted by the steam. The piston is connected to a connecting rod, which is then linked to the main driving wheel or shaft. 5. Condenser: The condenser is responsible for cooling the steam back into water so that it can be reused in the system. This is an essential component in making the steam engine more efficient, as it reduces the amount of water and fuel required and minimizes heat loss. 6. Steam valve: The steam valve regulates the flow of steam into and out of the cylinder. It ensures that the steam enters the cylinder at the right time and pressure to move the piston accordingly. Now that we've outlined the key components of a steam engine, here's a step-by-step explanation of how it operates: 1. Water in the boiler is heated using an external heat source, such as coal, oil, or wood, which raises its temperature and pressure until it turns into steam. 2. The steam is then directed into the steam engine's cylinder through a steam valve. 3. Inside the cylinder, the steam's pressure and force push the piston, making it move back and forth. This movement is transferred through a connecting rod to the driving wheel or shaft, creating mechanical energy and motion. 4. Once the steam has expanded and completed its work in the cylinder, it is released through an exhaust valve to the condenser. 5. The condenser cools the steam back into water, which is then returned to the boiler to be used again in the process. This cycle continues, making the steam engine function continuously. 6. The steam engine's mechanical energy is harnessed to power various machines, such as locomotives, ships, and various manufacturing equipment. In conclusion, a steam engine works by converting heat energy into mechanical energy through the use of steam. The entire process involves heating water in a boiler, expanding steam in a cylinder to move a piston, and then utilizing the generated mechanical energy to perform work. The given answer, which mentioned a specific steam locomotive class in Germany, does not accurately address how a steam engine works."},{"prompt":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the label that came after Zappa discontinued his old one in 1973? ? Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included Ian Underwood (reeds, keyboards), Ruth Underwood (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), Napoleon Murphy Brock (sax, flute and vocals), Bruce Fowler (trombone), Tom Fowler (bass), Chester Thompson (drums), Ralph Humphrey (drums), George Duke (keyboards, vocals), and Jean-Luc Ponty (violin). By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also distributed by Warner Bros. Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No. 10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the No. 86 chart hit \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as \\"Dinah-Moe Humm\\" and \\"Montana\\", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as \\"Inca Roads\\", \\"Echidna's Arf (Of You)\\" and \\"Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)\\".

This perception is formed due to the combination of various elements present within the statement, which can be broken down for a clearer understanding. Firstly, the juxtaposition of two contrasting ideas helps emphasize the negative sentiment. The initial part of the sentence \\"feels less the product of loving, well-integrated homage\\" introduces the notion of something that could have been perceived as a positive, respectful tribute. The words \\"loving\\" and \\"well-integrated\\" imply feelings of warmth, affectionate care, and seamless blending into the context. However, the sentence takes a negative turn with the words \\"more like a mere excuse,\\" which downplays the quality or value of the subject being discussed. This further diminishes the subject by drawing attention away from its potentially positive qualities and instead focuses on its weaker aspects. The term \\"mere excuse\\" indicates a bare, inadequate effort put into the creation or execution. Additionally, the phrase \\"for the wan, thinly sketched story\\" strengthens the negative sentiment by utilizing words with unfavorable connotations. \\"Wan\\" is often used to describe something that is weak, pale, or lacking in vitality and enthusiasm. Likewise, \\"thinly sketched\\" suggests a lack of depth, detail, or substance, hinting that the story might not have been thought through or well-crafted. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence is predominantly negative as it emphasizes the subject's shortcomings, rather than its positive qualities. The tone suggests disappointment, possibly hinting that the audience's expectations were not met, and the outcome was not what could have been achieved with a more thoughtful and thorough approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Possible answers: (i). Eat more spicy foods, it tricks you into feeling fuller.; (ii). Eat more sweet foods, it tricks you into feeling fuller.;","completion":"Option (i): Eat more spicy foods, it tricks you into feeling fuller. Losing weight more easily can be achieved by adopting healthier eating habits, and incorporating spicy foods into your diet can be an effective approach. Spicy foods, especially those containing capsaicin (found in chili peppers), historically have been thought to aid in weight loss by increasing metabolic rate, reducing appetite, and promoting a sense of fullness. Here's how you can incorporate spicy foods into your routine to help lose weight more easily: 1. Gradually adding peppers: Begin by gradually adding spicy peppers like jalapeños, serranos, or habaneros to your meals. Start with a few slices and increase the spice level as you become more accustomed to the heat. 2. Experiment with spices: Use a variety of spices and herbs known to add heat and flavor to your dishes. This can include cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, turmeric, curry powder, and ginger. Experiment with different combinations to keep things interesting and appealing to your taste buds. 3. Incorporate spicy condiments: Add spicy condiments, such as hot sauce, salsa, or spicy mustard, to your meals. These can be easily added to salads, sandwiches, or stir-fries without significantly altering the main ingredients of the dish. 4. Cook with spicy oil: Cook your food in spicy oils such as chili or garlic-infused oil. This will add extra heat to your meals while also providing a delicious flavor. 5. Try spicy snacks: Choose healthier spicy snacks, like roasted chickpeas, spiced popcorn, or spicy vegetable sticks. 6. Increase fiber intake: Coupling your spicy foods with high-fiber options will help you achieve a greater sense of fullness, also contributing to weight loss. High-fiber foods can include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts. 7. Practice mindful eating: Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues while consuming spicy foods. Slowing down your eating allows your body the time to recognize when it’s full and prevent overeating. 8. Balanced diet: Remember that the key to weight loss is a well-balanced diet. Make sure you are including a variety of foods and not relying solely on spicy options. Consuming a range of macronutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, is fundamental to reaching weight loss goals and maintaining a healthy weight in the long run. While spicy foods can help in promoting a feeling of fullness and may contribute to weight loss, it's important to remember that overall dietary habits, portion control, and regular physical activity are essential to effectively lose weight in a safe and sustainable manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would I take the application lock on iphone?","completion":"No, the two questions are not precisely the same, although they are related. They both ask about taking the application lock on an iPhone, but the focus and the wording differ slightly. Let's break down the differences and the implications of each question. 1. \\"By what framework may I take the application lock on iPhone?\\" This question focuses on the framework or approach that one needs to take in order to implement an application lock on an iPhone. It seeks to get detailed information about different methods or tools that can be used for this purpose. Answer: To enforce an application lock on your iPhone, you may use a variety of frameworks or approaches. The most common methods are: A. Use built-in screen time feature of the iPhone: The iPhone, starting from iOS 12, provides a built-in tool called Screen Time that helps manage your device usage and set App Limits for individual apps. To do this, go to Settings > Screen Time > App Limits > Add Limit, select the app, and set a time frame for usage. When the time is up, the app will be locked, and you can only access it with a passcode. This is a useful feature for setting restrictions on app usage. B. Use a third-party app locker: There are several third-party app locker applications available on the App Store that provide flexible options to lock specific apps on your iPhone. These applications generally use a combination of password, PIN, or biometric security features to protect your apps from unauthorized access. Some popular third-party app lockers for iPhone include BioProtect X, AppLocker, and Lock Apps & Folders. C. Use parental controls: Parental control features can also be used to restrict access to certain apps or functions on an iPhone. For example, to enable restrictions, go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions. Here, you can set limits on which apps can be used, the type of content allowed, as well as prevent access to certain functions. 2. \\"How would I take the application lock on iPhone?\\" This question focuses more on the step-by-step process involved in enforcing an application lock on an iPhone and assumes that the person asking the question already understands the basic concept and approach but requires instructions on implementation. Answer: To take the application lock on an iPhone, follow the steps outlined below using the built-in iOS feature, Screen Time: Step 1: Update your iPhone to the latest iOS version, if needed, to ensure you have Screen Time available. Step 2: Open the Settings app on your iPhone. Step 3:; Swipe down and tap on \\"Screen Time,\\" which is usually located just below \\"Do Not Disturb.\\" Step 4: If Screen Time is not already enabled, tap \\"Turn on Screen Time.\\" Step 5: Scroll down and tap \\"App Limits.\\" Step 6: Tap \\"Add Limit.\\" Step 7: Choose the app category or specific app(s) that you would like to set a limit for and then tap \\"Next.\\" Step 8: Set the time limit for the app(s) and tap \\"Add.\\" From now on, once the set time limit is reached, the app(s) will be locked, and you can only access them by entering the passcode.

A:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the task. The task is to predict the missing word in the given Catalan sentence. Step 2: Analyze the sentence and context. The sentence talks about entrepreneurs in comparison to other autonomous communities in Spain, claiming that they cannot access industrial land, soft loans, or support for machinery renewal, as other regional governments do. Step 3: Predict the missing word. Based on the context, the logical missing word is \\"i\\", which means \\"and\\" in English. The usage of \\"i\\" will explain that autonomous governments of Galicia, Castilla-La Mancha, and Andalusia provide support not only in one aspect but in all mentioned aspects.

Answer a question about this article: The establishment of the Santa Hermandad in 1480, and of the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia in 1500—a tribunal and executive body directed by the Governor-Captain General as a direct representative of the King—implied initially the submission of the Kingdom to the Crown, after a century of unrest and fiscal insubordination. As a result, from 1480 to 1520 the Kingdom of Galicia contributed more than 10% of the total earnings of the Crown of Castille, including the Americas, well over its economic relevance. Like the rest of Spain, the 16th century was marked by population growth up to 1580, when the simultaneous wars with the Netherlands, France and England hampered Galicia's Atlantic commerce, which consisted mostly in the exportation of sardines, wood, and some cattle and wine. In spite of these wars, which exports did Galicia's Atlantic trade consist of?","completion":"Okay, let me explain this a bit simply. Galicia is a place that had to listen to the King long ago after some problems they had before.

What is the best way to: how to keep pasta from sticking Options are: (A). Boil water with some olive oil along with your salt to keep pasta from sticking.. (B). pan fry with some olive oil along with salt to keep pasta from sticking. Answer:","completion":"The best way to keep pasta from sticking is Option A: Boil water with some olive oil along with your salt to keep pasta from sticking. Steps: 1. Fill a large pot with water: Choose a pot that has enough space for the pasta to move around as it cooks. This prevents the pasta from sticking together and allows it to cook evenly. 2. Bring water to a rolling boil: It is essential to wait until the water reaches a full, rolling boil before adding the pasta. The movement of the boiling water keeps the pasta separated as it cooks. 3. Add salt to the boiling water: Salting the water adds flavor to the pasta and helps to keep it from sticking. Use about one tablespoon of salt for every four quarts of water. 4. Add a small amount of olive oil: Adding a small amount of olive oil to the boiling water can help prevent the pasta from sticking. Use approximately one tablespoon for every four quarts of water. 5. Add the pasta and stir: Add the pasta to the boiling water and stir it gently to help separate any pieces that may be stuck together. Stir occasionally throughout the cooking process to prevent sticking. 6. Cook pasta to al dente: Follow the package instructions for the cooking time but start testing the pasta a couple of minutes before the indicated time. Cooking the pasta to al dente, which means the pasta is cooked through but still firm when bitten, will help prevent sticking. In comparison, Option B - pan-frying pasta with olive oil and salt - may not cook the pasta evenly, and it can become sticky and overcooked. Boiling pasta with olive oil and salt in water allows for even cooking and minimizes the chances of sticking together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Our English teacher often teaches us English songs, and the songs sound nice. I often think how interesting English is! Second, I think English is a foreign language. I should learn it well in the following ways: Listen to the teacher carefully, speak bravely, read aloud and have a good vocabulary. Then practice again and again, never be tired. And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever I have a question. I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand! Besides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well. And I also write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having a weak immune system can have an indirect effect on the process. A weak immune system may not be able to effectively recognize, target, and destroy the infected cells that are producing the viruses. As a result, the virus can continue to replicate and spread, making it difficult for the body to combat the infection. Also, having a weak immune system can lead to more severe illness or complications from the flu virus. However, it does not directly affect the actual process of the virus entering cells, replicating, and being released. The effect of a weak immune system on the viral production might be indirect, as it fails to efficiently control and eliminate the infected cells, allowing the virus to continue replicating and spreading."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future). and the situation: There is a local election in Troy's city and he is researching the two candidates running for mayor. Troy is a strong environmentalist who believes, above all else, that taking care of the Earth is the number one priority in anything. In his research he decides to read the environmental proposals of each candidate. Mark Hampton, one candidate, has a proposal that he says will strongly boost the city's economy by opening more industrial factories, but these will increase the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere. Jeffrey Lindell, the other candidate, says that he wants to begin implementing solar panel farms to generate electricity to cut down on the carbon emissions the city produces. Answer the following question: Which candidate is Troy less likely to vote for? Answer:","completion":"Troy is less likely to vote for Mark Hampton, based on the given background and Troy's strong environmentalist beliefs. The reasoning behind this conclusion can be broken down into the following points: 1. The current situation highlights the global issue of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, as a result of human activities since the start of the industrial revolution. This has led to a rise in average global temperatures, and the potential for even further increases as more greenhouse gases are emitted. 2. Troy is a strong environmentalist who believes that taking care of the Earth is the number one priority in anything. This indicates that his primary concern in evaluating candidates for mayor would be based on their environmental proposals and the impact of those proposals on the Earth's climate and ecosystems. 3. Mark Hampton's proposal is centered around boosting the city's economy by opening more industrial factories. While this might contribute to economic growth and job creation, it would also increase carbon dioxide emissions, thus exacerbating the already critical issue of global warming. This proposal would not align with Troy's environmental priorities and could be seen as harmful to the Earth in the long run. 4. On the other hand, Jeffrey Lindell proposes implementing solar panel farms to generate electricity, which would help cut down on the city's carbon emissions. This approach is more in line with sustainable energy practices and stands to benefit the environment by reducing the city's reliance on fossil fuels for power generation. Given Troy's strong environmentalist values, he is less likely to vote for Mark Hampton due to his proposal that prioritizes economic growth at the expense of increasing carbon dioxide emissions and potentially worsening the effects of climate change. Instead, Troy would likely lean toward supporting Jeffrey Lindell, whose proposal for solar panel farms demonstrates a commitment to sustainable energy and reducing the city's carbon footprint."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Understand the task: The task is asking you to learn how to perform a stomach crunch exercise correctly, which targets your abdominal muscles. 2. Guidelines: Here are simple steps to follow to ensure you are doing a proper stomach crunch: Step 1: Choose a comfortable surface: Find a comfortable and slightly soft surface, such as a yoga mat or a carpeted floor where you have enough space to lay down. Step 2: Lay down flat on your back: Lay down on the surface with your feet flat on the ground and your knees bent. Make sure your lower back is pressed firmly against the floor. Step 3: Position your hands: Place your hands lightly behind your head or crossed on your chest. Avoid pulling your head or neck with your hands. Step 4: Engage your core muscles: To activate your abdominal muscles, imagine pulling your belly button towards your spine. This will help prevent straining your back and neck during the crunch. Step 5: Lift your upper body: Using your core muscles, slowly lift your head, shoulders, and upper back off the ground. Do not use your hands or arms to pull yourself up and make sure your lower back remains in contact with the floor. Keep your feet flat on the ground and maintain a slow, controlled movement. Step 6: Hold the position: Once you reach the top of the crunch, hold the position for a moment to feel the contraction of your abdominal muscles. Step 7: Lower your body: Slowly lower yourself back down towards the floor, again using controlled movement, until your head, shoulders, and upper back are flat on the ground. Step 8: Repeat: Perform multiple repetitions of the stomach crunch, aiming for three sets of 12-15 crunches each. Remember to maintain proper form throughout the exercise, using your abdominal muscles to power the movement. By following these steps and practicing regularly, you will be able to perform a proper stomach crunch and strengthen your abdominal muscles."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates delivered the commencement address at Harvard University on Thursday, and was awarded the L. L. D. honorary doctorate . \\"Our speaker is known as the most influential entrepreneur of the personal computer revolution. He was named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004, 2005, 2006 and again in 2007, \\" said Harvard's president, Derek Bok. Then Bok spoke more directly to Gates: \\"Just think what you could have achieved if you had stayed another two years.\\" Gates told the students, many of whom will soon be launching into full-time careers, that work isn't the only thing of importance. \\"Judge yourself not on the professional accomplishments but on how well you have addressed the world's inequities, how you have treated people who have nothing to do with you,\\" he said.

Information: - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the United States Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the \\"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"CJCS\\"), \\"Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"VCJCS\\"), and the Military Service Chiefs from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, all appointed by the President following Senate confirmation. Each of the individual Military Service Chiefs, outside of their Joint Chiefs of Staff obligations, works directly for the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, i.e., Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - William Joseph ( \`\` Wild Bill '' ) Donovan ( January 1 , 1883 -- February 8 , 1959 ) was a United States soldier , lawyer , intelligence officer and diplomat . Donovan is best remembered as the wartime head of the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency , during World War II. He is also known as the \`\` Father of American Intelligence '' and the \`\` Father of Central Intelligence '' . A decorated veteran of World War I , General Donovan is the only person to have received all four of the United States ' highest awards : The Medal of Honor , the Distinguished Service Cross , the Distinguished Service Medal , and the National Security Medal . He is also a recipient of the Silver Star and Purple Heart , as well as decorations from a number of other nations for his service during both World Wars . - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.

Options: - fort - orphans - battlefield - other countries - war The answer is \\"battlefield\\" because","completion":"John joined the army with the intention of seeing the world. However, once the fighting began, his experiences were likely limited due to the nature of his job and the location of the conflict. Among the given options, the answer \\"battlefield\\" is the most appropriate because: 1. The main purpose of an army is to engage in warfare and protect the country. When the fighting starts, members of the army are deployed to the battlefield, where they engage in combat with the enemy. This means John would have spent most of his time in the battlefield rather than exploring other aspects of the world. 2. While options such as \\"fort\\" and \\"other countries\\" may be relevant to an army member's experiences, these options represent locations or facilities rather than the main focus of John's experiences during the fighting. The battlefield is the central location where the fighting takes place, making it the most relevant answer. 3. Options such as \\"orphans\\" and \\"war\\" are related to the consequences of war. However, they do not accurately represent what John would have primarily seen while he was engaged in the fighting. The battlefield encompasses a wider range of experiences that John might have encountered during the fighting. By considering these factors, it becomes evident that the answer \\"battlefield\\" best represents what John would have mostly seen during the fighting, as it aligns with his role as a member of the army and the central focus of his experiences during wartime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They arrive at a small cabin near Øksfjord, about a 45-minute walk from the road where they have left their cars.

During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death.

Article: An apple is just an apple, right? Not when you've got a Fuji, a Golden Delicious, a Baldwin, and a Rome to choose between. There are literally hundreds of varieties of eating apples, cultivated for different properties of flavor and texture. While some are more available than others, depending on where you live, learning some basics will help you get the right kind of apple for your tastes. If you like sweet apples, Fuji, Jazz, Golden Delicious, and McIntosh are all creamy and sweet choices. If you like crunchy apples, Pink Lady, Honey Crisp, and Gala will give you the tooth you're looking for. If you want to bake with your apples, or like tart apples, Granny Smiths, Braeburns, and Jona golds are all solid choices. At the store, or if you're really fortunate in the orchard, check to make sure that apples are firm to the touch and fragrant. A ripe apple should feel firm and should smell like an apple at the stem and at the blossom end. Some apples, like the Macintosh or the Jonathan, will feel slightly softer to the touch, because the flesh is somewhat mealier. That's perfectly fine. If they smell ripe, they are good to eat. Look for bruising, discolouration, and signs of worm infestation in your apples. Apples with brown soft spots or dark holes that look burrowed into the flesh should be avoided. Little superficial dark dots on the skin of the apple are fine to eat, however. In general, you're looking for signs of over-ripeness, not under-ripeness. All apples you get at the store should be ripe enough to eat right away. You're just trying to make sure you don't get any over-aged apples. Apples are harvested at their peak of ripeness, so they're perfectly fine to eat right away. You can keep them on the counter for a day or two. If you don't want to eat your apples right away, keep them in the refrigerator in a paper bag. Good either way. Saying that one bad apple spoils the bunch is more than just a tidy phrase. Apples produce ethylene as they ripen, which promotes ripening in other fruits around them. Never store apples in closed plastic bags, or they'll ripen and spoil very quickly. Go with paper. If you want to store a sliced apple or a halved apple, do so in the refrigerator. These will dry out and brown very quickly, but a little spritz of lemon juice on the flesh of the apple will help to keep it fresh for longer. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: There are hundreds of apple varieties tailored to different taste preferences, including sweet, crunchy, and tart apples. When selecting apples, look for firm, fragrant, and ripe ones, without bruising or signs of worm infestation.

Read this: Corruption is not specific to poor, developing, or transition countries. In western countries, cases of bribery and other forms of corruption in all possible fields exist: under-the-table payments made to reputed surgeons by patients attempting to be on top of the list of forthcoming surgeries, bribes paid by suppliers to the automotive industry in order to sell low-quality connectors used for instance in safety equipment such as airbags, bribes paid by suppliers to manufacturers of defibrillators (to sell low-quality capacitors), contributions paid by wealthy parents to the \\"social and culture fund\\" of a prestigious university in exchange for it to accept their children, bribes paid to obtain diplomas, financial and other advantages granted to unionists by members of the executive board of a car manufacturer in exchange for employer-friendly positions and votes, etc. Examples are endless. These various manifestations of corruption can ultimately present a danger for the public health; they can discredit specific, essential institutions or social relationships. These types of corruption can harm what? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The types of corruption mentioned in the text can harm several aspects of society, including public health, trust in essential institutions, social relationships, and overall integrity of various sectors. By engaging in corrupt practices, such as bribery and under-the-table payments, the quality and efficiency of services in different fields, such as healthcare, automotive industry, and education, can be compromised. Firstly, public health can be negatively impacted when corrupt practices result in the use of low-quality materials or components in safety equipment and medical devices. As mentioned in the examples provided, instances such as low-quality connectors in airbags and low-quality capacitors in defibrillators can lead to life-threatening situations when these devices fail to perform properly. Moreover, when people make under-the-table payments to receive medical treatments ahead of others, it jeopardizes the fairness in access to healthcare services that should be prioritized based on need and urgency, not on financial capability. Secondly, these corrupt practices can discredit essential institutions, such as prestigious universities and businesses, as their reputation and credibility are severely tarnished. When people become aware that contributions, bribes, or other illegal means are being used to gain undeserved advantages, the public's trust in these institutions is diminished, leading to potential funding issues or decreased enrollment/participation. Thirdly, social relationships can become strained due to corruption. Unfair advantages gained through corruption can lead to envy, suspicion, and resentment among the general public or among peers in a community. This can further exacerbate social divisions and create tension between different groups or individuals. Lastly, corruption in various sectors damages the overall integrity of the system, leading to inefficiency, mismanagement, and a lack of accountability. When corruption becomes commonplace, people lose faith in the institutions, which can weaken their effectiveness and stifle innovation and progress. In conclusion, the types of corruption described in the text can have severe consequences for public health, trust in essential institutions, social relationships, and the overall integrity of different sectors of society. It is crucial to address and combat corruption in order to maintain a fair, transparent, and efficient system that serves the best interest of the public."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tanya made a delicious homemade chocolate cake for Megan , and Pick from: *Tanya enjoyed making it.. *Megan enjoyed making it..","completion":"Tanya enjoyed making it. Tanya had always been passionate about baking, ever since she was a little girl helping her mother in the kitchen. It was no surprise that she had become well-known among her circle of friends for her baking skills, particularly her decadent chocolate cakes. This particular cake was special, though. It was for Megan, Tanya's dear friend since childhood, who was celebrating her birthday. Over the years, their friendship had been through so much, from school days to first crushes, from traveling together to witnessing each other's weddings. Their bond had stood the test of time, making Tanya all the more determined to make the perfect cake for Megan's special day. Tanya began her preparation by choosing the highest quality ingredients for the cake. She decided to use organic flour, farm-fresh eggs, and premium grade cocoa powder. The real Belgian chocolate chips she had bought earlier only added to the excitement she felt while making the cake. The process was methodical; Tanya patiently whisked the dry ingredients, then added eggs one at a time, as well as a perfect blend of vanilla extract and melted butter. She meticulously folded the wet and dry ingredients together, ensuring a smooth, velvety batter that would yield a delicious chocolaty taste. Throughout the process, Tanya enjoyed the various scents and textures of her creation. The smell of melted chocolate, the feeling of the batter between her fingers, and even the gentle sound of the mixer whisking everything together brought her immense satisfaction. She recalled the first chocolate cake she had made with her beloved mother when she was only eight years old. The memory of her mother's smile and the joy they shared as they baked together only added to Tanya's determination to craft the perfect cake for Megan. Once the cake was in the oven, Tanya moved onto the next challenge: the frosting. As the aroma of the cake wafted through her kitchen, she carefully melted the chocolate to create a luscious ganache. Adding a dash of cream and a hint of salt, she managed to balance the flavors impeccably. As the timer rang, signaling the cake's completion, Tanya carefully removed it from the oven and allowed it to cool on a wire rack. She couldn't help but beam with pride as she observed her masterpiece. With a deft hand, she spread the ganache evenly over the cake and used the back of a spoon to create decorative swirls along the sides and on the top. Tanya thought back to all of the trials and tribulations her friendship with Megan had withstood. It seemed fitting that her labor of love, this homemade chocolate cake, would serve as a tangible representation of that enduring bond. It wasn't just about the cake; it was an encapsulation of their life-long friendship, filled with love, passion, and dedication. Tanya couldn't help but smile as she thought about Megan's reaction when she would see and taste the cake. The effort she had put into creating this culinary delight reflected the depth of their friendship, and she knew Megan would treasure every bite. As Tanya admired her handiwork and prepared to bring the cake to the birthday celebration, she felt grateful for the love and joy that making this cake, and her friend Megan, had brought to her life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In 1842, Deburau was inadvertently responsible for translating Pierrot into the realm of tragic myth, heralding the isolated and doomed figure--often the fin-de-siecle artist's alter-ego--of Decadent, Symbolist, and early Modernist art and literature. In that year, Gautier, drawing upon Deburau's newly acquired audacity as a Pierrot, as well as upon the Romantics' store of Shakespearean plots and of Don-Juanesque legend, published a \\"review\\" of a pantomime he claimed to have seen at the Funambules. He entitled it \\"Shakespeare at the Funambules\\", and in it he summarized and analyzed an unnamed pantomime of unusually somber events: Pierrot murders an old-clothes man for garments to court a duchess, then is skewered in turn by the sword with which he stabbed the peddler when the latter's ghost lures him into a dance at his wedding. The pantomime under \\"review\\" was a fabrication (though it inspired a hack to turn it into an actual pantomime, The Ol' Clo's Man [1842], in which Deburau probably appeared--and also inspired Barrault's wonderful recreation of it in Children of Paradise). But it importantly marked a turning-point in Pierrot's career: henceforth Pierrot could bear comparisons with the serious over-reachers of high literature, like Don Juan or Macbeth; he could be a victim--even unto death--of his own cruelty and daring. When Gustave Courbet drew a crayon illustration for The Black Arm (1856), a pantomime by Fernand Desnoyers written for another mime, Paul Legrand (see next section), the Pierrot who quakes with fear as a black arm snakes up from the ground before him is clearly a child of the Pierrot in The Ol' Clo's Man. So, too, are Honore Daumier's Pierrots: creatures often suffering a harrowing anguish. In 1860, Deburau was directly credited with inspiring such anguish, when, in a novella called Pierrot by Henri Riviere, the mime-protagonist blames his real-life murder of a treacherous Harlequin on Baptiste's \\"sinister\\" cruelties. Among the most celebrated of pantomimes in the latter part of the century would appear sensitive moon-mad souls duped into criminality--usually by love of a fickle Columbine--and so inevitably marked for destruction (Paul Margueritte's Pierrot, Murderer of His Wife [1881]; the mime Severin's Poor Pierrot [1891]; Catulle Mendes' Ol' Clo's Man [1896], modeled on Gautier's \\"review\\").

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

A Bill of Divorcement describes a day in the lives of a middle-aged Englishwoman named Margaret \\"Meg\\" Fairfield; her daughter Sydney; Sydney's fiancé Kit Humphreys; Meg's fiancé Gray Meredith; and Meg's husband Hilary, who escapes after spending almost twenty years in a mental hospital. After the family discusses Hilary's genetic predisposition toward psychiatric problems, which Sydney seems to have inherited, Hilary and Sydney give up Meg and Kit in order to avoid passing this trait to future generations. The film begins on Christmas Eve as Meg gives a party in her comfortable English manor. In addition to dancing and listening to Christmas carols, Sydney and Kit happily discuss their future together, as do Meg and Gray. The only unpleasant moment of the evening occurs when the singers dedicate their performance of God Bless the Master of This House to Gray. Hilary's sister Hester objects to this because she considers Hilary to be the master of the house even though he is psychotic and institutionalized. On Christmas morning, while Meg and Gray are at church, the asylum telephones to say that Hilary has gone missing, and Hester unintentionally reveals to Sydney that insanity runs in their family. The family's official explanation of Hilary's troubles has been that he experienced shell shock while fighting in World War I, but another family member had similar problems in the past. Hester and Sydney discuss Hilary's talent as a composer, and Sydney sits down at the piano to play an unfinished sonata that Hilary wrote before going to war. A few minutes later, Hilary returns home, having escaped from the asylum. He meets Sydney and they chat comfortably, except for a heated argument that serves to further display their similarities as sensitive, free-spirited individuals.

What is the answer to this question? what is the area code of jeddah saudi arabia?","completion":"The area code for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is +966 12. To provide more context, the area codes in Saudi Arabia are part of a larger numbering plan. This numbering plan has been adopted to facilitate and organize telephone communications within the country and is applicable both for domestic and international calls. To break down the Jeddah area code: - +966: This is the country code for Saudi Arabia. When dialing internationally or using international calling apps, you are required to include this code to reach a Saudi Arabian phone number. It is also needed for any incoming international calls. - 12: This is the specific area code for the city of Jeddah. It is crucial to include this code when dialing a local number within the city, as well as when calling the city from different parts of Saudi Arabia or other countries worldwide. When making a phone call to Jeddah from outside Saudi Arabia, the format would be as follows: +966 12 xxxx-xxxx. If you are calling from within Saudi Arabia but outside Jeddah, the format is simply 012 xxxx-xxxx. In summary, the area code for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is +966 12, with +966 being the country code for Saudi Arabia and 12 as the city-specific code.

What Hopkins means is that with a new coaching staff a new style and new expectations even the players that are returning from last year are just like the incoming freshmen. \\"I think the biggest thing is we've focused on the day-to-day how we're going to do the process of getting better \\" Hopkins said. \\"That's the standard of excellence every day and everybody here is learning a new system. A lot of the players end up being freshmen again because they're learning from our zone to our press to how we're going to play offensively defensively. I think they've made the transition pretty smooth.\\" Hopkins also had to recruit those who slogged through a 9-22 record a season ago to keep them around. A number considered leaving. Most including starters David Crisp Noah Dickerson and Matisse Thybulle all ended up staying with the chance to create the new foundation for the next chapter at Washington. \\"The biggest concern with a new coach is the buy-in there \\" Hopkins said. \\"I think from the beginning our staff did a great job of really connecting with the kids working with them developing them getting them to stay that was our first priority. I'm very happy with the guys.\\" IN THE ZONE: Yes Washington will play zone. Yes it will be the same zone defense that Hopkins helped teach at Syracuse. Defense was a major problem in the waning years of Romar's tenure. The Huskies' defense was more of a liability that an asset. How Hopkins is able to implement the zone will be important since the Huskies don't have a lot of size on the interior. A year ago Washington allowed 81 points per game 11th in the conference. \\"I know the benefits of it. The biggest thing I want to do is control tempo. So if you're fast I can slow you down; if you're slow I can speed you up \\" Hopkins said. FINDING SCORING: One of Hopkins ' first tasks will be finding enough scoring. Crisp is Washington's leading returning scorer at 13.8 points per game while Dickerson averaged 12.5 points last season. But the Huskies don't have an obvious scorer on the roster that can carry the load or get points in crucial situations. In recent seasons the Huskies have had Markelle Fultz Andrew Andrews and C.J. Wilcox. Fultz averaged 23.2 points last season while Andrews scored 20.9 per game the season before. DIFFICULT BEGINNING: Hopkins certainly isn't shying away from having a challenging schedule to begin his Washington tenure.
