Q:Information: - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used. - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Commuter rail, also called suburban rail, is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates between a city centre, and the middle to outer suburbs beyond 15 km (10 miles) and commuter towns or other locations that draw large numbers of commuterspeople who travel on a daily basis. Trains operate following a schedule, at speeds varying from 50 to 200 km/h (30 to 125 mph). Distance charges or zone pricing may be used. - Shosholoza Meyl is a division of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) that operates long-distance (intercity) passenger rail services. It operates various train routes across South Africa, carrying approximately 4 million passengers annually. Before 2009, Shosholoza Meyl was a division of Spoornet, but it was transferred after the formation of PRASA. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Botswana , officially the Republic of Botswana, is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as \\"Batswana\\" (singular: \\"Motswana\\"). Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966. Since then, it has maintained a strong tradition of stable representative democracy, with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa ( PRASA ) is a South African state owned enterprise responsible for most passenger rail services in the country .

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies? Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects. Answer:","completion":"The name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies is Deal."},{"prompt":"Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Don't Waste Your Money Or Time Review: I should have read the reviews before buying this collection.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you're not you know maybe you don't uh can't get as comfortable to sit down and you know like when i'm writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I am in better comfort when Im working on training material.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it seems that the hypothesis \\"I am in better comfort when I'm working on training material\\" can be inferred as true. However, we should consider the context and supporting evidence before drawing a final conclusion. In the premise, the speaker discusses feeling stiff and uncomfortable while wearing a suit, which seems to hinder their ability to work on writing training material. Also, they mentioned that they prefer to be more comfortable while working unless there is a customer meeting later during the day. This suggests that, without the constraints of formal attire, the speaker would be more at ease and better positioned to focus on their work. To support the hypothesis, we can consider the following points: 1. Comfort and productivity: Numerous studies have shown that comfort is important for productivity in the workplace. If the speaker is more comfortable while working on training material, it is likely they can produce better quality work and complete tasks more efficiently. 2. Dress code: The premise suggests that the speaker's comfort level is impacted by their attire, specifically when wearing a suit. It is reasonable to assume that if the speaker is allowed to dress more casually when working on training material, their comfort and productivity will increase. 3. Physical environment: Apart from clothing, other aspects of the physical environment can influence a person's comfort level, such as ergonomic furniture, lighting, and temperature. It would be beneficial to explore if any of these factors contribute to the speaker's comfort while working on training material. 4. Work schedule and meetings: The speaker mentions that needing to meet with a customer later in the day influences their attire and comfort. It may be valuable to assess if adjusting the work schedule or separating tasks requiring formal attire from those related to creating training materials can improve the speaker's comfort. While the hypothesis appears to be true based on the provided premise, it is important to consider additional factors that may impact the speaker's comfort and productivity while working on training material. By examining the factors mentioned above, we can better assess the overall validity of the hypothesis and identify ways to support the speaker's comfort during their work process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. But I can use this background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. What is an answer for this question: Which test would need higher temperature, case A or case B?

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea and its neighbors in the region reacted with caution to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision Thursday to cancel the U.S.- North Korea nuclear summit. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement released by the North’s central news agency (KCNA) that his country remains open to resolving problems with the United States “whenever and however,” and offered praise for President Trump’s diplomatic engagement efforts. “We had held in high regards President Trump’s efforts, unprecedented by any other president, to create a historic North Korea-U.S. summit,” said the vice foreign minister in a statement released Friday by KCNA. The conciliatory tone that came from Vice Foreign Minister Kim stands in sharp contrast to earlier criticisms, insults and threats made by another North Korean official that prompted Trump to cancel the June summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. On Thursday North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui called U.S. Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” and threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” with the U.S. over comments made by Pence calling for North Korea to follow the Libya denuclearization model. The Libya model refers to the rapid and complete dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program in 2003 and 2004, before the easing of any sanctions. But North Korea is acutely aware that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by his own people a few years later, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the United States. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until its undefined security demands are met. Trump blamed the “tremendous anger and open hostility” from Pyongyang for forcing the cancelation of the summit, but many analysts say the issue was more about substance over tone and the unbridgeable gap between the two denuclearization positions. But... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is the U.S. trying to obtain from North Korea? Options: A. an end to any diplomatic effort B. a nuclear showdown C. denuclearization D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"C. denuclearization Justification: The text states that Vice President Mike Pence called for North Korea to follow the \\"Libya denuclearization model.\\" This indicates that the U.S. is attempting to obtain denuclearization from North Korea. Furthermore, the text details how North Korea has responded to these calls, indicating that the topic of denuclearization is a central issue between the two countries. Hence, the correct answer is option C."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker. Several people, including Robert Hooke, had built compound microscopes and were making important discoveries with them during Leeuwenhoek’s time.

Background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

The new Amorite monarchs gave or let out for an indefinite period numerous parcels of royal or sacerdotal land, freed the inhabitants of several cities from taxes and forced labour, which seems to have encouraged a new society to emerge: a society of big farmers, free citizens and enterprising merchants, which was to last throughout the ages. The priest assumed the service of the gods and cared for the welfare of his subjects, but the economic life of the country was no longer exclusively (or almost exclusively) in their hands. In general terms, Mesopotamian civilization survived the arrival of Amorites, as the indigenous Babylonian civilisation had survived the short period of Gutian dynasty of Sumer's domination of the south during the restless period after the fall of the Akkadian Empire that had preceded the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur (the \\"Neo-Sumerian Empire\\"). The religious, ethical, technological, scientific and artistic directions in which Mesopotamia had been developing since the 4th millennium BC were not greatly affected by the Amorites' hegemony. They continued to worship the Sumero-Akkadian gods, and the older Sumerian myths and epic tales were piously copied, translated, or adapted, generally with only minor alterations. As for the scarce artistic production of the period, there is little to distinguish it from the preceding Ur III era. The era of the Amorite kingdoms, c. 2000 - 1595 BC, is sometimes known as the \\"Amorite period\\" in Mesopotamian history. The principal Amorite dynasties arose in Mari, Yamhad, Qatna, fairly briefly in Assyria (under Shamshi-Adad I), Isin, Larsa and Babylon. Babylon, originally a minor state at its founding in 1894 BC, became briefly the major power in the ancient world during the reign of Hammurabi in the first part of the 18th century BC, and it was from then that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia, the north long before it evolved into Assyria. Answer this question \\"Why did Amorites hegemony did not have effects ?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"The Amorite hegemony did not have significant effects on Mesopotamian civilization because the religious, ethical, technological, scientific, and artistic directions in which Mesopotamia had been developing since the 4th millennium BC were not greatly affected.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? merely pretentious --","completion":"The phrase \\"merely pretentious\\" can be considered as having a negative connotation for various reasons. To understand the negativity behind this phrase, one must first analyze both \\"merely\\" and \\"pretentious\\" separately and then examine their combined meaning. “Merely” is an adverb that is usually employed to downplay the importance or significance of something. It can be used to indicate that the subject matter is of little consequence, unimportant, or negligible, often creating a sense of unworthiness or insignificance. In this case, merely serves as a minimizer, diminishing the value of what comes after it. \\"Pretentious,\\" on the other hand, is an adjective that describes a person or situation that displays an exaggerated sense of importance or worth, often with the intent of impressing others. Pretentiousness is commonly seen as a negative trait because it implies a kind of dishonesty or lack of authenticity. This term is often used in situations where someone tries to appear more knowledgeable, cultured, or sophisticated than they genuinely are for the sake of impressing others or appearing superior. When we combine these two words into the phrase \\"merely pretentious,\\" the negative connotations are quite evident. It suggests that whatever is being referred to not only lacks real value or importance (due to the use of \\"merely\\"), but also tries to give off a false impression of worth (through the use of \\"pretentious\\"). This phrase implies that the object or person in question is superficial, insincere, and of limited value due to their pretentious nature. To put it into context, if a movie or a piece of art is described as \\"merely pretentious,\\" it means that it not only fails to live up to its potential or promises but is also overtly attempting to appear more intellectual or significant than it actually is. This double blow of superficiality and dishonesty makes the phrase \\"merely pretentious\\" decidedly negative. In summary, the phrase \\"merely pretentious\\" carries a negative connotation, primarily due to the combined effect of the words \\"merely\\" and \\"pretentious.\\" It suggests a situation or person that is inauthentic, insincere, and of little value, qualities that are generally perceived unfavorably in most contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary. His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing. The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church. As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man. At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw. But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road. As he did so he glanced back. A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it. He was now bending down, probably with the object of concealing his identity, and had moved on a few paces farther down the road.

US director William Friedkin speaks on May 18, 2016 during \\"La Lecon de Cinema\\", a masterclass at the 69th Cannes Film Festival (AFP Photo/Anne-Christine Poujoulat) Cannes (France) (AFP) - William Friedkin, the director of the horror classic \\"The Exorcist\\", has revealed that he was allowed to film a real exorcism at the Vatican earlier this month. The 80-year-old American filmmaker told a masterclass at the Cannes film festival late Thursday that he was invited by Rome's exorcist to record the event. \\"I was invited by the Vatican exorcist to shoot and video an actual exorcism which... few people have ever seen and which nobody has ever photographed,\\" he said. Friedkin said he was taken aback at how close the ceremony was to the exorcism depicted in his 1973 film. \\"I was pretty astonished by that. I don't think I will ever be the same having seen this astonishing thing. \\"I am not talking about some cult, I am talking about an exorcism by the Catholic Church in Rome,\\" he added. But the Vatican denied \\"making any such invitation. The Vatican (itself) does not have an exorcist,\\" a spokesman told AFP. Each Catholic diocese has an exorcist and papal universities regularly organise training for the exorcism. \\"People often confuse any Catholic initiative/organisation/person with the Vatican. Perhaps this is the case here,\\" he added. The director said he intended to shoot \\"The Exorcist\\" -- based on a bestselling novel by William Peter Blatty -- as a horror movie, but the more he learned the more it became a story of the supernatural instead. While the book was based on the 1949 case of an American teenager called Roland, Friedkin said the Catholic \\"archdiocese of Washington DC asked Blatty to change the gender (in the novel) so as not to draw attention to the young man.\\" - Demonic possession - But in reality, the director said, \\"it was a young man of 14 years, not a girl\\" who was allegedly possessed. The film recounts the demonic possession of a 12-year-old girl and her mother's attempts to win her back through a rite conducted by two priests. Friedkin said he believed the boy was genuinely possessed. \\"I'm convinced that there was no other explanation. I read the diaries not only of the priest involved (in the exorcism), but the doctors, the nurses and the patients at Alexian Brothers Hospital in Saint Louis where this case was carried out,\\" he added. \\"Everything having to do with medical science and psychiatry was attempted. This young men suffered from afflictions very similar to what's in the film, as hard is that is to believe.\\" The exorcism scenes in the film has been repeatedly voted among some of the scariest ever shown in cinemas. \\"When I started I thought I was making a horror film and then the priest, who was the president of Georgetown University (in Washington DC), let me read these diaries and I knew that it was not a horror film,\\" Friedkin said. \\"This was a case of exorcism.\\" - 'I believed' - \\"I believed in this story,\\" Friedkin told the audience in Cannes, referring to the original possession of the boy. \\"I made this story as a believer. I'm not Catholic, I don't go to church, I don't belong to a church or a synagogue. \\"I do believe in the teachings of Jesus,\\" Friedkin added, whose parents were Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. \\"I believe they are incredibly profound and beautiful and we know that this character existed... the supernatural aspect I leave to each person's conscience and belief system,\\" he added. \\"I don't intend to join a church and yet what amazes me... is the fact that this man (Jesus) over 2,000 years ago preached in the desert, on street corners and in synagogues and there is no recording of his voice... yet billions of people have believed in the idea of Jesus Christ. \\"There must be something in there,\\" said Friedkin, who also made \\"The French Connection\\", and was with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich one of the leaders of the \\"New Hollywood\\" group of filmmakers in the early 1970s. ||||| (The Exorcist/Fox Broadcasting Co.) William Friedkin, acclaimed director of “The Exorcist,” says he’s now seen the real thing — and filmed it. Talking to an audience at the Cannes Film Festival in France on Thursday, the 80-year-old filmmaker said that the Vatican invited him to film an exorcism earlier in May. The version he constructed for the 1973 supernatural horror film, Friedkin added, was not that far from the actual rite he recently documented. “I don’t think I will ever be the same having seen this astonishing thing,” he said, according to Agence France-Presse. “I am not talking about some cult, I am talking about an exorcism by the Catholic Church in Rome.” A representative for the Vatican countered the claim that it had invited Friedkin, noting that it currently does not have an official exorcist. However, the spokesman told the AFP that it is possible Friedkin was confusing another Catholic initiative with the Vatican. That’s not to say the Catholic Church lacks exorcists. In 1999, the church updated its manual on exorcisms: De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus Quibusdam, or Of Exorcisms and Certain Supplications. It was, perhaps, overdue — its predecessor had been written in 1614. The recent revision emphasizes that exorcists must first rule that possession is not mental illness, through medical and psychiatric evaluation. De Exorcismis also opines that media coverage and other spectacle be eschewed. According to Friedkin, “nobody has ever photographed” an official exorcism, making his purported documentation of the event all the more momentous. De Exorcismis, of course, still refers to devils and a sentient Satan on the hunt for souls. As Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez said in a presentation in 1999, however, it has “more sober language, with fewer adjectives than in the previous one,” according to the Guardian. [An exorcist told us how to rid Ted Cruz of Lucifer, just in case John Boehner is right] Official exorcisms are few and far between. But demand for exorcisms, to hear the Church tell it, jumped in the latter half of the last century and picked up steam toward its end. By 2004, Pope John Paul II called for every bishop to have an exorcist in his diocese. Ten years later, the Vatican officially recognized the 250-strong International Association of Exorcists. And by 2015, the Catholic Register reported that the “once dying trade” now claims over 100 North American members. Exorcist and Toronto priest Gary Thomas, who told the Register he’d performed about a dozen exorcisms in the past decade, says exorcisms have drama, though they are not a “Ghostbusters”-style race to the scene. “Some of what you would see in a movie, some of it is accurate and some of it is not.” But spectacle is not the point, he noted at Vice — the ministry of exorcism is an exercise in healing. Pope Francis has been a frequent and outspoken critic of Satan, also stoking support for exorcisms. “Pope Francis never stops talking about the Devil; it’s constant,” an anonymous bishop told the Washington Post in 2014. Catholic critics say Francis is catalyzing superstition within the Church; others, like Thomas, argue that it’s a reaction to growing evil influences. “Society is becoming rapidly more pagan,” as the exorcist said to the Register. Friedkin is not Catholic but says he believes in Jesus’s teachings. He also believes in the validity of the exorcism at Saint Louis University that served as a basis for his movie. “When I started I thought I was making a horror film and then the priest, who was the president of Georgetown University (in Washington DC), let me read these diaries and I knew that it was not a horror film,” Friedkin said, according to AFP. “This was a case of exorcism.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"William Friedkin, the director of the famous horror movie \\"The Exorcist\\", recently said that he was allowed to film a real exorcism at the Vatican.

UPDATED:. 07:45 EST, 18 November 2013. The embattled mayor of Toronto has admitted to getting 'professional help' for his emotional problems, but still insists he isn't an addict and doesn't need drug treatment. Rob Ford made a very public appearance today at a Canadian Football League playoff game to cheer on the Toronto Argonauts - despite the CFL commissioner's pleas that he stay away from the game. The Toronto city council voted Friday to strip the mayor of some of his powers. That effort will continue Monday when the council moves to deny Ford most of his remaining powers, including his office budget. It would also appoint the deputy mayor to lead his executive committee. Party animal: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, an avid Toronto Argonauts fan, hold up a makeshift replica of the Grey Cup while attending a playoffs game Sunday. Ford poses with a fellow Canadian Football League fan after making an appearance at the Rogers Centre - despite being warned off by the CFL commissioner. Ford went on Fox News to again apologize for smoking crack cocaine and having 'outbursts.' 'I have admitted to using illegal drugs in the last year, OK? I’ve admitted to drinking too much, OK? so I’m dealing with it. I am training every day. I’m in the gym for two hours every day. I’m seeking professional help,' he said. 'I’m not an alcoholic. I’m not a drug addict.' Ford has remained defiant despite an increasingly-embarrassing list of public statements and admissions about bad behavior. Most recently, he made crude comments about his sex life with his wife - while she was standing with him. He was attempting to dismiss allegations that he had propositioned a female staffer for oral sex. He was wearing a jersey for his beloved Toronto Argonauts at the time - a custom shirt that reads 'Major Ford' on the back. Taunted: A woman holds a sign mocking the rival team's city mayor Rob Ford who was in the crowd watching the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats in Toronto. Spectacle: Rob Ford's appearance Sunday was greeted with significant attention - and some amount of bemusement by football fans. That prompted Argonauts CEO Chris Rudge to call Ford's ongoing calamities 'an unfortunate situation for the city.' CFL Commissioner Mark Cohon asked that Ford to stay away from Sunday's Eastern. Conference final between the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He ignored the calls and Sunday afternoon, shortly after halftime, he took a seat a seat about 20 rows back from the field. His arrival caused a stir in Section 129 of the Rogers Centre, with fans clogging the aisle as they snapped photos and exchanged handshakes with the mayor who recently has acknowledged smoking crack cocaine and drinking excessively. Mocking: A Hamilton Tiger Cats fan holds a cut out poster of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's head during the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats in Toronto. Wearing a dark blue Argonauts jersey with 'Mayor Ford' and the number 12 across the back, Ford laughed and drew cheers as he held aloft a crudely constructed replica of the Grey Cup, Canadian football's championship trophy. Outside the downtown stadium before kickoff, fans of both teams said Ford should stay away from the game. 'He needs to take some time off and get help,' said Bob Walker, dressed in an Argonauts baseball cap and jacket. The city council is seeking to strip the mayor of nearly all of his powers tomorrow. Today he celebrated at football. 'It's definitely a distraction... He means well, he's done well for the city. It's just, it's enough, you know? We need to get on with the city and take his business somewhere else for a bit.' Hamilton fan Shawn Kowalyshyn, wearing a Tiger-Cats jersey, said the mayor has 'embarrassed' himself and his family. 'Unfortunately, I'd like to support him and his policies, but he's just gone too far over the top. ... It's gotten too ridiculous,' Kowalyshyn said. Brothers Kyle and Matt O'Connor of Hamilton held up a hand-lettered sign reading 'Our Mayor Doesn't Smoke Crack!!' as they lined up to wait for stadium gates to open. Earlier Sunday, the 44-year-old Ford was spotted outside the downtown studios of the tabloid Sun News Network, where he and brother Doug, a Toronto city councilor, were taping the first episode of their new current events television show, 'Ford Nation,' which is to air Monday night. Working up a sweat: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford mops his brow as he watches the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats. Meet and greet: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford gets close to a fan of the opposition. Recently released court documents show Ford became the subject of a police investigation after news reports surfaced in May that he had been caught on video smoking crack cocaine. In interviews with police, former staffers accused the mayor of frequently drinking, driving while intoxicated and making sexual advances toward a female staffer. Ford's erratic behavior was parodied in the opening segment of the U.S. comedy show 'Saturday Night Live,' with cast member Bobby Moynihan portraying the mayor who at one point ducks behind the lectern at a press conference to do a drug deal, exclaiming, 'Wow, that's a lot of crack.' Ford finally decides he needs to go on a TV show which would believe him, and then is shown being interviewed by CBS '60 Minutes' correspondent Lara Logan (Kate McKinnon) who accepts his denials that he did crack, smoked marijuana and used alcohol. Logan recently had to apologize on-air for a '60 Minutes' story about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, saying the network could no longer trust the testimony of a former security contractor who had claimed he was present during the attack.","completion":"The Mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, has said that he is getting help for his emotional problems, but insists that he is not an addict and doesn't need drug treatment.

Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

We do this by adding 600 to both sides. 40*w = 600 Step 3: Solve for w To find the value of w, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 40. w = 600 / 40 w = 15 So the solution to the equation is w = 15."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Approximants are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough nor with enough articulatory precision to create turbulent airflow. Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence. This class of sounds includes lateral approximants like (as in \\"less\\"), non-lateral approximants like (as in \\"rest\\"), and semivowels like and (as in \\"yes\\" and \\"west\\", respectively). Before Peter Ladefoged coined the term \\"approximant\\" in the 1960s, the term \\"frictionless continuant\\" referred to non-lateral approximants. Some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms \\"semivowel\\" and \\"glide\\" are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels. Vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with Indo-European ablaut. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel. A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably, remarks that, for example, the final glides of English \\"par\\" and \\"buy\\" differ from French \\"par\\" ('through') and \\"baille\\" ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the syllable coda, whereas, in the former, they appear in the syllable nucleus. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like Italian (with the i-like sound of \\"piede\\" 'foot', appearing in the nucleus: , and that of \\"piano\\" 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset: ) and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being \\"abyecto\\" 'abject' and \\"abierto\\" 'opened'). 1.

Write an article based on this \\"President-elect Donald Trump might come as a shock to many Americans - but for the 600 million people of South East Asia the reaction could well be: \\"Seen it all before.\\"\\" Article:","completion":"Title: South East Asia's Familiarity with Trump-Like Leadership: A Closer Look Introduction In the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential elections, President-elect Donald Trump's victory was met with a range of reactions from around the world. While a significant number of Americans were left shocked and concerned about the future of their country, over 600 million people of South East Asia had a different outlook, feeling a sense of déjà vu with the seemingly novel rise of Trump to power. Indeed, South East Asia has seen political figures similar to Trump in both ideology and leadership style that make his election unsurprising for them. This article aims to explore these striking resemblances and analyze why Trump's presidency feels so familiar to the people of South East Asia. Step 1: Identifying Trump-esque characteristics To truly understand why South East Asians feel like they've seen it all before when discussing Trump, we must first break down the key characteristics that define the US president-elect. Among them are his controversial statements, hard-line policies, volatile temperament, and the overarching belief in nationalist ideals. Step 2: Drawing parallels with South East Asian leaders With these characteristics in mind, it is clear to see how Trump's rise in politics mirrors that of several South East Asian leaders. For instance, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, known for his contentious policies and unpresidential demeanor, shares a similar set of qualities with Trump. Duterte made headlines for his brutal war on drugs, which has resulted in extrajudicial killings, as well as for his inflammatory remarks. In Indonesia, the election of President Joko Widodo was seen as a populist triumph, much like Trump's election. Widodo, a businessman who challenged the political establishment, rose from humble beginnings to become the leader of the world's third largest democracy. His focus on improving infrastructure and standing up to foreign powers resonates with Trump's \\"America First\\" policy. Another example can be seen in Malaysia, where former Prime Minister Najib Razak, was surrounded by corruption allegations, demonstrating the narrative of a businessman-like leader enmeshed in scandal - similar to Trump's own history of legal woes. Step 3: Analyzing South East Asia's familiarity with populist sentiment Throughout the years, South East Asia has faced multiple examples of populist sentiments taking root in the political sphere. The rise of authoritarian leaders in the region has historically been fueled by nationalist ideology and anti-establishment feelings, many of which are echoed in the United States through Trump's populist agenda. This familiarity with populist leaders and the disillusionment with traditional politics could explain why South East Asians are less shocked than others by Trump's election as president of the United States. Conclusion Ultimately, the key elements that define President-elect Trump's controversial character and political approach have been evident in various South East Asian leaders in recent years. From Duterte's strongman tactics to Widodo's populist appeal, South East Asian citizens have already seen and experienced a variety of leaders who mirror Trump's brash persona and nationalistic policies. As a result, the people of South East Asia may view Trump's presidency as less of a surprise and more of a continuation of a global political trend that they have already witnessed firsthand in their own region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, the subject 'The NBA' is performing an action - refusing to write up a new compromise with 'them' (which, again as per common syntax rules, refers to 'players' as it is used right after mentioning 'players'). Therefore, in this context, 'they' shows the entity that is refusing to draft a new compromise, which is 'The NBA'.

Stepping through the given tweet: \\"@Megmatthews20 I don't blame you! But, still... watch them!\\" Here we know the user is communicating with @Megmatthews20. There is not a clear sentiment in the addressal, it simply initiates the conversation. \\"I don't blame you!\\" suggests a supportive sentiment. It's often used when expressing understanding or empathy towards the recipient's previous actions or decisions, which leans towards a positive sentiment. \\"But, still... watch them!\\" is a suggestion or perhaps a warning but doesn't convey a clear positive or negative sentiment on its own. It's more a neutral precaution given to the recipient. So, combining these two statements: The positive sentiment in \\"I don't blame you!\\" coupled with the neutral sentiment of \\"But, still... watch them!\\" seems to give an overall sentiment leaning towards positivity but retaining some neutrality. However, the given options are only negative or positive. Upon weighing these considerations, here's my answer: Answer: [ii] positive.

Your job is to slightly modify the middle part, so that the whole story becomes unlikely, improbable, or inconsistent. Generated sentences must minimally alter the given middle, with at most 4 new words added/existing words removed. Your sentence should be grammatically and syntactically correct. Also stick to the context of the given story. For example, if the story talks about \\"doctors\\", you can talk about \\"health\\" or \\"diagnosis\\", but don't mention \\"aliens\\". Avoid introducing any extra/irrelevant information, and use names instead of pronouns (e.g. he / she) wherever possible. Avoid simply negating the original middle, for example: \\"She likes cakes.\\" is changed to \\"She doesn't like cakes.\\" Problem:Beginning: Gloria wanted to buy flowers for her husband. Middle: Gloria gave her husband some flowers. Ending: Gloria's husband appreciated the gesture. Solution:","completion":"This task is asking you to modify the middle part of a story in a way that makes the entirety of the story unlikely or inconsistent. The key here is minimalism - you're allowed to add or remove at most 4 words. You should also ensure whatever changes you make stick to the context of the existing story. The provided story revolves around a character named Gloria purchasing flowers for her husband, who appreciates her gesture in the end. The middle part to be changed is: \\"Gloria gave her husband some flowers.\\" Here are the steps you would follow: 1. Understand the original story. In this case, Gloria wants to buy flowers for her husband, does, and her husband appreciates it. 2. Identify an element in the middle part that can be changed in a way that it deviates the story without interrupting its grammar, structure, or context. 3. Modify this element in a way that it does not conform to the events mentioned in the beginning and/or end of the story. In the given instance, an example of this might be changing \\"Gloria gave her husband some flowers\\" to \\"Gloria gave her neighbor some flowers\\". This change creates an inconsistency in the story - if Gloria gave the flowers to her neighbor, it would be unlikely that her husband appreciated the gesture, as he was supposed to be the one receiving the flowers.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that created the G minor Piano Sonata? By the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist. Answer:","completion":"The person who created the G minor Piano Sonata is Bedřich Smetana. He composed the sonata during his years of studying theory and composition under Josef Proksch while working as a music teacher for Count Thun's family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(CNN)California health officials said Wednesday there are 79 confirmed measles cases in the state, as federal health authorities reported that the number of U.S. cases in 2014 more than tripled any total in recent years. According to the California Department of Public Health website, 52 of those cases are linked to an outbreak at Disneyland. There are four confirmed cases in Riverside County, where the Desert Sands Unified School District told 66 students -- who have either not been vaccinated for measles or can't show proof -- that they need to stay home. CNN affiliate KESQ reported that one student at Palm Desert High School is suspected of having had measles. The student has been cleared to return to class but health officials are still trying to determine if the student actually had measles. For now, the others will have to study at their homes. \\"They are going to be asked to stay home until the incubation period for contagion is complete,\\" a spokeswoman for the school district, Mary Perry, said of the students who were released. The earliest a student can return without proof of vaccination is February 9, the station reported. Of the 79 California cases, 15 are in Los Angeles County, and all victims were unvaccinated for measles, said Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, the county's interim health officer. Of those 15 county cases, 14 are linked to Disneyland, Gunzenhauser said. \\"In L.A. County, we're, fortunately, highly vaccinated. Five percent or less are unvaccinated,\\" Gunzenhauser said. There are 16 cases linked to Disneyland outside California (seven in Arizona, three in Utah, two in Washington, one in Colorado, one in Oregon, one in Nebraska and one in Mexico). Arizona officials said they have identified 1,000 contacts of the seven cases in their states. They're asking anyone within that group to isolate themselves for 21 days if he or she isn't vaccinated.

The university is working to find everyone who may have been exposed to the student, who attended class four days last week. Though students have largely been immunized because of enrollment requirements, the university warned anyone who had not been vaccinated to be vigilant. Minnesota is one of 27 states that reported measles cases last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 644 cases reported in 2014 mark a stark spike compared with recent years. Since 2001, the number of cases has topped 100 only five times, and 2011 was the only year in which cases topped 200.

Article: Before you get down and dirty with your hardware and computer settings, check to see what kind of speeds you are getting and compare that to the advertised speeds for your service. There are a variety of speed test sites on the net, just search for \\"speed test\\" in Google and pick the top few results. Different tests will give you different results. Even the same test may give you different results between tests. This is due to the location of test servers and the number of people sharing your connection. Take multiple tests and find the average speed you are getting. You may need to have Flash installed to run the test. If given the option, pick the test server closest to your physical location. This will help get you the most accurate results (on speedtest.net, this is chosen automatically based on ping) Check with your service provider to see what speeds you should be getting. Keep in mind that speeds advertised by your provider are \\"best case\\" speeds, and you may not be able to actually get that number on a regular basis, especially if using WiFi. If you haven't upgraded your internet in a long time, you may be able to get better speeds for less money. Companies aren't usually keen to inform you of better deals, so check to see if new services are available that weren't when you signed up. Check with all the providers in your area. Be aware of the megabyte/megabit difference. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) advertise in megabits, not megabytes. There are 8 megabits (Mb) in a megabyte (MB), so if you are paying for 25 megabits per second (Mbps), then that's just over 3 megabytes per second (MBps) of actual maximum transfer speed. If your test result was measured in Kbps, then you divide that number by 1000 to attain your measurement in Mbps. Restarting your modem and router can help alleviate some network issues by cleaning up old data and re-provisioning your modem configuration from your internet service provider. If necessary, your modem will automatically download firmware updates from the ISP. See this guide for details on resetting your network. If you are using a wireless router, some devices can affect your connection due to interference. Wireless routers come in multiple varieties; 802.11 b, g, and n (2.4 GHz) or 802.11 a (5.8 GHz). Common devices that can interfere with your wireless connection are microwaves and cell phones, many of which operate in the 2.4 GHz range. In order to minimize interference, turn off data on your phone and move your microwave oven away from wireless devices and your router when you're using the connection. Sometimes you just have a bad connection that can only be fixed on your provider's end. They can usually tell if your connection is substandard without having a technician come to your home by reading signal levels off of your modem. If necessary, they will send a line technician out to your house or neighborhood to check their infrastructure. If the problem is on your end, you might be charged a fee for the visit, so it's important to try troubleshooting over the phone or internet first. If you are connected to the internet via a Wi-Fi router, poor signal can lead to lower speeds and dropped connections. Move your router closer to your computer if possible, or move the computer so that it is closer to the router or keep the router on top of a cupboard to transmit better signal. Clean out the dust from your router and modem once in a while using a can of compressed air. This will help keep the unit from overheating and consequently, improve its stability. Maintain proper ventilation around all electrical components to avoid overheating. When you activated DSL, you hooked the line from your phone jack into one side of a rectangular box filter.

It is best to confine start your cat in one room of your house, particularly if it is a kitten. Be sure to put its litter box, food, and water dishes in the room.","completion":"Caring for American Longhair cats involves several aspects such as grooming, diet, healthcare, and giving them a suitable environment. It's essential to give your cat the proper attention and resources it needs to ensure its health and happiness in your home. 1. Grooming: American Longhair cats have a thick, lustrous coat that needs regular grooming to prevent matting, knots, and to keep them looking their best. You should brush your cat's coat at least 2-3 times a week using a high-quality brush or comb that's designed for long-haired cats. This will help remove loose hair, dirt, and dead skin cells, as well as distribute the natural oils in their fur, promoting healthier skin and coat. Regular grooming also helps reduce hairballs and shedding in your home. 2. Diet: Provide a balanced and nutritious diet to your American Longhair cat that caters to their specific needs. A high-quality cat food brand, whether it's wet or dry food, should be given in appropriate portions as per your cat's age, size, and activity level. Make sure that the food has a good source of protein, such as chicken, turkey, or fish, and contains essential vitamins, minerals, and taurine. Don't forget to provide fresh water daily. Consult with your veterinarian if you have any concerns about your cat's diet or nutritional requirements. 3. Healthcare: Schedule regular veterinary checkups for your cat at least once a year. These checkups will help detect any potential health issues early on and ensure that your cat stays up to date with vaccinations and deworming treatments. Dental care is also crucial; your veterinarian can recommend cat-safe toothpaste and toothbrushes to maintain your cat's oral health. Keep an eye on any changes in your cat's behavior, appetite, or energy levels as these could indicate health problems and require immediate attention. 4. Litter Box: Maintain a clean and hygienic litter box for your cat. Choose a litter box that is large enough for your cat to move around comfortably, and place it in a quiet area of your home. Regularly scoop out waste, and change the litter completely at least once a week, or more if needed. This will help prevent unpleasant odors and encourage your cat to use the litter box. 5. Exercise and Mental Stimulation: Encourage your cat to engage in daily play and physical activity to maintain a healthy weight and active lifestyle. Provide interactive toys such as teaser wands, puzzle feeders, and scratching posts to keep your cat stimulated both mentally and physically. Regular playtime will strengthen the bond between you and your cat and help expel any excess energy that may trigger destructive behavior. 6. Socialization and Training: As you've mentioned, introducing a new cat to your home should be done gradually. Allow the cat to become accustomed to the new environment in a single room with its essentials. Once your cat feels comfortable, slowly introduce it to other pets and family members in the household. Positive reinforcement and patience are crucial during this process. If you have other cats, it's essential to provide separate feeding and sleeping areas to minimize territorial disputes. 7. Safety: Ensure that your home is a safe environment for your American Longhair cat. Remove any potentially hazardous items such as toxic plants, small objects that could be swallowed, and any cords or strings that the cat might get tangled in. You should also consider microchipping your cat and getting an ID tag with your name and contact information in case your cat goes missing. By adhering to these guidelines, you will be able to provide a nurturing and safe environment for your American Longhair cat, ensuring its well-being, happiness, and maintaining a strong bond between you and your feline companion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Private First Class Schoenmann died in a North Korean prison camp on December 29, 1950, at the age of 20. He was wounded and suffered days in the frigid cold alone during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, known to Korean War veterans as the ‘frozen Chosin.’ Not forgotten: Private First Class Glenn Schoenmann, who left his family farm in Tennessee to volunteer for the Korean War, is seen in this undated handout photo courtesy of the Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs. Long-awaited service: Schoenmann's personal items were put on display during a funeral for the Korean War veteran who died in a prison camp at the age of 19. The battle took place in late November 1950 as severe winter weather hit North Korea and hundreds of thousands of Communist Chinese troops poured into the country to overturn what had been a largely successful American and United Nations advance. Injured and cut off from his unit, Schoenmann managed to avoid being captured for several days. But eventually, wounded and weakened from the cold, the young soldier was caught and detained in a North Korean prison camp, where he died. His remains were later recovered in 2004 during a brief period of cooperation between the U.S. and North Korea. Schoenmann’s corpse was identified by DNA taken from family members after a nephew’s online ancestry search came to the attention of U.S. authorities involved in recovering Korean War POW remains, the Leaf Chronicle in Tennessee reports. Closure: Sibling Raymond Schoenmann wipes his eyes during the funeral for his brother held at the Grundy County High School in Coalmont, Tennessee.

Preparation for burial: The Army honor guard preparing to move Glenn Schoenmann's to the cemetery. His older brother says he remembers driving him to a bus station in Nashville more than 62 years ago. ‘He knew where he was going,’ Ernest Schoenmann, 86, of Creve Coure, Illinois, told the Chronicle. ‘He said, “I don’t think I’ll ever come home alive.\\" ‘That was hard. Those were the last words I can remember.’ Ernest Schoenmann, who was informed of the positive identification shortly before Thanksgiving, said his family learned a lot about what their sibling went through. ‘They gave me a booklet with an interview with one of the boys who was in prison with him,’ he said. ‘I started to read it, but I couldn’t. It was so horrible.’ Communal dedication: Locals lined the streets during the funeral procession. Proper ceremony: The honor guard carried Schoenmann's casket during the funeral in Palmer, Tennessee, on Saturday, January 12, 2013. Saying goodbye: Ernest, left, and Raymond, right, Schoenmann sat quietly during the funeral service for their brother who was 20 when he died in December 1950. As with thousands of other U.S. soldiers killed in action or by the harsh conditions of their captivity, Schoenmann’s remains were not returned to the U.S. after authorities signed an armistice with North Korea on July 27, 1953. Six decades after the signing of that armistice, over 8,000 U.S. military men and women remain unaccounted for. The Korean War, which was fought between June 25,1950, and July, 27, 1953, has often been referred to as 'The Forgotten War' and 'The Unknown War' due to the lack of public attention it received. Ernest Schoenmann said he wishes other families of missing Korean War service members will still be able to find closure as their loved ones remain half a world away. ‘I just wish more of them were home,’ he said. ‘There’s still so many of them missing over there.’Glenn Schoenmann’s long-awaited funeral was held in Tennessee on Saturday.

In private, he has talked longingly of “going Bulworth,” a reference to a little-remembered 1998 Warren Beatty movie about a senator who risked it all to say what he really thought. While Mr. Beatty’s character had neither the power nor the platform of a president, the metaphor highlights Mr. Obama’s desire to be liberated from what he sees as the hindrances on him. “Probably every president says that from time to time,” said David Axelrod, another longtime adviser who has heard Mr. Obama’s movie-inspired aspiration. “It’s probably cathartic just to say it. But the reality is that while you want to be truthful, you want to be straightforward, you also want to be practical about whatever you’re saying.” The cinematic allusion seems striking given Mr. Obama’s rejection of Hollywood’s version of the White House, what one former aide calls “the Harry Potter theory of the presidency,” which suggests that he could wave a wand and make things happen. At the White House Correspondents Association dinner last month, he bristled at the idea that he should pattern himself after Michael Douglas’s assertive character in “The American President.” Turning to Mr. Douglas, who was in the audience, he jokingly asked what his secret was. “Could it be that you were an actor in an Aaron Sorkin liberal fantasy?” Mr. Obama asked. He added later, “I get frustrated sometimes.” Mr. Obama was more scornful a few days later when a reporter skeptically asked about his prospects for further legislation. “As Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point,” he said. This week, as Mr. Obama confronted a scandal frenzy unlike any he has faced, he let his guard down during fund-raisers in New York. “My thinking was after we beat them in 2012, well, that might break the fever,” he told donors. “And it’s not quite broken yet.” He sounded almost plaintive in wishing he had more ability to advance his agenda. “I sure want to do some governing,” he told another set of contributors. “I want to get some stuff done. I don’t have a lot of time.” Still, as he was traveling on Marine One on Monday, Mr. Obama took note of news reports describing last Friday as a terrible day. “You know what was actually a terrible day?” an aide recalled him saying. “The day Benghazi actually happened.” ||||| Senator Jay Bulworth is facing speculation-induced financial ruin, so he puts out a contract on his own life in order to collect a large, new insurance policy for his family. Living each moment on borrowed time, he suddenly begins spouting raw, unfiltered--and sometimes offensive in word but satirical in spirit -- thoughts to shocked audiences and handlers in the speech of hip-hop music and culture. His newfound uninhibitedness and new relationship with Nina carry him on a journey of political and spiritual renewal. Written by Stuart Hoffman |||||Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the idea of \\"going Bulworth,\\" referencing a 1998 Warren Beatty movie about a senator who decides to speak his mind honestly without fear of consequences. The phrase has been used by President Obama in private to express his frustration with the restrictions placed upon him as president and his desire to speak more candidly about his thoughts and beliefs. David Axelrod, a longtime Obama adviser, notes that it is common for presidents to express such thoughts from time to time, as it is cathartic, but they must balance their honesty with practicality. Obama is described as rejecting Hollywood's portrayal of the presidency, especially the idea that he can easily make things happen, like the fictional president in \\"The American President\\" played by Michael Douglas. Despite this, Obama continues to face challenges in advancing his agenda, leading to frustration and a wish to \\"do some governing.\\" He has expressed disappointment in not being able to break the political fever and move forward with his plans, especially given his limited time left in office. \\"Going Bulworth\\" serves as a potent metaphor for the struggle between the pressures of being in office and the desire for honest, straightforward communication. President Obama, like many leaders before him, wrestles with the expectations placed upon him and his own aspirations for change and progress. The character of Senator Jay Bulworth, who faces political and financial ruin, serves as an interesting counterpoint to Obama, revealing a story of political and spiritual renewal that can resonate with those grappling with limitations in power and communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and... Why are some teams not productive - Because some ideas are ten-a-penny - Because the work can be complex - Because its too easy - not enough information A:","completion":"To help address these productivity challenges and foster a culture of best-practice in the Ubuntu community, we can follow these steps to create an effective roadmap for each cycle: 1. Identify goals and objectives: Start by determining the key objectives for the team during the upcoming cycle. What are the main priorities and projects that need to be completed? Encourage input and collaboration from team members to ensure everyone's ideas are considered. 2. Assign tasks and responsibilities: Once you have a clear set of goals, break them down into smaller tasks and assign each task to a team member based on their skills, availability, and resources. This ensures that everyone knows what they are responsible for and helps to create a sense of accountability. 3. Set deadlines and milestones: Establish deadlines for each task and its associated milestones, which will help to keep the team on track and ensure that the project stays on schedule. Be realistic when setting deadlines, taking into account the size and complexity of the tasks, as well as each team member's availability. 4. Define success: Determine what success looks like for the team in the context of the roadmap. This may include specific outcomes, deliverables, or performance metrics that must be achieved by the end of the cycle. This ensures that everyone has a clear understanding of the team's goals and can work toward meeting them. 5. Communicate regularly: Establish a system for consistent communication among team members, which will help to keep everyone engaged and informed about progress, setbacks, and other important updates. Communication tools like email, messaging platforms, or project management software can be beneficial in facilitating these discussions. 6. Monitor and update the roadmap: Regularly review the roadmap to track progress, identify potential roadblocks, and make any necessary adjustments. This keeps the team aligned and helps to ensure that everyone is working effectively toward the completion of the project. 7. Celebrate success: Recognize and celebrate the team's accomplishments upon reaching milestones and completing the project. This helps to foster a sense of pride and motivation for future projects. By implementing a well-planned roadmap, teams within the Ubuntu community can better coordinate their efforts, work more effectively, and achieve greater success in their projects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They feel heavy pressure from their parents to do well in school. Most students are always being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have a wonderful life. Though this may be a good idea for those very smart students, it can have terrible results for many students because they are not talented enough. As it is reported, a number of students killed themselves. Others try to get the feelings of taking drugs . Some join the groups of troublemakers and turn to crime . Many of them have tried very hard at school but have failed in the exams and have their parents lose hopes. Such students felt that they are hated by everyone else they meet and they don't want to go to school any longer. It is surprising that though most Japanese parents are worried about their children, they do not help them in any ways .Many parents feel that they are not able to help their children and it is the teachers' work to help their children. To make matter worse, a lot of parents send their children to those school opening in the evenings and on weekends-- they only help students to pass exams and never teach students any real sense of the world. It is a great surprise that almost three quarters of middle school students have been to such kind of schools. Many Japanese schools usually have rules about everything from the students' hair to their clothes and the things in their bags. Child psychologists now think that such strict rules are harmful to the feelings of the students. Almost 40% of the students said that no one had taught them how to get on with others, how to tell right from wrong, how to show love for others, even for their parents.

Answer:","completion":"Yellowknife, the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, is situated on the northern shore of the Great Slave Lake. This large lake is the second-largest lake entirely within Canada's borders, the deepest in North America with a maximum depth of about 614 meters (2,014 feet), and the ninth-largest lake in the world by volume. Great Slave Lake is known for its irregular shape, which consists of four large arms: the North Arm, McLeod Bay, East Arm, and the South Arm. The lake exhibits a unique mix of deep, cold water and vast, shallow bays that foster a rich variety of habitats. Its waters are home to many types of fish, including walleye, inconnu, lake whitefish, lake trout, northern pike, and Arctic grayling. The lake also supports a significant commercial fishing industry, providing both income and food for communities in the region. Yellowknife, as the capital of Northwest Territories, is the largest city in a territory that is known for its sprawling wilderness and natural beauty. Founded in 1934, the city is named after the Dene First Nations people, the Yellowknives, who called the region their home. The city became the capital of the Northwest Territories in 1967, a role it has retained even after the creation of a separate territory, Nunavut, in 1999. The settlement of Yellowknife began as a gold mining town, and in more recent years has evolved into an important center of government and administration, as well as a hub for tourism and transportation. Major industries in Yellowknife today include mining, transport, and support services for remote communities. As a city situated near the Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife offers numerous recreational activities, such as fishing, boating, and canoeing during summers. During winters, with its location being close to the Arctic Circle, it offers a spectacular view of the stunning Northern Lights. The city's cultural scene reflects its diverse population, which includes Indigenous peoples, settlers from other parts of Canada, and newer arrivals from across the globe. Festivals such as the Long John Jamboree and the Snowking Winter Festival, engaging outdoor attractions like the Ingraham Trail and winter sports opportunities, all contribute to the city's vibrant community atmosphere. In summary, Yellowknife, the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, is located on the northern shore of the breathtaking Great Slave Lake. The city's history, natural beauty, and diverse community make it an important and distinctive part of Canada's far north."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Set the saucepan over medium heat. Heat the sugar mixture on the stove, stirring continuously, until the sugar granules dissolve and the mixture reaches a boil. This will usually take about 10 minutes. If the mixture reaches a boil but sugar crystals are still present on the side of the pan, cover the pan and continue boiling the syrup for 1 to 2 minutes. During this time, the steam should help wash the crystals away. Alternatively, you can wash down the sides of the pan by scraping them with a wet pastry brush. Continue cooking the syrup mixture over medium heat until your candy thermometer reads the ideal temperature. For soft nougat, the temperature should reach the soft ball stage and read 238 degrees Fahrenheit (114 degrees Celsius). For hard, chewy nougat, the temperature should reach the soft crack stage and read 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius). This will usually take anywhere from 6 to 12 more minutes.

It tells the story of a police officer who infiltrates a triad, and a police officer secretly working for the same gang. The Chinese title means \\"\\"The Unceasing Path\\"\\", a reference to Avici, the lowest level of Hell in Buddhism, where one endures suffering incessantly. The English title is a word play, combining the law enforcement term \\"internal affairs\\" typically the division of any law enforcement agency that would be responsible for (among other things) finding a mole with the adjective \\"infernal\\", meant in this case as a reference not to fires or infernos in general, but specifically to the inferno of Hell (\\"Inferno\\" being the Italian word for \\"Hell\\"). Thus, the English title is both a phonetic pun and like the Chinese title an allusion to a place or condition of eternal suffering. \\"Infernal Affairs\\" is the first in the Infernal Affairs series and was followed by \\"Infernal Affairs II\\" and \\"Infernal Affairs III\\". - John Chong Ching is a Hong Kong film producer and presenter .

The Fox Indians were living in eastern Wisconsin at the time of their first contacts with the French around 1670.:218 The Fox unsuccessfully sought to establish themselves as middlemen between the French and the Sioux, one of their two traditional enemies, the other being the Ojibwas in northern Wisconsin.:218 Not only were the Fox unsuccessful, but prior to 1701, many wars between aboriginal people, which also included the French, against the Iroquois were ravaging the aboriginal lands of the Pays d'en Haut. The Iroquoian wars brought fear and urgency for the French to attempt to save what was left of their trade alliances.:143 Their alliances were in jeopardy, and also, in 1697 the western posts were closed as a result of the termination by Louis XIV of the fur trade west of Montreal.:218 Historian Richard White illustrates central Wisconsin at the end of the seventeenth century as \\"a vast refugee center, its situation constantly changing, nations socializing, cooperating, feuding, fighting, constantly adjusting their strategies to shift in French trading policy, which was always the dominant reality.\\":52 Thus, when the Peace Conference of 1701 finally took place in Montreal, the French were quick to establish a French protectorate in the Great Lakes region.:97 Nevertheless, the question still remained as to how they would facilitate trade with their southern partners, when their main trading posts had been closed.

Her husband Frank (Jean Sorel) is a lawyer working for Brighton's practice. They all live together in a large apartment with Joan (Edy Gall), Frank's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams she's been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet excite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies. During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst. Carol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? excellent companion piece","completion":"The phrase \\"excellent companion piece\\" can be predominantly considered positive. In this detailed answer, we will break down its components and analyze its meaning and context to establish why it has a positive connotation. 1. \\"Excellent\\": The first word, \\"excellent,\\" is an adjective that describes something as being of the highest quality or being extremely good. The word signifies an object or situation which surpasses just being good, and instead stands in the realm of exceptionally good. Therefore, the use of \\"excellent\\" adds a strong positive connotation to the phrase. 2. \\"Companion\\": The word \\"companion\\" generally refers to a person, thing, or entity that accompanies, goes hand-in-hand, or harmonizes with another. It often has positive connotations as well, as a good companion is described as being supportive, compatible, and helpful. In the context of this phrase, \\"companion\\" suggests that the subject being referenced complements or enhances another primary piece or work. 3. \\"Piece\\": In this context, \\"piece\\" refers to a work of art, literature, music, or any other creative material. It's a neutral term that carries no inherent positive or negative connotations. The term simply denotes the object or creation being discussed. When combined, \\"excellent companion piece\\" refers to a work that is of high quality and serves as a fitting and enhancing supplement or accompaniment to another primary work. It implies that the creator of the companion piece has done an exceptional job in complementing, improving, or providing additional depth to the other work. This can be evident in various forms of media such as films, books, artworks, and even academic works. For example, if someone discusses a documentary as an \\"excellent companion piece\\" to a book on the same subject, it means that the documentary provides insightful and valuable content that goes well with the book. It could offer a different perspective, additional information, or provide a new context for readers, ultimately adding a richer experience for those engaged with the primary work. In conclusion, \\"excellent companion piece\\" is considered a positive phrase as it emphasizes the high quality, compatibility, and supportive nature of the work it describes. Its use indicates that the piece adds value, depth, and a harmonious connection to another primary work, which enriches the overall experience for the audience or reader."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees?, using the article: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets.

He carefully balanced it on top of his other groceries, hoping to make it home without any accidents. Step 1: Analyze the situation Before continuing, it is essential to understand the context of the story and the character's current predicament. Step 2: Build tension To engage the reader in the story, the protagonist should encounter some complications or obstacles. As Bob walked down the sidewalk, the egg carton teetered precariously on top of his groceries. He knew one wrong move could send the eggs crashing to the ground. Step 3: Introduce a new character or event Introducing new elements can help extend the story and add additional dimensions to the plot. Just then, a neighbor's dog bounded over, excited to see Bob. The dog jumped up, knocking into the egg carton as Bob tried to swerve out of the way. Step 4: Further the protagonist's struggle To make the story more interesting, the main character should need to overcome challenges or setbacks. Bob managed to catch the egg carton in mid-air, but the sudden movement caused him to drop one of his shopping bags. Canned goods rolled out onto the pavement, drawing the attention of passersby. Step 5: Show growth or learning If the character learns from their experiences or setbacks, it can make for a more gratifying story. Slightly embarrassed, Bob took a moment to reassess his situation. He realized he had been careless in trying to carry everything at once. Determined not to make the same mistake again, he made a plan. Step 6: Implement a solution The protagonist should attempt to solve their problem, offering the reader a sense of progress. He put the egg carton in the now-empty shopping bag and then placed the canned goods around it. This way, the bag provided a protective barrier for the delicate eggs. Step 7: Resolution and reflection A resolution helps to tie up the story, while offering the reader an opportunity to reflect on the events and lessons learned. Carefully balancing the improved arrangement, Bob made his way home without further incident, grateful for the lesson he had learned. From then on, he vowed to be more mindful of the way he carried his groceries.

It is now day 22 and with only two days left of feasting, the creeper must find new victims before his time is up. The bat-like creeper has greater strength with his ability to fly. The story begins with the creeper as a scarecrow in a cornfield waiting to snatch the child of Jack Taggart (Ray Wise) who ends up wanting revenge on the creeper after he flies away with his son. This leads to the 23rd and last day of the creeper. A busload of high school basketball players, cheerleaders, and coaches are returning home after a Championship game on East 9 Highway. The creeper throws a spike made from the body parts of other victims and blows out one of the bus tires. As night falls, the creeper swoops down and takes the coaches away, and then he begins to feast on the terrified teenagers. This is the creeper's last night and he loves the smell of fear on his victims. One girl fights back and puts a javelin stick through the creeper's eye and head, but it doesn't kill him.

A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

Q:I have a new situation: A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents. Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo. But I can use this background: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes. What is an answer for this question: Which markalong was produced asexually? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the information provided step-by-step: 1. A species of animal called a markalong can reproduce either sexually or asexually. 2. Animal A has only one parent, while Animal B has two parents. As mentioned in the provided background information, asexual reproduction involves only one parent, while sexual reproduction involves the mixing of traits from two parents.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). Now, I have a new situation: Gill and Ann were two fellow botanists.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are connected through an important relationship. This relationship enables life to survive as we know it. The products of one process are the reactants of the other. Notice that the equation for cellular respiration is the direct opposite of photosynthesis :. Choices: - glycolysis - atherosclerosis - absorption - photosynthesis A: A:","completion":"Photosynthesis acts as a natural complement for cellular respiration. Both processes play crucial roles in the sustenance of life, particularly for plants and animals, as they make up the basis of energy transformation throughout ecosystems. The two processes are connected through a significant relationship in which the products of one serve as the reactants for the other. Photosynthesis, primarily occurring in plants, algae, and some bacteria, is the process by which light energy is absorbed and converted into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other organic compounds. This process also consumes carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), while releasing oxygen (O2) into the atmosphere as a byproduct. The general equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 On the other hand, cellular respiration is the process by which organisms, including both plants and animals, break down glucose and other organic compounds to release stored energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide and water as waste products. The general equation for cellular respiration is the reverse of that for photosynthesis: C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP (energy) Therefore, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary processes because they rely on each other to function.

The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with about 350,000 species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (angeion-, \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and sperma, \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.

Movie title: Bamboozled Movie plot: Pierre Delacroix (whose real name is Peerless Dothan), is an uptight, Harvard University-educated black man, working for the television network CNS. At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE, and use the word \\"nigger\\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \\"Cosby clones\\". In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to bring the show down...

In this sentence, the main subject is Varshamov, and it starts by stating that he was \\"with Arnold Walfisz.\\" The parenthetical phrase \\"where he studied Georgian\\" clarifies some additional details about Varshamov's activities while in Tbilisi.

Article:Mr Trump has described the agreement - implemented a year ago - as \\"the worst deal ever\\" and threatened to scrap it. But Hassan Rouhani said the comments were just \\"slogans\\" and that there was no chance of any renegotiation. Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its sensitive nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. Outgoing US President Barack Obama says the deal will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy - and stresses that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. During the US presidential election campaign last March, Mr Trump told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that his \\"number-one priority\\" would be \\"to dismantle the disastrous deal\\". He said his biggest concern was not that Iran would violate the agreement, but that it could \\"keep the terms and get to the bomb by simply running out the clock\\". At a news conference marking the first anniversary of the lifting of sanctions on Tuesday, Iran's president was asked about Mr Trump's comments. \\"The respected president-elect has so far expressed the opinion that he is unhappy about it [the deal], or that it is not a good deal, or the worst deal ever,\\" he answered. \\"These are all slogans and I deem it unlikely that he would act on it once he enters the White House. Since this is not a bilateral agreement, it is not up to him to say whether he likes it or dislikes it.\\" Mr Rouhani went on to stress that \\"any renegotiation\\" was \\"out of the question\\". On Monday, Mr Obama issued a statement saying the deal had \\"achieved significant, concrete results in making the United States and the world a safer place\\" by rolling back Iran's nuclear programme and \\"verifiably\\" preventing it from developing a nuclear weapon. He noted that Iran had reduced its uranium stockpile by 98% and removed two thirds of its centrifuges, which are needed to separate out the fissile isotope U-235 from uranium hexafluoride gas. Low-enriched uranium, which has a 3%-4% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. But it can also be enriched to the 90% needed to produce nuclear weapons. Iran was also not enriching any uranium at the underground Fordo facility, nor using advanced centrifuges to enrich, according to Mr Obama. In an apparent warning to Mr Trump, he said: \\"The Iran deal must be measured against the alternatives. A diplomatic resolution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is far preferable to an unconstrained Iranian nuclear programme or another war in the Middle East.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"President-elect Donald Trump has previously described the Iran nuclear deal as \\"the worst deal ever\\" and threatened to scrap it.

Supporting Fact 2: Charon is about half the size of Pluto, making it the largest satellite in the solar system relative to the size of the planet it orbits. This distinct ratio led scientists to classify Pluto and Charon as a \\"dwarf planet and moon system\\" or a \\"binary (dwarf) planet.\\" Supporting Fact 3: Charon and Pluto are tidally locked with each other, meaning that they always show the same face to each other as they rotate. This unique characteristic implies that they share a common center of mass, further solidifying the concept of a binary (dwarf) planet system. Supporting Fact 4: Charon's surface is primarily composed of water ice, with evidence of ammonia hydrates and other organic compounds possibly present. This information suggests that both Pluto and its moon have similar origins, possibly interacting early in their formation and evolving together. Supporting Fact 5: Observations from NASA's New Horizons mission in 2015 provided a wealth of information about Pluto and Charon, including detailed images of their surfaces, composition, and atmosphere. These valuable insights have significantly improved our understanding of these celestial bodies and their interwoven relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There were a test in the US. People of different ages, from 12 to 83, took the test. During the test, these people got all kinds of breakfasts and sometimes they got no breakfast at all. Scientists wanted to see how well they worked after they ate different kinds of breakfasts. The result shows that if a person eats a right breakfast , he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast. If a student has fruit, eggs, bread and milk before going to school, he will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class. The result is different from what some people think. It shows having no breakfast will not help them lose weight. This is because they become so hungry at noon that they eat too much for lunch. In fact, they will gain weight.

Ethnic Russians constitute 25.5% of the country's current population and 58.6% of the native Estonian population is also able to speak Russian. In all, 67.8% of Estonia's population can speak Russian. Command of Russian language, however, is rapidly decreasing among younger Estonians (primarily being replaced by the command of English). For example, if 53% of ethnic Estonians between 15 and 19 claim to speak some Russian, then among the 10- to 14-year-old group, command of Russian has fallen to 19% (which is about one-third the percentage of those who claim to have command of English in the same age group). What is the ratio of young Estonians who speak Russian relative to those who speak English? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Imagine we have 100 young Estonians in the age group of 10-14 years old. Out of these 100 kids, 19 of them can speak Russian, and the question says that this is one-third the number of those who can speak English. So, if we want to find out how many of them can speak English, we can do some simple math like this: 1 \\"part\\" for the Russian speakers = 19 kids 3 \\"parts\\" for the English speakers (because English speakers are 3 times more than Russian speakers) Now we multiply 19 (the 1 \\"part\\" for Russian speakers) by 3 to find out how many kids speak English: 19 kids (Russian speakers) x 3 = 57 kids (English speakers) So, in this group of 100 young Estonians, 19 of them can speak Russian, and 57 of them can speak English. The ratio of young Estonians who speak Russian to those who speak English is 19:57."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Based on the Doppler effect, the electromagnetic waves reaching Earth from a galaxy that is moving away from Earth would be expected to Available choices: - experience an increase in their amplitude.. - experience an increase in frequency.. - experience a decrease from transverse waves to longitudinal waves.. - experience a decrease in frequency.. Answer:","completion":"The answer is: experience a decrease in frequency. Explanation: The Doppler effect is what happens when something, like a galaxy, is moving away from us. Imagine you and I playing catch with a ball. If we move closer, the ball comes to me faster and the time between catches is shorter. If we move away, the ball takes longer to reach me, and the time between catches is longer. With the galaxy, instead of a ball, we have electromagnetic waves (like light). As the galaxy moves away from Earth, the waves take longer to reach us. This means that the frequency, which is how often the waves come, decreases. So, the waves have a lower frequency when a galaxy is moving away from us."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. St. Bernard dogs are no longer used for Alpine rescues, the last recorded instance of which was in 1955. As late as 2004, the Great St Bernard Hospice still retained 18 of the dogs for reasons of tradition and sentiment. In that year the Barry Foundation created breeding kennels for the breed at the town of Martigny down the Great Saint Bernard Pass, and purchased the remaining dogs from the Hospice. During the summer months each year a number of the animals are temporarily relocated from Martigny to the Hospice for viewing by tourists. Can we conclude that are st bernards still used as rescue dogs?","completion":"Well, little buddy, imagine you have a toy car that was your favorite, but now you love playing with your new superhero action figures instead. You still keep your toy car because you love it and it reminds you of wonderful play times you had earlier. This is similar to the situation with St. Bernard dogs. In the past, St. Bernard dogs were used to rescue people in the mountains, like real-life superheroes. But now, they don't do that job anymore. The last time a St. Bernard dog did a rescue was a long time ago, in 1955, before your parents were even born! Yet, people at a place called the Great St Bernard Hospice kept 18 St. Bernard dogs till 2004 because they liked them and wanted to preserve the tradition, just like you keep your toy car. Then, these dogs were moved to a place called the Barry Foundation in Martigny, where they take care of them, breed them, and keep the tradition alive. During the summer, some of these dogs are taken back to the Hospice so that people visiting there can see them, kind of like a summer camp.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Observe the cat for a few days. This way, you can determine its nature, especially when humans come close. Is the cat afraid or scared of people? Is it angry? If you think they may be dangerous you shouldn't try handling them. Instead, call animal control or a human society who will be able to professionally capture and handle the cat if you think they pose a danger. Cats communicate their feelings with body language that can be rather obvious. For example: An angry or upset cat will have ears that are flattened back, dilated pupils, a tail which is switching back and forth, an arched back, and fur standing on end. The cat will typically be growling. This is a sign to back off. If it hasn't run away, a scared cat will typically lay flat or have its tail between its legs. Proceed with caution in trying to tame these cats. In contrast, a contented and relaxed cat's ears will be forward and alert, and its tail will be straight up in the air. Its fur will be flat (not standing on end), and the cat may even stretch, lay down, and roll onto its back. While you will not be close to the cat, you will be able to observe its overall health from afar. Check to see if it looks skinny or bony. It may be hungry. Look at its fur to see if it looks healthy, or if it looks matted, patchy, bald, or otherwise unhealthy. See if the cat has any other obvious issues, such as limping, cuts, sores, or other problems. Feral cats and kittens are generally unvaccinated and carry a slight risk for carrying the deadly rabies virus. While very uncommon, rabies in cats can occur primarily in outdoor, unvaccinated cats and kittens. The symptoms of rabies can vary and may take months to develop after a cat or kitten was exposed to the virus. Classic signs of rabies in cats and kittens include an ill cat (lethargic, not eating, weakness) and/or changes in behavior (aggressive, restless, disoriented, paralysis, seizures). If you encounter a feral cat with these symptoms, call animal control and do not attempt to handle the cat or kitten. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, when observing a cat to determine its nature, pay close attention to its body language and physical condition. Look for signs of fear or aggression, such as flattened ears, arched back, or growling, and proceed with caution if attempting to approach the cat. Also, assess its overall health by checking for a healthy appearance or any signs of injury or illness. Be aware of the risk of rabies in unvaccinated feral cats and kittens and look for symptoms, such as lethargy, aggression, or disorientation.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What system pairs the eight songs off against each other? Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (deltävlingar) in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show. Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen. Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004. The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005. In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The...

The BF and I went in here last night to get the summer sampler, and we were excited to try this new place for less money. Well what we paid was STILL too much for what we got. We ordered the caprese salad, a pizza with pepperoni and arugula, and two glasses of chardonnay. The caprese salad was not what was expected. Usually it's just basil, tomato, mozz, balsamic, and evoo. This was a salad (like lettuce) with hidden chunks of mozz and tomato in it, as well as some soggy pieces of bread. The mozz was the most flavorless mozz cheese I have had in a long time.... not so good. Otherwise, the salad was a plain old salad, but not what I wanted when I ordered it.... oh well. The pizza came out ridiculously fast. This leads me to believe that they are all sitting back there made and waiting to be shoved in the oven real quick and brought out. Our pizza had some spots that were covered in black burnt crust and some that seemed like they'd barely been in an oven (droopy, chewy, meh tasting). The pizza also lacked a lot of flavor, the sauce was almost non existent in taste, and it could have been a frozen pizza for how it tasted. The wine we got was also not pleasant.... although, chardonnay is not my usual wine, I have had it and this was particularly bad.

Question: Whom does Raj starts to like? Movie title: Mujhse Dosti Karoge! Movie plot: Raj Khanna (Hrithik Roshan), Pooja Sahani (Rani Mukherjee) and Tina Kapoor (Kareena Kapoor) are childhood friends. While Raj has always been attracted to the vivacious and beautiful Tina, he is completely unaware of the quiet Pooja's love for him. Raj's father (Kiran Kumar) decides to move to England with his family to take up a new job. Before leaving, Raj makes Tina promise to write to him via e-mail. But Tina soon becomes occupied with other things, so it's the loyal Pooja who writes to Raj with Tina's name to help Tina keep her promise. Raj and Pooja have many things in common, and their e-mails bring them close to each other. A decade and a half later, Raj returns to India for a short vacation. By now, he's in love with the girl he has been writing to, and believes he can recognize her at first sight. When the three of them finally meet, Raj, to Pooja's disappointment, completely ignores her and is besotted with Tina, who is as vivacious as ever. However, during the two weeks of his vacation, he cannot help but notice that the real Tina is completely different from the Tina he knew from the e-mails.

The White House said Monday that President Donald Trump \\"doesn't believe any of these accusations\\" made by adult film actress Stormy Daniels that she had a one-night affair with the future U.S. leader in 2006 and five years later was threatened to keep quiet about their alleged liaison. Trump spokesman Raj Shah rejected any suggestion that Trump had engaged in wrongdoing because his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star 130,000 from his own funds in hush money shortly before the 2016 presidential election. \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" said Shah, who faced a barrage of questions from reporters after a lengthy Daniels interview aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes, a CBS News show that drew its biggest ratings in a decade for the spectacle. \\"He's consistently denied these accusations,\\" Shah said of Trump. The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \\"inconsistent\\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Shah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her. \\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \\" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \\"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\\" Trump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy. Daniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine. She said the incident made her fearful for years and that she thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted 130,000 from Trump...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: A little girl seems pretty bored while her male friend is having a lot of fun with toy tea set. Hypothesis: The little girl is sitting cross legged. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Given the premise provided, we cannot directly conclude that the little girl is sitting cross-legged, as there is no explicit information given about her posture or position. To deduce a conclusion about her posture, we need to incorporate context clues, observations, and reasoning based on the information we have at hand. Firstly, let's analyze the available information: 1. A little girl seems pretty bored: This statement informs us about the girl's emotional state, but it doesn't provide direct information about her physical posture. 2. A male friend is having a lot of fun with the toy tea set: This statement informs us about the male friend's activity and emotional state; however, it doesn't give clear information about the girl's posture. To attempt to make a reasonable conclusion regarding the girl's posture (specifically, if she's sitting cross-legged or not), we have to consider typical behaviors and settings where children might play with a toy tea set. In many cases, children may sit on the floor (indoors or outdoors) to engage with such an activity. Sitting cross-legged is a common posture when sitting on the floor, particularly for young children who find it comfortable and easy. Although this analysis raises the possibility that she might be sitting cross-legged as it is a common posture in such a situation, it is still not a definitive conclusion. There are various other ways a little girl could be sitting or standing while feeling bored around her friend who is playing with a toy tea set. For instance, she could also be sitting with her legs stretched out or standing beside him with folded arms. In conclusion, given the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the little girl is sitting cross-legged. However, based on context and typical behaviors, it is a plausible hypothesis, but more information would be needed to confirm her posture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes or no? Answer: It does not result in sequestration of the carbon dioxide but the gas is recycled as much as possible. Question: what is fuel oil used for A:","completion":"No, the provided answer does not directly address the question about fuel oil usage. Fuel oil, also known as residual oil or heavy oil, is a byproduct of crude oil refining. It is a viscous liquid that has several uses: 1. Heating: Fuel oil is primarily used in furnaces and boilers to generate heat in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. It serves as a reliable and efficient fuel source for centralized heating systems. 2. Power generation: Fuel oil is used as a fuel source for power generation, particularly in areas with limited access to natural gas or other energy resources. Fuel oil-fired power plants convert the heat released from the combustion of fuel oil into electricity. 3. Marine fuel: Known as bunker oil, fuel oil is used to power large vessels such as cargo ships and ocean liners. It is a popular choice in marine transportation due to its energy density and low cost. 4. Industrial processes: Some industrial processes require the high heat output that fuel oil can provide, such as in cement production and steel manufacturing.

The more they learn about pet food, the better able they will be to make an informed decision that will keep their pet healthier and safer.\\" Here are several tips that consumers may want to keep in mind when it comes to choosing a pet food that will help reduce the risks. Get to know the company. Most people may know a company name simply because they spend millions on advertising. But that doesn't mean they know much about the company or their morals. Research companies to find one that offers high standards, quality products, and great customer service. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to get in touch with a pet food company and ask them where something was made, where ingredients came from, or any other questions. They should have no problem answering questions about their products, or with being able to provide proof of their quality standards. Read reviews. Do some searches to read some reviews about various brands of pet food. Keep in mind that some reviews can be one-sided and even planted by the company itself, so look for fair third-party sources giving the review. Investigate ingredients. The source of ingredients is of major concern when it comes to reducing the risks of pet food recalls and keeping pets healthy. Read the labels and ask questions to determine where the ingredients are coming from. Understand pet foods. Cat and dog food should contain 100 percent protein, which will supply them with the nutrients their bodies require. The problem with many commercial pet foods is that it is full of numerous fillers, such as cheap fillers and grains.

A First World War bomb killed two construction site workers when it exploded 100 years after being fired at a Belgian battlefield. The bomb had laid dormant for a century at an industrial site in the former area of Flanders battlegrounds, killing two and injuring two more. Johan Lescrauwaert of the Ypres prosecutor's office confirmed that the armament from the 1914-1918 war exploded near the workers, but did not say whether it was a shell or a grenade. Emergency personnel remove evidence near a covered body after a World War One armament exploded in Ypres, Belgium. It was not confirmed whether the bomb was a grenade or a shell, but it has been confirmed that it killed two and injured two more. The circumstances were unclear because there was apparently no digging at the site - the usual cause of such accidents. Every year the battlefields in western Belgium throw up hundreds of armaments from the Great War, and most are destroyed without incident by a special Belgian army bomb squad. In a nearby city, the army was completing the destruction of over 800 gas canisters. More and more unexploded shells are discovered every year in the areas in and around the former Flanders field battleground. Evacuation works are the common cause of exploding the dormant shells, as the heavy machinery used in the process can jostle the delicate armaments back to life, although this case was peculiar because no digging took place. The Flanders battlefields cover dozens of cities where allies clashed with German forces for most of the war. Earlier this year, members of the bomb disposal unit managed to disarm an unexploded shell at a construction site in Ypres, Northwestern Belgium. Also earlier this month, a large amount of ammunition from the First World War was discovered on the border of the West Flemish municipalities of Passchendaele and Moorslede, for which the Belgian bomb squad is still working to clean up the site. Earlier this month members of the bomb disposal unit in Ypres, Belgium, were lucky as they managed to evacuate and disarm a WWI-era bomb before it exploded. The unexploded bomb from January 2014 was found during similar evacuation works to the ones that caused a bomb to explode this month. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

The game can be played for free, but nearly all in-game activities require personal resources that you have available to use.Although there are various activities to keep you busy on Calypso, what most people do first is to find themselves a profession, such as hunting the fierce animals on Calypso, mining the precious minerals and making tools.Then they can think about buying their virtual house or paying a visit to a virtual nightclub or doing any of the other activities that make life bearable. Entropia has its very own economy and its own currency, the PED (Project Entropia Dollars).Players move real world money into PED which they then use to pay for their life on Calypso.However, the virtual things inside Entropia do have a real value in the outside world, and careful business deals mean that players can actually make real money there.PED can be changed into dollars any time at a rate of 10PED to 1US.

Question: Question: \\"Where would you expect to find most glaciers on earth?\\" Context: \\"On Earth, 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in the polar regions, but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent except Australia, and on a few high-latitude oceanic islands. Between 35°N and 35°S, glaciers occur only in the Himalayas, Andes, Rocky Mountains, a few high mountains in East Africa, Mexico, New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran. Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth's land surface. Continental glaciers cover nearly 13,000,000 km2 (5×10^6 sq mi) or about 98 percent of Antarctica's 13,200,000 km2 (5.1×10^6 sq mi), with an average thickness of 2,100 m (7,000 ft). Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of continental glaciers.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided context, the majority of glaciers on Earth are found within the polar regions, which contain approximately 99% of all glacial ice. These extensive ice sheets are primarily located in Antarctica and Greenland. Antarctica is by far the most abundant in its glacial presence, with nearly 13,000,000 square kilometers of ice, representing about 98% of its total land surface. The average thickness of these massive continental glaciers is around 2,100 meters. Apart from that, the region also experiences extreme temperature which makes it ideal for the formation and preservation of these giant ice bodies. Greenland, while not as extensive as Antarctica, is known for its significant glacial expanses. Like Antarctica, the environmental conditions of Greenland, with its constant low temperatures, make it conducive to glacier development and maintenance, producing some of the biggest glaciers outside of Antarctica. In addition to these polar regions, glaciers can also be found in mountainous zones across the different continents, except Australia. These mountains provide the required altitude, low temperature and adequate precipitation, conditions necessary for the formation and survival of glaciers. Among these, the main clusters of glaciers between 35°N and 35°S latitude can be spotted in the Himalayas, Andes, and Rocky Mountains. Also, a few high-altitude locations within East Africa, Mexico, New Guinea, and Iran (Zard Kuh) host glaciers. Finally, a few oceanic islands present at high latitudes also house glaciers. These islands primarily lie within the polar circles. In total, glaciers cover about 10% of Earth's land surface, with continental glaciers covering large areas like Antarctica and Greenland. Despite their substantial concentration in these regions, we can expect to find glaciers in surprisingly diverse locations across the globe, from the equator-reaching heights of the Himalayas and Andes to the remote cold of polar oceanic islands."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: This movie is about sexual obsession. Bette Davis plays Mildred. This is a woman who men are drawn to. Not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity. Now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious. There is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her. She works as a waitress in a coffee shop, she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt. It is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her. One day Phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her. He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. Meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it. He dreams about her like she is a angel, but she is no angel. He is constantly thinking about her. His med school grades are even failing. So what the nookie is too good. He wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy. She always lets Phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time. He is heart broken but he meets another woman. They seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the Bimbo. Mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed. Phillip takes her in again, but she starts going out with a friend of his, the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out. She does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him, well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up. Oh we have a club foot that he has problems about, even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it. He meets another girl named Sally we have a March of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for Mildred. Well he has no school tuition, can't find a job. Finally Sally and her dad takes him in. Not before another March of Time montage showing him going downhill. Soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor. Meanwhile he finds Mildred needs him again. She has TB. meanwhile he is still leading Sally down the Primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship. Finally the bimbo dies and Phillip declares he is free now and he will marry Sally. I wished she told him to stuff it. Now I know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points. But I feel Phillip was the bad guy. Yes Mildred is a Strumpet BUT he knows it, and he keeps coming back. Mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers. I guess the sex wasn't as good. But in any case he dogs those women waiting for Mildred. Not only that but the man who gets Mildred pregnant is already married and when Philip asks him what he intends to do about Baby ( apparently the baby's name) he laughs is off, he has no intention in supporting her and Baby and he is wealthy. Sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist. Philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either. Men are using Mildred as a Boy Toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed. Yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain. To me it is Philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for Mildred.","completion":"This story is about a movie where a woman named Mildred is not very nice or pretty, but she is very good at getting men to like her because she flirts a lot.

He even starts doing bad in school because he can't stop thinking about her. Phillip meets another girl but still thinks about Mildred. Later, Mildred comes back and needs Phillip's help, but he finally realizes that she's not a good person. In the end, Mildred gets sick and passes away, and Phillip says he's free now and wants to marry the other girl.

Please answer the following question: - Bread absorbs water from the air - Bread absorbs warmth from the air - Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread - Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy - Mold colonies grow until they are visible. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The first step of the process is bread absorbing water from the air. To provide a detailed explanation of the mold growth process on bread, let's break down each step: 1. Bread absorbs water from the air: The process begins with bread absorbing moisture present in the surrounding air. Bread contains water-soluble starches and sugars which makes it hygroscopic, meaning it can easily absorb water molecules from the air. The environment's relative humidity plays a significant role in this process. Higher humidity allows bread to absorb more moisture, consequently helping to create favorable conditions for mold growth. 2. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: Apart from moisture, warmth is another crucial factor that contributes to mold growth on bread. Most mold species thrive in temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (approximately 21°C to 32°C). However, some species can grow at lower or higher temperatures. Bread can absorb warmth from the surrounding air, which in turn accelerates mold growth. 3. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: Mold spores are microscopic fungi particles that are present in the air. They can easily be transported by air currents or even a slight breeze, settling on various surfaces, including bread. Dust particles often carry these mold spores and can introduce them to the bread's surface. 4. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: Once the mold spores are in contact with the moist and warm bread, they can begin to grow and multiply. They release enzymes that break down the bread's carbohydrates, sugars, and proteins into simpler compounds, which the mold uses for energy and growth. This process causes the bread to become spoiled and inedible. 5. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: As the mold consumes nutrients from the bread and multiplies, it forms visible colonies on the bread's surface. These colonies can appear in different colors and textures, depending on the mold species. Some common mold colors include green, black, white, and blue. Preventing mold growth on bread involves limiting the factors that contribute to its development, such as reducing exposure to humidity and warmth, and keeping the bread in a clean and protected environment. Storing bread in airtight containers or refrigerating it can help maintain its freshness and delay the onset of mold growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's analyze the function of these important words in the sentence: 1. Pizza: This is the primary subject, around which the sentence is built and aims to provide information. By mentioning \\"pizza,\\" we know that the sentence is describing a specific type of food and sets the context for understanding the variety and ingredients that follow. 2. Cheese: As an ingredient, \\"cheese\\" serves to give the reader a clearer understanding of the type of pizza being described. Cheese is an essential and foundational pizza topping, providing both flavor and texture. As a widely popular pizza ingredient, its mention in this sentence contributes to an increased comprehensibility of the pizza's characteristics. 3. Onions: \\"Onions\\" is another crucial ingredient mentioned in the sentence. Adding onions to a pizza introduces a distinct flavor profile that may sway one's preference towards or away from this particular variety. As a recognizable and often-used pizza topping, it plays an essential role in further illustrating the specific nature of the pizza being described. 4. Hot peppers: The last key ingredient listed, \\"hot peppers\\" denotes the spice level and potentially the predominant flavor element of this pizza. Hot peppers can bring about a significant taste distinction, causing this pizza to vary notably from other options. As a deciding factor for many people when choosing their preferred pizza toppings, hot peppers' mention in this sentence amplifies the necessary details for understanding the pizza's composition. In conclusion, the important words in the sentence, \\"A pizza with cheese, onions, and hot peppers\\" - pizza, cheese, onions, and hot peppers - work cohesively to convey the central theme and provide a comprehensive picture of the specific kind of pizza being described.

They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days.

Article: Show was seen as a barometer for free speech in Egypt, but Youssef claims he is no longer safe to work The television satirist seen as the barometer for free speech in post-revolutionary Egypt, Bassem Youssef, has ended his show because he feels it is no longer safe to satirise Egyptian politics. \\"The present climate in Egypt is not suitable for a political satire program,\\" the former surgeon told reporters in a press conference at his studio on Monday afternoon. \\"I'm tired of struggling and worrying about my safety and that of my family.\\" Youssef's announcement followed a decision by his host channel, MBC-Misr, to suspend his show during Egypt's recent presidential election campaign – in what was perceived as an attempt to stop him mocking Egypt's incoming head of state, field marshal Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. The suspension was Youssef's second in less than a year. In September, his previous employers, CBC, terminated an earlier incarnation of the show after he lightly criticised supporters of Egypt's government – and on Monday Youssef said he and his team lacked the stamina to move to a third channel. The announcement marks a sharp reversal in fortunes for a man who was once the poster-boy for Egypt's post-revolutionary gains. Following the fall of Hosni Mubarak, he took advantage of the freer political climate to post homemade satire shows on YouTube. He came from obscurity to first earn millions of YouTube hits, and then later his own slick TV show – the first of its kind to feature a live audience in Egypt. He became known outside the country as Egypt's Jon Stewart, after the American comedian whom Youssef aimed to emulate. But he first ran into trouble during the tenure of the now-ousted Mohamed Morsi, whose prosecutor-general investigated him for insulting the president. Matters turned worse after Sisi ousted Morsi last July, and the country was swept by a wave of nationalism that left little space for government critics – including, as of Monday, Youssef himself. At his farewell speech, Youssef did not specify exactly who had pressured his employers to end his show. But in a recent interview with the Guardian's Sunday sister paper, Youssef made it clear that Egypt's military-backed government had created an environment in which censorship was possible. \\"You can always implement some sort of a mood, without actually giving direct orders,\\" Youssef said at the time. \\"It is about creating a certain atmosphere that would make this acceptable or doable, and I think it reflects badly on everybody. Even if the people in authority do not do it, it reflects badly on the freedom of speech in Egypt.\\" ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption The satirist posed with his writers and producers as he announced the show would end after almost three years One of Egypt's most popular TV satire shows has come to an end, its creator Bassem Youssef has announced. The satirist said he was \\"tired of struggling\\" and worried about the safety of his family. His \\"al-Bernameg\\" (The Programme) show came under pressure after poking fun at Egypt's military establishment. The show has been sued dozens of times since it began in the wake of ex-President Hosni Mubarak's downfall in 2011. Mr Youssef, a former heart surgeon, told a news conference on Monday that the channel that carried the show had been pressured to drop it. \`The present climate in Egypt is not suitable for a political satire programme,\\" he added. He denied that he was capitulating to pressure, saying: \\"Stopping the programme sends a much stronger message than if it continued.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The show is inspired by US satirist Jon Stewart, who appeared on the programme last year At its height, the show was watched by an estimated 8 million viewers inside Egypt and many millions more abroad. Household name The show began as a series of amateur YouTube clips filmed in Mr Youssef's Cairo flat in the days following Egypt's 2011 revolution. Inspired by Jon Stewart's Daily Show, Bassem Youssef went on to develop al-Bernameg, a satirical show filmed in front of a studio audience. Its success made him a household name throughout the Arab world and he was named as one of the world's top 100 most influential people by Time Magazine in 2013. However, the show's sharp satire repeatedly angered the authorities, who tried to close it down. Under the presidency of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi, Mr Youssef faced charges of insulting Islam. The charges were later thrown out of court, shortly after which Mr Morsi was too thrown out of office by Egypt's military. In November the private Egyptian CBC channel refused to broadcast one episode because it had \\"violated editorial policy\\". Image copyright AP Image caption A heart surgeon by training, Mr Youssef became one of Egypt's best known and controversial satirists The decision came days after Mr Youssef had lampooned the then head of the army, General Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi, over chocolates that bore his name. In February, prosecutors filed fresh complaints, accusing Mr Youssef of insulting the armed forces, the will of the Egyptian people and the \\"symbols\\" of Egypt. The show had been on temporary hiatus during Egypt's presidential election, which Mr Sisi won by an overwhelming margin. Before its cancellation, the show had been due to return later this week. ||||| Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Freedom Awards after accepting an award in New York City, on November 26, 2013. Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists'... Read More Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef speaks at the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Freedom Awards after accepting an award in New York City, on November 26, 2013. Close Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef said his popular political satire show won’t return to Egyptian television screens, amid a crackdown on media as former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi prepares to take over the presidency. Youssef, known as Egypt’s Jon Stewart, said at a Cairo press conference that the Saudi-owned channel MBC, which has been broadcasting his show, has come under pressure to take it off the air. Youssef said the program won’t be shown on another channel because of “the atmosphere surrounding the media,” the state-run Ahram Gate website reported. El-Sisi, who won a landslide victory in last week’s presidential election, has presided over restrictions on media since he led the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in July last year. Journalists from the Qatar-based news channel Al-Jazeera are being prosecuted on terrorism-related charges. Human Rights Watch said in February, when the Jazeera trial began, that it showed “how fast the space for dissent in Egypt is evaporating.” Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood were among the favorite targets for Youssef’s satire. After an interlude, he returned to the airwaves in October and poked fun at the army-worship that gripped the country after El-Sisi led the military takeover. His then-broadcaster CBC suspended the show for attacking “symbols of the state.” MBC picked up the program in February. Youssef said his team has taped a final episode of the show, Al Bernameg, without expecting that it will ever reach the country’s screens because it “won’t be allowed to continue on any channel inside Egypt.”.

Article: Over the last 30 years, Bangkok, once a small fishing village, has transformed into a rich, concrete, high-rise city that it is today. The spreading metropolis and its population of 12 million now produces 35 per cent of Thailand's economic wealth. As a magnet for foreign companies, Bangkok attracts many overseas managers and business people from different fields, including tourism, automobiles and electronics. The city's population of foreigners is in the high hundreds of thousands, with tens of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and western employees working alongside hundreds of thousands of Burmese who mostly do unskilled jobs shunned by Thais. For those used to the good life, the variety and quality of the city's food is a key attraction, says one US manager, before listing many of his favourite Italian, Mexican and, of course, Thai restaurants. Most offer quality meals for less than the cost of a takeaway sandwich in London. Great choice and value can be found in Bangkok's other attractions, too. For overseas business people who enjoy shopping in luxury and air-conditioned comfort, the city has hundreds of modern shopping malls. Some foreigners, however, prefer the charms of Chatuchak Market, where anything can be bought at a good price by the skilled bargainer. When the time comes to talk business many overseas business people prefer to move out of the markets and onto the golf course. Thailand has thousands of courses, which can provide a welcome break from the busy and noisy city life. But most business people go to the golf course because it's the perfect place to discuss the next big deal. Because of the fast-paced life some foreign business people see Bangkok as a place to stay for the short term, rather than a lifetime. Australian computer software designer Sarah Huang is seven months pregnant but still working full-time in her Bangkok office. She says the city is \\"definitely a place I want to stay for the next five, ten years\\". Nannies and home help are affordable, but high fees for quality...

Article: Imagine looking for your lost dog. You step into a cave . But instead of the dog, you find beautiful cave paintings. You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. Your first question would probably be \\"Who did this?\\" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck? There is one thing the paintings seem to tell us. The Cro- Magnons were interested in the world. They looked at beauty and they understood it.

There are also some other scenes depicted, like a dead man and a bird, but these are less common compared to the numerous depictions of animals. In the Great Hall of Bulls, for example, there is a picture of bulls and horses in many colors, with some of the animals being as large as 18 feet long. Other paintings mentioned include the Little Horses and various drawings of multicolored animals on the ceiling.

Step 3: Verify the correctness of the chosen option for maintaining the flow and continuity of the text. Step 4: Continue the text while keeping the focus on the chosen option. The indirect sunlight helped protect the gymnasium's paint from the harsh effects of direct exposure to UV rays, which can cause fading, chalking, and eventually peeling. This was an essential asset for the preservation of the gymnasium's appearance and structural integrity. Step 5: Add relevant information to further elaborate on the chosen option. Step 6: Ensure that the new information is consistent with the existing text and adds value to the story. On the other hand, the schoolhouse, located on the opposite side of the campus, faced the brunt of direct sunlight. This prolonged exposure led to the deterioration of its once vibrant colors and caused cracks in the exposed wood. Step 7: Continue describing the condition of the schoolhouse to clarify the contrast between the two buildings. Step 8: Illustrate the effect of sunlight on the paint and structure. Unfortunately, the budget for maintenance had been limited, and repainting the schoolhouse was not a top priority. As a result, students, teachers, and visitors were often struck by the striking difference between the well-maintained gymnasium and the aging schoolhouse. Step 9: Introduce a possible reason for the situation. Step 10: Describe the reaction of people interacting with the buildings. In an effort to raise funds for the schoolhouse's much-needed renovation, the community came together to organize a series of fundraising events. These events were held in the gymnasium, showcasing its pristine condition and highlighting the urgency of restoring the schoolhouse. Step 11: Describe a possible resolution to the problem. Step 12: Explain how the fundraising events use the gymnasium's condition to emphasize the need for renovation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: An anthropologist gathered observations for two native tribes from southern Africa. He noticed that both tribes spend the majority of the day outside, and therefore they are both exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light. He also quickly realized that one key difference between the tribes was that members of tribe A had dark skin, while members of tribe B had light skin. But I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. What is an answer for this question: Members of which tribe will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency? Answer:","completion":"Members of tribe A, with darker skin, will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency. This is because their skin contains a higher amount of melanin, which is the brownish pigment responsible for the color of the skin. Although both tribes spend the majority of the day outside and are exposed to high amounts of UV light, the increased amount of melanin in the skin of tribe A members acts as a natural barrier that blocks UV light from penetrating the skin. The melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, are present in the epidermis of both tribes. However, the melanocytes of tribe A members produce more melanin due to their heredity. This darker pigmentation serves as a protective mechanism against the harmful effects of UV radiation, such as skin damage and increased risk of skin cancer. Despite the protective qualities of melanin, it can pose a challenge when it comes to vitamin D synthesis. Exposure to UV light stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D, which is essential for several bodily functions, including calcium absorption and bone health. Since melanin in tribe A members prevents UV light from reaching the inner layers of their skin, they may not produce sufficient vitamin D levels compared to tribe B, whose lighter skin allows for more efficient vitamin D production. However, it is important to note that this is a generalized observation and that individual risk factors and lifestyle choices play important roles in determining a person's overall risk for vitamin D deficiency. For example, diet and access to vitamin D supplements may influence the levels of this essential nutrient among members of both tribes in the long run. Climate, season, clothing, and cultural practices may also influence exposure to UV light and therefore impact their ability to produce vitamin D. In conclusion, members of tribe A with darker skin are at a higher risk of developing vitamin D deficiency compared to members of tribe B with light skin. This is primarily due to the higher melanin levels in their skin which block UV light from stimulating vitamin D production. However, external factors, such as diet and access to supplements, can play a role in mitigating this risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Who was the wife of the Greek hero Agamemnon who murdered him on his return from Troy?","completion":"The wife of the Greek hero Agamemnon, who murdered him upon his return from Troy, was Clytemnestra. Clytemnestra is a significant character in Greek mythology and literature. Primarily known for her role in the narrative of the Trojan War, her character also appears in various myths, epic poems, and dramatic tragedies. She was the daughter of Tyndareus, King of Sparta, and Queen Leda, making her the sister of Helen of Troy, whose abduction instigated the Trojan War. Clytemnestra married Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae and a key figure in the war against Troy. Her infamous motivation for murder stems from a complex web of deceit, power struggles, and retributive bloody vengeance. Before the Trojan War, faced with unfavorable winds that prevented the Greek fleet from setting sail, Agamemnon was told by the seer Calchas that the winds would only change if he sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to the goddess Artemis. Agamemnon deceived Clytemnestra into thinking that their daughter was to be married to the hero Achilles, but instead, upon their arrival, Iphigenia was tragically sacrificed. This is widely taken to be the root of Clytemnestra's abhorrence for Agamemnon, and her eventual decision to plot his murder. During the ten years of Agamemnon's absence in the Trojan War, Clytemnestra began an affair with Aegisthus, who was the cousin and mortal enemy of Agamemnon. Aegisthus felt he was the rightful heir to the throne of Mycenae, as Agamemnon's father, Atreus, had killed Aegisthus's brothers. Fueled by her resentment towards Agamemnon and influenced by her lover's thirst for power, Clytemnestra formed a plot to murder her husband. Upon his victorious but weary return from Troy, Agamemnon was greeted by an apparently dutiful Clytemnestra, who prepared a lavish bath for him. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, Clytemnestra had placed a net or a robe over the bath, which entangled Agamemnon when he arose, leaving him helplessly trapped. Clytemnestra then murdered him, with some sources stating she struck him with an axe. This act of treachery caused outrage among the Greek society of the time, and Clytemnestra’s actions are often discussed in light of an early debate about femininity, power, and morality. Her reputation in subsequent Greek tragedies is frequently that of a manipulative, deadly woman whose actions led to her own downfall, typically portrayed as being murdered in retaliation by her and Agamemnon’s son, Orestes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Take the soot-stained fabric outdoors and gently shake off any excess soot. Be careful not to shake too vigorously so that you don’t make the stain bigger or spread the soot around any more than is necessary. If you shake the fabric too vigorously, you also risk grinding the soot into the fabric – ultimately making it harder to clean. For fabrics stained with soot, try rinsing them with cold water to remove the stain. Turn the fabric inside out and run it under cool water to get as much of the soot out as possible. Try not to spread the stain further or grind the soot into the fabric with your hands. Try to let the cold water do its job and avoid touching the soot during the process. If you have soot stains on fabric materials like clothing, you can try soaking them overnight in laundry detergent. Fill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of laundry detergent and submerge the items. Let the fabric soak for at least six hours. If the soot-stained items can be bleached without being ruined, add a few drops of bleach to the detergent/water mixture. Use the hottest possible setting on your laundry machine to wash the soot-stained fabric. Use bleach (or color safe bleach, if the fabric requires it) when you run the washing machine. Make sure that you have done all you can to minimize the soot stain before you actually wash the fabric. Using several methods together will be much more effective at removing the stain than just attempting one method. Don’t put the fabric in the dryer until you have checked to make sure the soot stain was completely removed. Otherwise, this could permanently set the stain in the fabric.","completion":"The article provides detailed step-by-step instructions on how to effectively remove soot stains from fabric by shaking off excess soot, rinsing with cold water, soaking in laundry detergent, washing with bleach, and making sure the stain is fully removed before drying."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. Paragraph: The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to 2 1/2 inches high.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend? from the following article ? In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die.

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

In his first leading role Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny Clark, a bumbling eighteen-year-old guy. He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Bure was born in Moscow in 1971 to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. At age 12, his parents separated, and he remained with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six, despite his limited skating ability. At age 16, Bure began his professional hockey career playing for CSKA Moscow. He was invited to the senior club's training camp for the 1987-88 season. Although he was deemed too young, and not yet ready, for the Soviet League, Bure earned minimal playing time filling in for absent regulars. He made his debut in September 1987, and played five games for the senior team, scoring his only goal in his first game. Bure joined the club full-time in 1988-89 and amassed 17 goals, a Soviet League record for rookies. The record would last for 18 years until Alexei Cherepanov scored 18 goals in 2006-07. Bure added 9 assists for 26 points to earn the league's rookie of the year honours. His individual success helped CSKA Moscow capture their thirteenth consecutive Soviet championship and twelfth consecutive IIHF European Cup in 1989 (they repeated as European champions the following year). As a member CSKA, Bure joined a lineup that featured several future NHL players, including linemates Sergei Fedorov and Alexander Mogilny, as well as Igor Larionov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Sergei Makarov, and Vladimir Konstantinov. The combination of Bure, Fedorov and Mogilny formed a promising combination for head coach Viktor Tikhonov, with expectations to replace the previous top Soviet line, the K-L-M combination of Vladimir Krutov, Larionov and Makarov. The trio was short-lived, as Mogilny defected to play for the Buffalo Sabres in 1989, and Fedorov joined the Detroit Red Wings the following year. In his third and final season with the Red Army, Bure tied for the lead in team-scoring with Valeri Kamensky, tallying 46 points. His 35 goals was second in the league, one goal behind Ramil Yuldashev of Sokil Kyiv. Bure turned down a three-year contract extension in August 1991, which resulted in him being left off the roster of the Soviet team for the Canada Cup.

Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad.

Summarize the following: hoose the right beer. Gone are the days when you thought beer only came out of a keg and into a red plastic cup. There are an infinite amount of varieties out there, meaning there's a beer out there that matches your ideal taste. Here's a brief and not-at-all comprehensive rundown (that would take ages): Ales. These ferment quickly and are generally a bit sweeter, fuller-bodied, and have a fruity flavor. Indian Pale Ales (IPAs) have more hops and are generally bitter. This category includes pale ales, wheat beers, bitters, porters, stouts, barley wines, brown ales and tripels. Watch out for tripels – they've been fermented several times and can knock you off your feet. Lagers. These ferment slowly and tend to have a \\"crisper\\" flavor than ales and are, in general, less \\"hoppy.\\" Think of Heineken, Bud Light, Natural Light, Harp, Corona, Miller Genuine Draft – these are all light lagers. This category also includes pilsners, Vienna lagers, bocks and marzens. Stouts. These really fall under the \\"ale\\" umbrella, but they are their own beast. A stout is dark and often creamy, with tastes of chocolate and coffee undertones. There's also oatmeal and oyster stouts, too. For these, think Guinness, Beamish, and Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stouts. Bitters. These are English ales that have a deep bronze look and a well-hopped flavor (in other words, bitter). In general, they have greater depth than IPAs. It's hard to qualify their taste beyond that as there are several categories: session or ordinary bitter, best or regular bitter and premium or strong bitter (often called Extra Special Bitters (ESB)). Wheat Beer (or Hefeweizen). This is an ale with a light yet hazy appearance. It often has a slight banana or clove flavor. Sometimes it's spicy or apple-y, too. It's not bitter and it's often served with a wedge of lemon. Just like red wines and white wines (and hard liquors) need to be treated differently and put it in different glasses, the same goes for different varieties of beer. Here's a few things to consider: Mugs – good for IPAs, red, black, brown, and blonde American Ales, Pilsner, English Stouts, smoked beer, witbier, American and English Porters Pint glasses – good for American Ales, IPAs, Pale Ales, English Bitter and mild English Ales, cream ales, dark Lager and Stouts. Goblets: Belgian IPAs and strong, dark ales, quadruples and tripels Pilsner glasses: Vienna and Japanese lagers, Euro dark and strong lagers, American malt liquors, pale and red lagers, doppelbocks Weizen glasses: Dark and pale wheat ales, and all \\"weizens\\" Beer pairs just as well – if not better – with food like wine. And in general, it's the same idea: lighter foods like salads and fish go with lighter beers. Heavier foods and meatier meats go with darker beers. You should also pair \\"regional\\" beers with food of that region. Apart from that, here are a few things to remember: Does your beer have a caramel, cocoa or coffee flavor? Pair it with a smokey flavor, like with char-grilled foods. Is your beer hoppy? This can provide an herbal contract to fattier foods, like salmon, pizza, and fried foods. Is your beer sweet and fruity? Think appetizer plates, like grapes, cheeses, and bruschetta.","completion":"There is a vast array of beer varieties available, each with unique tastes and characteristics. Ales ferment fast, are a bit sweeter and fuller-bodied with a fruity flavor. Indian Pale Ales have a higher hops content and are bitter, with types including pale ales, wheat beers, bitters, porters, stouts, and others. Lagers ferment slowly and have a crisp flavor, generally less hoppy. Examples include Heineken, Bud Light, and other light lagers, alongside pilsners, Vienna lagers, bocks, and marzens. Stouts are their distinct category under the ale umbrella, often dark and creamy with chocolate and coffee undertones. Bitters denote English ales with a deep bronze look and well-hopped bitter flavor. Wheat Beer, or Hefeweizen, is a light, hazy ale with banana or clove flavors. The type of glassware also matters, with mugs suited for IPAs and ales, pint glasses for American Ales and IPAs, goblets for Belgian IPAs, Pilsner glasses for lagers, and Weizen glasses for ales and 'weizens'. Lastly, the pairing of beer with food can enhance the dining experience. Similar to wine, lighter beers compliment salads and fish, while darker beers are ideal with heavier meats. Regional beers also pair well with dishes from their area. Key flavor pairing includes caramel, cocoa, or coffee-flavored beers with smokey foods, hoppy beers with fatty foods and sweet and fruity beers with appetizers like cheese and bruschetta."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Later, it states that 'Royal Doulton' acquired the entire group, which is quite a divergence from the first statement. Therefore, these statements do not convey the same meaning. The primary point of divergence is the role of 'Royal Doulton,' which, according to the first statement, joined the group, while as per the second statement, acquired the group. These subtleties significantly affect the historical consequences and relations within these organizations. Consequently, complete clarity in such information is crucial for accuracy and should not be mistaken as achieving similar meaning.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What authority did Neilston remain under until 1975?, using the article: Neilston is represented by several tiers of elected government. Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead. Neilston Parish Council, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894, and abolished in 1930 following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. In 1890, Neilston fell under the authority of Renfrewshire County Council, where it remained until 1975 when the county was superseded by the regional council area of Strathclyde. In 1903, Neilston was within the Paisley Small Debt Court District and Poor Combination. From 1975 to 1996, Neilston was in the Renfrew District of Strathclyde until the two-tier regions and districts of Scotland were abolished. Since 1996 it has formed part of the unitary East Renfrewshire council area; East Renfrewshire Council is the local authority. Neilston remains part of Renfrewshire for purposes of registration and Lieutenancy. Neilston forms part of..., what would be the answer ?

Movie title: Wanted Movie plot: In Chicago, 24-year-old Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) works at a dead-end desk job with an overbearing boss, takes anti-anxiety medication for panic attacks, and has an unfaithful live-in girlfriend who cheats on him with his friend and colleague, Barry (Chris Pratt). One night at the pharmacy, Wesley is told by a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) that his recently murdered father was an assassin, and the killer, a man named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), is now hunting him. Cross and Fox engage in a shoot-out with hi-tech guns. Wesley panics and runs into the parking lot followed by Cross who steals a truck and attempts to run Wesley down. Fox flips Wesley into her car and then calmly executes a spectacular escape. Wesley awakens in the headquarters of the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins. The group's leader, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), explains that Wesley's panic attacks are actually the untrained expression of a rare ability that allows Wesley's body to distribute massive amounts of adrenaline, granting superhuman strength, speed, and heightened perception. Sloan wants to teach him to control this ability, and to become an assassin and join their cause. Wesley initially panics and returns to his former life. The next morning, he discovers that his bank account now contains several million dollars. The discovery changes his outlook on life, and during a tirade from his boss, Wesley snaps and delivers a public diatribe. Afterward, he picks up a keyboard and during his exit, hits Barry's face with it. Fox arrives while Wesley is outside looking at newspaper headlines of the previous night's events. Wesley is trained for his new life and is soon shown the Loom of Fate, which gives the names of future targets through errors in the fabric. Those the Loom identifies will apparently cause problems in the future, but only Sloan can see and interpret the messages.

The text describes a baseball game in which Mike Mussina, a pitcher for the New York Yankees, performed exceptionally well by pitching three-hit ball for eight innings and striking out a season-high 11 players. This outstanding performance contributed to the New York Yankees' victory over the Kansas City Royals with a score of 4-0 on a Tuesday night. Baseball is a widely-followed sport, particularly in the United States, where it is considered a national pastime. It involves two competing teams with nine players each, taking turns to bat and field. The objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents by successfully striking a pitched ball, running around the bases, and reaching the home plate. In this specific game report, Mike Mussina's standout performance as a pitcher played a crucial role in the Yankees' win. In baseball, the pitcher is a defensive player whose primary task is to throw the ball from the pitching mound toward the catcher behind the home plate, with the intent of getting the opposing batters out. Achieving a high number of strikeouts, as Mussina did by striking out 11 players, can be particularly influential in determining the outcome of a game, as it prevents the opposing team from scoring runs.

Answer the following question: Process: - Fuel mixes with air - Mix gets inducted into cylinder - Piston compresses the mix - Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion - Combustion gases expand - Pushes piston during power stroke - Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tail pipe. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose power stroke will push piston happens, how will it affect MORE power being generated by the engine. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis and evaluate its effect on the overall process step-by-step. Perturbation hypothesis: If more power is generated during the power stroke when the piston is pushed down. 1. Fuel mixes with air: No direct effect on this step. The proportion of fuel and air can be adjusted to deliver more power, as long as it's within the engine's capabilities and tolerances. 2. Mix gets inducted into the cylinder: No direct effect, but to generate more power, a larger volume of the fuel-air mix might have to be inducted into the cylinder, which may require adjustments in the intake system. 3. Piston compresses the mix: No direct effect, although higher compression ratios could lead to more power generation due to increased efficiency in the combustion process. 4. Spark plug emits a spark that ignites the mix causing combustion: No direct effect. However, optimal ignition timing is critical for maximizing power. Too advanced or delayed ignition can reduce power output and efficiency. 5. Combustion gases expand: This is where the perturbation hypothesis takes effect. If the power stroke generates more power, it means the combustion gases expand with more force, leading to increased piston movement and subsequently more mechanical energy being produced. 6. Pushes piston during the power stroke: Directly affected by the perturbation hypothesis. A more powerful power stroke will push the piston down with greater force, converting more of the combustion energy into mechanical energy. 7. Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tailpipe: No direct effect, but a more powerful combustion process might lead to increased exhaust gas pressure, potentially requiring adjustments in the exhaust system to maintain efficiency. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have a direct effect on the power stroke, which can lead to more power being generated by the engine. This can, in turn, affect other aspects of the engine operation (intake system, compression ratio, ignition timing, and exhaust system), which can be adjusted to optimize the overall performance and efficiency of the engine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Approach the person, start a conversation, and make a comment along the lines of “you know, I’ve really enjoyed talking to you. Do you think I could have your phone number and we could do it again sometime?” If you are asking a stranger, don’t worry about having a lengthy conversation. The person likely knows that you are approaching them out of romantic interest. If you know this person before asking for their number, make sure your intentions are clear. You don’t want to come across as a platonic friend looking for support when you are really romantically interested in them. Say that you need to borrow something, for example a pen, and then ask if you can have their phone number so you can call them to meet and give whatever the item was back to them. This is simultaneously flirty and straightforward, a perfect combination. Instead of asking a yes-or-no “can I have your number?” question, offer two choices. “Could I have your phone number or email?” This way, they are more likely to give you a definite means of contacting them. Although business cards are less commonly held by today's youth, swapping business cards is a great way to get someone’s contact.

Once upon a time, Scotland and Sri Lanka were getting ready to play a cricket game. This wasn't just any game; it was a \\"warm-up game\\" in Kent.

Scotland is a country full of mountains, castles, and people who wear clothes called kilts.

Both countries have cricket teams that are full of players who want to be the best. In this warm-up game, Scotland didn't do very well. They lost by a big number: nine whole points!

Price of crude leaps after false reports lane had already been closed off. Cheney calls for airstrike after Iran's refusal to hand back downed spy plane. Iranian fury over Congress calls to assassinate key members of their Revolutionary Guard.","completion":"Title: Crisis Looms Over the World's Most Important Oil Shipping Lane The world's most important oil shipping lane, a four-mile-wide strait that serves as a crucial transit point for crude oil, has recently become the center of a growing international crisis. The situation escalated rapidly following false reports of the lane being closed off, triggering a dramatic leap in the price of crude oil. It further intensified with the former US Vice President Dick Cheney's call for an airstrike in response to Iran's refusal to return a downed spy plane. In a separate, yet related occurrence, Iranian officials expressed fury over calls from the US Congress to assassinate key members of their Revolutionary Guard. At the heart of this crisis lies the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which an estimated 20 million barrels of oil pass every day. Accounting for roughly a third of the world's seaborne oil trade, this narrow strait serves as a critical lifeline for the global economy, connecting major oil producers in the Middle East to key markets across the world. The strait's importance makes it a potential flashpoint for tensions between Iran and Western powers, particularly the United States. The situation began spiraling out of control when false reports surfaced claiming that the strait had already been closed off. While the source of these reports remains unclear, the impact on global oil markets was immediate, with the price of crude oil skyrocketing. This further underscored the strait's vital role in maintaining the stability of world oil prices and highlighted the potential consequences of its disruption. Adding fuel to the fire, former US Vice President Dick Cheney called for an airstrike following Iran's refusal to hand back a downed American spy plane. This demand intensified the already strained relationship between the two nations, raising concerns that an armed conflict could potentially break out in the region. The United States has been known to maintain a strong military presence in the area, with naval forces constantly patrolling to ensure the free flow of oil through the shipping lane. In an alarming series of events, Iranian officials became increasingly furious over calls from some members of the US Congress to assassinate key figures in their Revolutionary Guard. This elite military force, responsible for defending the Iranian government and its interests at home and abroad, has long been regarded as a formidable power in the region. The call for their assassination not only infuriates Iranian officials but also risks further destabilizing the situation in the Strait of Hormuz. As tensions continue to rise, the stakes for all parties involved grow ever higher. With millions of barrels of oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz daily and economies around the world relying on its smooth operation, any disruption could have disastrous consequences for the global economy. Furthermore, an armed conflict in the region could lead to unforeseen and potentially catastrophic consequences, affecting not only the supply of oil but also global security and stability. In conclusion, the significance of the Strait of Hormuz in the global oil market makes this brewing crisis especially alarming. The recent developments, including false reports of lane closure, calls for airstrikes, and proposed assassinations, have heightened tensions and created an increasingly precarious situation in this vital area. As the world watches closely, it is essential for all involved parties to exercise caution, adopt diplomatic approaches, and work toward a peaceful resolution to protect and preserve the region's stability, as well as the world's interconnected economies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The number of people killed in Haiti by the devastating effects of Hurricane Matthew was reported to have risen to at least 478 on Friday as rescue workers and aid agencies battled to reach remote areas of the country, assess the damage and deliver relief. The hurricane, which hit Haiti on Tuesday, brought 145mph winds and torrential rains that destroyed more than 3,200 homes, displaced 15,000 people, ruined plantations and drowned animals. With communications still down in many of the worst-affected areas, it will take days before a definitive death toll can be established. The government puts the number of dead at 122, Radio Television Caraibes at 264, while Hervé Fourcand, a senator for the Sud department, said more than 300 people had died in the region and local officials speaking to Reuters put the toll at 478. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimates that more than one million Haitians have been affected, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. It has launched an appeal for £5.8m to help provide medical relief, shelter, water and sanitation over the next year. By Friday morning Matthew was battering Florida, becoming the first major hurricane threatening a direct hit on the United States in more than 10 years. Efforts to access the worst-affected areas of Haiti – including the Grand’Anse and Sud departments – were at first hampered by flooding, the collapse of communications networks and the destruction of a key bridge. As the weather cleared, Haitian authorities, the UN and national and international non-governmental organisations were getting a better idea of the scale of the destruction. The airport in the capital, Port-au-Prince, reopened for humanitarian flights and communication was being restored to cut-off areas. “Several dozen” were killed in the coastal town of Les Anglais in Sud Department, said Louis Paul Raphael, the central government’s representative in the region. Inland in nearby Chantal, the toll rose to 90 late in the evening, the town’s mayor said. Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, the head of the country’s civil protection directorate, warned the death toll was likely to rise as emergency workers reached the stricken regions. “We do know there’s a lot of damage in the Grand’Anse, and we also know human life has been lost there,” she told the Associated Press. The port city of Les Cayes in Sud was also feared to have suffered badly. “The situation in Les Cayes is catastrophic, the city is flooded, you have trees lying in different places and you can barely move around,” its deputy mayor, Claudette Regis Delerme, told Reuters. The devastation in Haiti prompted authorities to postpone a presidential election scheduled for Sunday. Many victims were killed by falling trees, flying debris and swollen rivers when Matthew hit on Tuesday with winds of 145 miles per hour (230 kph). Most of the fatalities were in towns and fishing villages around the western end of Tiburon peninsula in Haiti’s south-west, a region of white Caribbean beaches and rivers backed by hills. The storm passed directly through the peninsula, driving the sea inland and flattening homes on Monday and Tuesday. Yvonne Helle, the UN Development Programme’s Haiti director, said while the lack of access made getting precise numbers impossible at this stage, the scale of the damage was clearly enormous. She said the UNDP had received reports that up to 98% of the city of Jérémie, in Grand’Anse department, had been destroyed. “It has an old historical centre and the old houses have been completely destroyed, ripped to shreds,” she said. “There are aerial pictures of the level destruction and it’s mind-boggling.” Aid groups struggled to communicate with people in Grand’Anse. The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) said agricultural fields in Jérémie had been “decimated”. “Houses in some areas like Jeremie and Dame Marie, which are difficult to access in normal times, are almost entirely destroyed and there are other areas where we don’t know how bad the damage was yet,” said CRS’s senior regional information officer for Latin America and the Caribbean, Robyn Fieser. “Shelter is a huge concern”. Fieser said there was also an immediate need for food and water in the southern port town of Les Cayes as there are “scores” of people in shelters without access to them. Enzo di Taranto, the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Haiti, said the agency was also waiting for a report on the northwest, where it was impossible for aircraft to fly until Thursday. “There has also been some damage in the northwest, but we have no information whatsoever at this stage,” Taranto said. The UN described the hurricane as Haiti’s worst humanitarian crisis since the devastating earthquake six years ago. The rains and flooding have prompted fears of a surge in the cholera epidemic that has killed almost 10,000 people since the disease was accidentally introduced to Haiti by UN peacekeepers. Helle said the 50-60cm of rain that had fallen in some areas had caused graves to open and flooded pit latrines. “I think there are going to be serious, serious health concerns that will lead to communicable diseases related to water and sanitation,” she said. “I’m very worried about that and obviously we still have cholera and this will have an effect on our ability to control that.” Action Aid issued a similar warning. Its country director, Yolette Etienne, said that more than 500,000 men, women and children urgently needed food, clean drinking water and safe shelter. “Cholera is now a real danger as the already extremely poor sanitation system has been totally overwhelmed by flooding and heavy rainfall meaning the disease could spread quickly,” she said. “The situation is even worse in the shelters which often don’t even have enough toilet and are short of clean drinking water.” According to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 15,263 people displaced by the hurricane have been placed in 152 shelters. World Vision, which managed to get staff out to remote areas by helicopter on Wednesday, said sanitation, food and looking after children were its main concerns. “Our teams are seeing a lot of damage, a lot of destruction and a lot of distress,” said Julie Lee, the charity’s spokeswoman in Haiti. “Our biggest worry is children, who are most vulnerable in these times of disasters. We’re also worried about the crop damage … right now, this hurricane is wiping out the Congo bean crop, the sorghum crop – basically staples of the Haitian diet.” The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) and its children’s agency, Unicef, began mobilising resources. WFP arranged enough food supplies to feed 300,000 people for a month, with a further 34 tonnes of food on standby in Miami. Unicef was preparing life-saving aid for 10,000 people in Haiti, while World Vision is to provide water and sanitation help to 50,000 families. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation was poised to deliver seeds to affected areas to help farmers rebuild their livelihoods. US military personnel and nine helicopters were expected to arrive in Port-au-Prince over the coming days to help the relief effort. In Aquin, a town outside Les Cayes, people braved the mud to see what Matthew had done to their clapboard houses and tiny shops. Like many Haitians who were reluctant to leave their homes for fear of losing their personal belongings, Cenita Leconte had initially ignored official calls to evacuate as the hurricane hit. Eventually, however, she gave in – and in doing so probably saved her life. “We’ve lost everything we own,” Leconte, 75, told AP. “But it would have been our fault if we stayed here and died.” In 2010 a magnitude 7 earthquake wrecked Port-au-Prince, killing upward of 200,000 people. However, the impact of this tragedy has been felt most in remote but populated areas far from the capital’s support. “We have nothing left to survive on, all the crops have gone, all fruit trees are down, I don’t have a clue how this is going to be fixed,” said Marc Soniel Noel, the deputy mayor of Chantal.

RB Frank Gore rushed for 88 yards and caught 6 receptions for over 80 yards with two touchdowns. Rookie tight end Vernon Davis and second year quarterback Alex Smith hooked up for a touchdown pass with Smith equaling his touchdown total of the entire 2005 season and passing for an encouraging 288 yards with 23 completions out of 40 attempts. The 49ers had several chances to win it, however, many controversial non-calls were made by the officials, including a blatant pass interference in the end zone, which would have tied the game with just a little over 2 minutes to go. The 49ers would start their 61st season 0-1.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. has manual shutter speed Make this proper case","completion":"Manual Shutter Speed Manual shutter speed refers to the ability of a camera to allow the user to manually set the time for which the sensor or film is exposed to light during the process of capturing an image. It is an integral feature of photography, as it permits the user to control the amount of light that enters the camera and reaches the sensor or film. This control, in turn, affects the image's brightness, color, and sharpness. Shutter speed is commonly measured in seconds and fractions of a second. A faster shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000 of a second) allows less light to enter the camera, resulting in a sharper capture of fast-moving subjects and minimizing the chances of motion blur. Conversely, a slower shutter speed (e.g., 1/10 of a second) permits more light to enter the camera, which can create a desirable motion blur for artistic purposes or reveal greater detail in low-light conditions. In addition to its artistic benefits, manual shutter speed grants photographers the ability to capture specific types of photos that are difficult or impossible to achieve using automatic settings. Some examples of such situations include: 1. Action photography - Sports, wildlife, and other fast-moving subjects require the ability to freeze motion by using a faster shutter speed to obtain sharp images without blur. 2. Low-light photography - In dimly lit environments, slowing down the shutter speed can help to gather more light and capture details that would otherwise be lost in darkness. 3. Long exposure photography - Utilizing a slow shutter speed with a tripod can produce stunning images of star trails, light painting, or smooth water effects in a waterfall or river scene. 4. High dynamic range (HDR) photography - Combining multiple exposures at different shutter speeds can lead to images with a broader range of tonality, detail, and color in high-contrast scenes. When using manual shutter speed settings, it is essential to understand the relationship between shutter speed, aperture (f-stop), and ISO. Collectively known as the \\"exposure triangle,\\" these three factors work together to determine the overall exposure of a photograph. Balancing these parameters is crucial to achieve the desired artistic result while maintaining optimal image quality. In conclusion, using manual shutter speed empowers photographers to explore and create unique images by controlling the time the camera sensor or film is exposed to light. It enables them to capture captivating photos of various subjects and under different lighting conditions, which might be difficult to accomplish with automatic camera settings. Having a solid understanding of the exposure triangle allows photographers to achieve stunning results with complete creative control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware, the software, and to the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How can a computer be attacked?","completion":"A computer can be attacked in various ways. Attackers, often referred to as hackers, exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system to gain unauthorized access, corrupt data, disrupt services, or perform other malicious activities. Below are some of the common methods through which a computer can be attacked: 1. **Malware Attacks:** These are among the most common types of attack. Malware is software that is designed to cause damage to a computer system. Examples include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Malware can be introduced to a system via email attachments, software downloads, operating system vulnerabilities, among others. 2. **Phishing Attacks:** In phishing attacks, attackers attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by pretending to be a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. This is usually done through email spoofing or instant messaging and it often directs users to enter their personal details at a fake website that looks and feels almost identical to the legitimate one. 3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** These occur when attackers insert themselves in the communication between two parties to eavesdrop, steal data or tamper with it. These attacks can happen in any form of online communication, like email or a web browser session. 4. **Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:** In these attacks, attackers overwhelm the victim's network, computer, or service with traffic or requests. This causes the system to slow down significantly or even crash, making it impossible for users to access it. 5. **Zero-Day Exploit:** Zero-day attacks occur during the vulnerability window that exists in the time between when a software vulnerability is discovered and when a patch to fix the vulnerability has been developed and deployed. During this time, hackers can exploit the vulnerability to create significant damage. 6. **SQL Injection:** In an SQL injection attack, an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's database query software to gain unauthorized access to information in the database. 7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This type of attack happens when an attacker injects malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. These scripts can bypass access controls and can be used to compromise the user's data and privacy. 8. **Password Attack:** There are several types of password attacks, including brute-force, dictionary attacks, keyloggers, and credential reuse attacks. In any case, the attacker's goal is to gain unauthorized access by cracking the user's password. These different types of attacks highlight the need for robust computer security measures, including up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, secure network configurations, regular software updates, and the use of strong, unique passwords. Moreover, user education on identifying potential security threats like phishing attempts is also paramount to maintaining computer security."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 'food' category states 'Indian', which is a significant feature. This means that Strada is a restaurant specializing in Indian cuisine. 4. The 'priceRange' is defined as 'cheap'. This indicates that eating at Strada is inexpensive or affordable compared to other restaurants, perhaps making it a good choice for budget-conscious diners. 5. The 'familyFriendly' status is 'no'. This might imply that the restaurant might not offer facilities or an environment suitable for family dinners, kids or could be more oriented towards adult guests. 6. Finally, the 'near' attribute says 'Rainbow Vegetarian Café'. This suggests that Strada is located near another venue known as the Rainbow Vegetarian Café. This may be useful for providing directions or understanding the geographical context of Strada.

A pizza delivery man who witnesses the incident is also shot by the killer and is left in a coma. The following morning, a young woman is killed by a Washington Metro train in what seems to be suicide. Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is distraught to hear that the woman was Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), a lead researcher on his staff. Collins, who has military experience, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a private defense contractor with controversial operations involving mercenaries. Collins tells his former college roommate and old friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), an investigative reporter, that he had been having an affair with Sonia and that she had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which he says is inconsistent and unusual behavior for someone about to commit suicide. Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), a reporter and blogger with the online division of Cal's newspaper and its editor, Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren), discover that Sonia's death occurred in one of only three CCTV blind spots in the Metro camera system. Cal believes the shootings are related to Sonia's death and finds a link between the petty thief and a homeless girl who sought out Cal.

If you believe you have already won an argument or that the other team dropped one, you can briefly summarize those points at the end of the speech, reminding the judge that they go to you. Provide a one-sentence summary of what your opponent has said. Take it one argument at a time, starting with the one that is either easiest to defeat or the most crucial to your case. Say, “My opponent wants to allow one of the most common allergens into our nation’s schools, regardless of how many students are at risk.” Remind the judge what your argument is, positioning it as the clear better choice over your opponent. Choose your words carefully so that your argument appears to be the most reasonable choice. Say, “A safe educational environment is necessary for all students. We stopped sending students to schools that have asbestos; now we need to stop sending them to schools that have peanuts.” Present the breakdown with your argument framed as the best choice. Make the case seem simple to the judge, but say it in a way that makes it seem like picking the other side is preposterous. For example, “The choice is simple: We can protect students from life-threatening allergy attacks, or we can allow a few students to eat peanut butter for lunch.” This argument makes it seem like critical health emergencies are being pitted against something as trivial as a sandwich. Link your argument back to the topic, and provide evidence to back it up. Tell the judge why this evidence proves that your argument is superior to your opponent’s argument. This should take several sentences and possibly several minutes, depending on how many arguments you plan to address in your rebuttal. Never list off your reasons without offering an explanation. Your rebuttal depends on your explanation of the argument. Say, \\"My plan to remove peanut products from schools fulfills the resolution to provide a safe learning environment for kids by removing a known, common hazard. The evidence shows that the threat to allergic individuals is great and that every day the number of allergic students walking the hallways increases. The easiest, least expensive way to protect students is to ban peanut products. Please vote for safe schools by voting for me.\\" You and your opponent may both win arguments within the debate, but the judge still has to pick a winner. Voting issues are the arguments that could make or break a case, so showing that your argument is a voting issue could make the judge choose your side. For example, relevancy is often a good voting issue because if an argument is not relevant, then it is ineffective. If you show the judge that your opponent has no relevancy on the topic, then that could be a voting issue that goes your way. Say, \\"My opponent argued that we should ban sugary foods instead of peanut butter, but that is not relevant to my case. None of the evidence she provided about the dangers of sugary food should be considered.\\" Briefly summarize your arguments and the voting issues, then urge the judge to vote for you. Say, “The evidence I’ve provided proves that my opponent’s argument lacks relevancy and fails to address the topic. Additionally, my opponent has falsely assumed that peanuts must be ingested to be harmful, which is factually untrue. For these reasons, you should vote for my case.” If you don’t address an argument, it could go to the other team. Even if you are losing an argument, it’s best to offer a short concession in your rebuttal before moving on to your stronger arguments. If your opponent points out that you dropped an argument, it will look worse than if you concede it yourself. You should also watch for arguments that your opponent has dropped. Make sure to point this out to the judge and tell them that you have clearly won that point. Summary:","completion":"In a debate, you should start with new arguments and address them quickly. When you speak, briefly review your other points and remind the judge of your argument. Choose your words carefully and make your argument seem like the best choice. Provide evidence to support your argument and explain why your side is better. Show the judge the other side's weaknesses, like if their argument is not relevant. Remember to talk about all points in the debate, even if you're losing. In the end, summarize your arguments and ask the judge to vote for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hundreds and maybe thousands will gather in Gary, Ind., the Jackson family hometown, to witness the unveiling of a statue to honor the pop icon; his mother Katherine is expected to attend. In Los Angeles fans will gather at Forest Lawn Memorial Park where the King of Pop is entombed. And in Detroit, where it all started, Motown announces today the opening of an exhibit, which will feature photographs from concert performances, television appearances, international tours and the TV cartoon series featuring the Jackson 5. Motown Museum curator Lina Stephens was online Friday, June 25, at Noon ET to talk about the early days of the Jackson 5, the emergence of Michael Jackson as a solo artist and stories of of their lives on the road and on the charts. Lina Stephens: Hello, I'm Lina Stephens, Chief Curator of the Motown Museum. Bethesda, Md.: How was Michael offstage..during the Motown years..his demeanor Lina Stephens: He was a shy, child, he enjoyed playing with his brothers. Los Angeles, Calif.: What would be your thoughts about either moving or having a second museum honoring Michael Jackson in Los Angeles? I ask this because it would be more accessible to more fans than would Gary, and Michael also had strong roots to southern California. Lina Stephens: I have heard that there is to be a Jackson 5 museum in their hometown of Gary, Indiana. However, I do think that Michael is a big enough talent to support a museum anywhere. Fairfax, Va.: Back in the day were the Jackson 5 enamored of the big Motown stars before they themselves became stars? What did the old guard at Motown think of the new young guys? Lina Stephens: They thought that they were talented kids. It was also the beginning of a new era for Motown since the company had moved to LA. Therefore, they were handled in a different manner than the older artists. Washington, D.C.: What will the Motown Museum be doing special today to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Michael's death? Lina Stephens: We have local television and radio stations doing live interviews; we have a Michael Jackson impersonator performing; and, we have the Jackson 5 exhibit in the Museum. We also have Michael Jackson items in the gift shop. Annapolis, Md.: Did Michael and his brothers ever come back for a visit to Motown in Detroit? Lina Stephens: Michael has been to the Museum several times. However, we have no record of his brothers visiting. Orlando, Fla.: What's your fondest memory of Michael? Lina Stephens: Michael Jackson had a way of capturing his audience with a flair that can not be justly described. It is clear that he was a very old soul. Washington, D.C.: What was the reaction at Motown and in Detroit when Michael Jackson had died? Lina Stephens: Pure and utter shock. We got the news by 5:20 p.m. (EST) and by 5:30 p.m., his fans had started to leave tributes in his honor on the steps of the Museum. Washington, D.C.: I just have a comment about Michael Jackson. To me he was a man who loved people and just was not accepted for what he was. He was kind and gentle and in this world that should be the norm but it's considered weird. He was one of if not the best entertainer of all time. His fans seem to see him in a better light than others who made fun of him and made his life a living hell. I don't think we will see anyone of his talent for years to come. Annandale, Va.: Who discovered the Jackson 5? Diana Ross, Gladys Knight? Suzanne de Passe? Lina Stephens: Actually, it was Bobby Taylor of the Vancouvers. Then, Gladys Knight had witnessed the Jackson 5 during a performance at the Apollo Theater in New York. What the?: Am guessing I was born/raised between the two \\"icons\\" of music -- Elvis and MJ -- and so do not quite \\"get\\" their importance. Given this is a MJ chat, what was his definitive contribution to music/culture? Lina Stephens: Michael Jackson achieved a 'first' in a lot of musical milestones: He was the youngest performer to have a #1 hit song and four consecutive #1 hit songs; his album, \\"Thriller\\" is still the best-selling LP of all time; he has had awards created in his name and likeness to award other performers; he was the first African-American artist to have his music videos played on MTV. He also changed the scope of how music videos are traditionally made in that, they were like movie productions that each told a story. His messages of peace and love in his songs and in his philanthropy were not fake. Therefore, millions of people could identify with him and embraced his philosophy as, it did not attack anyone's religious, political or moral views, but it just had a universal appeal. This is what I think makes Michael a phenomenon and why he has so many people, globally, that absolutely adored him. Perryville, Md.: Where the Jackson 5 \\"good boys\\" or were they misbehaved? I've heard stories that MJ was mischievous. Lina Stephens: Yes, all of the Jackson 5 members were good boys. And, yes, Michael liked to play practical jokes, but I think that was to keep things lighthearted on the road. West Palm, Fla: Michael was obviously an profoundly talented child, a prodigy of sorts, but did you have any idea he would become an entertainment icon? Lina Stephens: No, I don't think anyone had an idea that Michael would become all that he did. However, in his musical evolution, his iconic status seemed almost inevitable. Washington, D.C.: What happens at Motown now? Is any recording ever done there anymore? Or is it basically a museum? Lina Stephens: Motown is a Museum. Hollywood, Calif.: Do you remember where you were when MJ died? I do! There is a CNN/HLN host, Jane Velez -- who has covered MJ from the beginning. She should have some fantastic guests on her show \\"Issues\\" tonight. Apparently Michael's father has finally filed a lawsuit -- and I think he could win. So sad.... Lina Stephens: Yes. I had just left work and I had received a call from a local reporter with a confirmation of Michael's passing. That info was the last thing I expected to hear. Hopefully, the events that have occurred after his passing will come to a quick and just resolution and not blemish the memory of Michael. Baltimore, Md.: Did you have any indication back then that Michael Jackson might turn into the person he did and that his end would be tragic? Lina Stephens: Again, I'm not sure that anyone could have predicted the person that Michael would have become. It is very sad that his life would be cut so short. But, as we've seen in history, some of the brightest stars seem to leave us way too soon. Chicago, Ill.: Will anybody move into their home? Lina Stephens: If you are referring to the home in which Michael died, there is someone already occupying it. I believe it is Christian Audigier, the designer of the Ed Hardy line. Neverland Ranch? Not anytime soon. Washington, D.C. : What other Motown stars have come back to visit their old digs? I realize many are dying off and I'm saddened by that. Lina Stephens: Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Joe Billingslea (of the Contours), Duke Fakir (last living original member of The Four Tops), Otis Williams (last living original member of The Temptations), just to name a few! They all come back home. :) Washington, D.C.: When the group recorded for Motown there was a special production team that produced their records which included hand-picked staff producers by Berry Gordy and Gordy himself. Why did he do this? Lina Stephens: The reason is that the hit songwriting of Holland-Dozier-Holland was gone, therefore, Mr. Gordy created The Corporation to create hit songs for the J5. India: Dear Prince, Paris and Blanket We're With You When you miss mj, we're with you in spirit, wondering how you feel, hoping you're coping, and getting a little better each day. We understand. We care. When you're grieving, we're beside you, in our hearts, in our thoughts, we're sending you sympathy, encouragement, affection, and strength to carry on with life. mj would want it that way. we all love you mansi arora Lina Stephens: Michael would appreciate your concern for his children. Lina Stephens: I'm sure Murray will not pay what we all think that he needs to pay. But, he will have to live with what he has done. Jacksonville, Fla.: In the bustle of people coming forward saying all kinds of things what would you like the world to know about Michael that it may not already know? Lina Stephens: I think, basically, we know all we need. I think we need to celebrate the positive contributions of the man. washingtonpost.com: This concludes our chat with Lina Stephens, curator at the Motown Museum. Thanks for joining in.

Summarize this article: For years before the Boston Marathon suspects were identified, American presidents have avoided talking about Chechnya — it’s been a prerequisite demanded by Russia’s leaders for maintaining strong relationships. President Barack Obama and his administration have been quiet on the continued tensions between Vladmir Putin’s government and the area that is its federal subject. That follows the pattern of his predecessors: Bill Clinton pushed Boris Yeltsin to find a peaceful settlement to what began in 1994 as a war to gain independence from Russia, as did George W. Bush. Text Size - + reset Gov. Patrick: Boston on lockdown Boston Marathon suspects photos Since taking office, Obama hasn’t said the word “Chechnya” publicly. But on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry declined to comment on the suspects’ apparent Chechen ties and on whether their involvement would effect relations with Russia. “I’m not going to get into speculation, I’m not going to deal with a hypothetical,” he said. (PHOTOS: Search for Boston Marathon bombing suspects) The Obama administration hasn’t done much on Chechnya, but the Treasury and State Departments have taken some action against Chechans. Defying Putin’s requests, Treasury last week released a list of 18 Russian “specially designated nationals” who face economic sanctions from the United States. The list included two Chechens, Letscha Bogatirov and Kazbek Dukuzov, both of whom are linked to murders. In 2010, State designated Doku Umarov, the leader of Al Qaeda affiliate Islamic Caucasus Emirate, as a global terrorist in 2010. The designation came after Umarov’s group took responsibility for a double suicide bombing on the Moscow Metro, in which at least 40 people died and more than 100 were injured. (Also on POLITICO: Reports: Suspects came from abroad) Umarov’s leadership of Chechen insurgents has “intensified the split between national separatists and radical jihadists and led to a movement seeking to create an Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus with Umarov as the Emir,” the department said in a statement when announcing the move. The White House referred questions to State, which advises that U.S. citizens not travel to Chechnya and the rest of the North Caucasus region. Daniel Benjamin, who was then the department’s coordinator for counterterrorism said in 2010 that the designation was “in direct response to the threats posed to United States and Russia.” “The recent attacks perpetrated by Umarov and his operatives illustrate the global nature of the terrorist problem we face today. We stand in solidarity with the Russian people in our condemnation of these deplorable terrorist acts,” Benjamin added. (Also on POLITICO: Bombing motive: Far from obvious) Umarov’s group has also taken responsibility for a January 2011 explosion at a Moscow airport that killed 36 people. Soon after the attack, Umarov said his group would bring “a year of blood and tears” to Russia, though his group was modest in size. “I won’t tell you there are hundreds of us prepared for jihad. But 50 or 60, God willing, we will find,” he said then. In March 2011, the United Nations Security Council’s Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee added to its list of people associated with Al Qaeda. Since then, in early 2012, Umarov told his followers to stop attacking Russian civilians and focus on military and security targets. (Also on POLITICO: Timeline: Search for Boston Marathon bombing suspects) The Kremlin, meanwhile, has since Sept. 11, 2001, characterized its conflict with Chechens as part of the global war on terror. But Washington has tended to characterize the conflict as an internal issue. “As regards [to] Chechnya, we still hope a solution can be found in a peaceful way,” Bush said in a 2002 interview. “This is Russia’s domestic problem. In my work with Vladimir Putin, I’ll be trying to direct him towards a peaceful solution to the problem.” Follow @politico ||||| A Soviet-made tank is seen near the town of Agdam, controlled by Nagorno Karabakh, and which was completely destroyed during fighting between Karabakh and Azerbaijan forces in 1990s, October 29, 2009. LINE OF CONTACT, Azerbaijan (Reuters) - A dusty trench, interrupted every few meters by lookout posts and gun positions, winds its way as far as the eye can see. \\"Put your head above the trench and they'll shoot you,\\" says a young ethnic Armenian soldier, peering through a narrow slit in a concrete watchtower at Azeri lines 400 meters away where he says snipers lie in wait. The bullets fly both ways. On the other side of the minefields, Khosrov Shukurov's daughter was recently shot in the arm. The 70-year-old Azeri farmer keeps his cows on leashes to stop them straying beyond the wall built to protect his village. Sporadic firefights have intensified along the front line around Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave within Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus controlled by ethnic Armenians since a war in the early 1990s that killed about 30,000 people. Azerbaijan has stepped up threats to take the region back and its decision to give a hero's welcome to a soldier convicted of hacking an Armenian to death on a NATO course has highlighted the risk of a war that could draw in Turkey, Russia and Iran. When the ethnic Armenian majority in Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence as the Soviet Union collapsed, and took over more Azeri territory outside the region than within it, Christian Armenia avoided direct war with Muslim Azerbaijan. It now says it would not stand aside if the enclave it helped establish was attacked. Both it and Azerbaijan have more powerful weapons than two decades ago and if pipelines taking Azeri oil and gas to Europe via Turkey or Armenia's nuclear power station were threatened, war could spread. Armenia has a collective security agreement with its regional ally Russia, while Azerbaijan has one with Turkey, itself a member of NATO for which an attack on one member state is an attack on all 28. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned of a \\"much broader conflict\\" when she visited Armenia in June and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Friday he was \\"deeply concerned\\" by the Azeri soldier's pardon last month. UPHILL BATTLE Political and military analysts say war is not inevitable, and that the potential for destruction and a regional war serve as a deterrent. But they are increasingly discussing how a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan might play out. The most likely trigger is seen as a particularly deadly skirmish on the line of contact between Nagorno-Karabakh-held territory and the rest of Azerbaijan or on the Azerbaijan-Armenia border. Nine people died in clashes in June. \\"At some moment the crossfire will not be limited to the use of small weapons. One side will hit the other with heavy weapons,\\" said Rasim Musabayov, an independent member of parliament in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku. \\"Then you can see a scenario in which the other side responds with air power and then it all goes from there.\\" Less likely would be a political decision to go to war - despite Azerbaijan's threats to regain control of Nagorno-Karabakh - or a pre-emptive strike by Armenia or Nagorno-Karabakh if an attack by Azerbaijan seemed imminent. If a conflict did break out, Azerbaijan would likely try to besiege Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of about 160,000 people linked to Armenia by a narrow land corridor, since the enclave's troops dominate the high ground and have mined elsewhere. \\"A key factor is the topography, the extent to which Nagorno-Karabakh has created defenses in depth. This could make the lower land killing fields. Progress would come at a high cost,\\" said Wayne Merry, a former U.S. diplomat and an expert on the region at the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington. The Azeris could also attack the towns of Jebrail and Fuzuli to the south and southeast, outside the enclave before the 1991-94 war but part of the 20 percent of Azerbaijan under ethnic Armenian control since. \\"SPASMS OF MUTUAL DESTRUCTION\\" Azerbaijan's annual defense spending is more than Armenia's entire budget, but Armenia has warned of an \\"asymmetrical\\" response to any attack, threatening what Merry called a \\"spasm of mutual destruction\\" fuelled by bitterness from the last war. Abbas Aliyev, 66, was forced out of Fuzuli as it was seized by ethnic Armenian troops and settled with his wife and four children in the cramped basement of an apartment bloc in Baku where one toilet is shared by 16 families. He is one of hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them Azeris, who cannot return home until the conflict is resolved. \\"I want to breathe the fresh air of my region again,\\" he said. Ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh use similar words to explain why they would not give the region up. \\"I got all the paperwork I needed to go to the United States but decided not to go. It's marvelous here. Look around you, breathe the air,\\" said Samvel Gabrielyan, an artist in Stepanakert, a quiet city of nearly 57,000 in the mountains. Smart new apartment blocs stand on the rubble of buildings destroyed there during the war. A few still have bullet marks. \\"We'd be ready to fight again if we had to. Otherwise what did all those deaths in the last war mean?\\" Gabrielyan said. Such passions, and a belief on both sides that they can win a war, risk encouraging the politicians and military. Thomas de Waal, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said a war now would be much more destructive than the low-tech conflict of the 1990s. \\"It would be much more bloody and become a full state-state conflict with unpredictable consequences.\\" Obvious targets in Azerbaijan would be the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) natural gas pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) crude oil pipeline. Both are in northwest Azerbaijan, within range of Armenian forces, and have a role in Europe's attempts to reduce its reliance on Russia for energy supplies. A consortium of Western oil companies operates the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields in the Azeri sector of the Caspian Sea, as well as Azerbaijan's large Shah Deniz gas field. Led by British Petroleum and including Norway's Statoil and two U.S. companies, Chevron and ExxonMobil, it has plenty to lose if war breaks out. Each side can hit the other's capital, and Armenia's, Yerevan, is only 30 km from its Metsamor nuclear power plant. Northwest Azerbaijan contains a water reservoir and power station as well as an international highway and railway. REGIONAL ALLIANCES \\"We think that if hostilities resume, they could not be limited to a local or regional framework. I think they would have a wider geographical spread,\\" Bako Sahakyan, the self-styled president of Nagorno-Karabakh, said in an interview. Turkey closed its border with Armenia in a gesture of solidarity with ethnic kin in Azerbaijan during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and rejects Armenia's insistence it recognize the killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey during World War One as genocide. Russia has a military base at Gyumri in northwest Armenia. Neither, however, would want to rush into a war that would damage their own, fragile relationship and Russia would not want to upset its efforts to deepen ties with Baku. Iran, another regional force, was neutral during the 1991-94 war and would be likely to remain so. But its relationship with Azerbaijan has soured, especially since Baku started buying arms from Israel, and it might be sucked into a conflict if it allowed goods to keep flowing through its border with Armenia. Efforts to find a political solution led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), have had little success, and political concessions are hard for leaders who would risk losing power if they looked weak. \\"Nagorno-Karabakh is an integral part of Armenia. This is how ordinary people see it,\\" said Archbishop Pargev Martirosyan, the Armenian Apostolic Church's senior official in the enclave, which is still part of Azerbaijan under international law. \\"We will do everything to save our land.\\" On the other side of the line of conflict, farmer Shukurov will not move from the village of Ciragli, despite his daughter's injury and the bullet holes riddling his house. \\"That is what the Armenians want, but I will not give up,\\" he said. Diplomats and analysts say that if another war breaks out, it is likely to end in stalemate. \\"The Azeris can't retake Karabakh now. They are militarily incapable of doing it,\\" said Matthew Bryza, a former U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan. \\"I don't think they could dislodge the Armenian forces from the high ground. I think that's extremely difficult.\\" Yusif Agayev, an Azeri military expert and veteran of the war, said there was no mood for a protracted fight. \\"I think it would be a month or two, that is the amount of time our armed forces could fight for. If it drags on longer then it will become a war that society will have to participate in, not just the army,\\" he said. \\"I don't think the society of my country is ready for war.\\" (Additional reporting by Thomas Grove in Azerbaijan, Hasmik Mkrtchyan in Yerevan, Fredrik Dahl in Vienna and Justyna Pawlak in Brussels; editing by Philippa Fletcher) ||||| Author: Preeti Bhattacharji Updated: April 8, 2010 Introduction Chechens are an ethnic minority living primarily in Russia's North Caucasus region. For the past two hundred years, they have generally been governed by Moscow, though they have had varying degrees of de facto autonomy. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Chechen separatists launched a coordinated campaign for independence, which resulted in two devastating wars and an ongoing insurgency in Russia's republic of Chechnya. Militants in and around Chechnya continue to agitate for independence, though the death of separatist leader Shamil Basayev in July 2006 weakened the separatist movement. However, violence in the North Caucasus has escalated since 2008, and Moscow experienced its most serious attack in six years with the bombing of a metro station in March 2010. Share Who are the Chechens? The Chechens are a largely Muslim ethnic group that has lived for centuries in the mountainous North Caucasus region. For the past two hundred years, Chechens have resisted Russian rule. During World War II, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin accused the Chechens of cooperating with the Nazis and forcibly deported the entire population to Kazakhstan and Siberia. Tens of thousands of Chechens died, and the survivors were allowed to return home only after Stalin's death. Has Chechnya ever been independent? Chechnya has experienced several brief periods of de facto independence. In January 1921, four years after the Russian Revolution, Chechnya joined Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia to form the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. But the following year, the Soviet Union seized control of Chechnya and turned it into a Soviet province called the Chechen Autonomous Oblast. In January 1934, Soviet officials merged the Chechen Autonomous Oblast with the neighboring Ingush Autonomous Oblast, largely to dilute each region's ethnic identity. During World War II, as German forces moved into the Soviet Union and toward the North Caucasus, many ethnic minority groups subject to Soviet and Russian rule for generations seized on the opportunity presented by the war to try and break free. German forces never reached Chechnya, but Chechen nationalist Khasan Israilov led a revolt against Soviet rule which lasted from 1940 to 1944. After Soviet troops crushed the rebellion, Stalin accused the Chechens of collaborating with Nazi invaders. In 1944, Stalin disbanded the Chechen-Ingush republic altogether and forcibly deported the entire Chechen population to Siberia and Kazakhstan. Chechens were not allowed to return to their homeland until 1957, when Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, restored the province amid de-Stalinization. What is the post-Soviet history of violence in Chechnya? In the early 1990s, following the Soviet collapse, separatists in the newly formed Russian Federation Republic of Chechnya started an independence movement called the Chechen All-National Congress. Russian President Boris Yeltsin opposed Chechen independence, arguing that Chechnya was an integral part of Russia. From 1994 to 1996, Russia fought Chechen guerillas in a conflict that became known as the First Chechen War. Tens of thousands of civilians died, but Russia failed to win control of Chechnya's mountainous terrain, giving Chechnya de facto independence. In May 1996, Yeltsin signed a ceasefire with the separatists, and they agreed on a peace treaty the following year. But violence flared again three years later. In August 1999, Chechen militants invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan to support a local separatist movement. The following month, five bombs exploded in Russia over a ten-day period, killing almost three hundred civilians. Moscow blamed Chechen rebels for the explosions, which comprised the largest coordinated terrorist attack in Russian history. The Dagestan invasion and the Russian bombings prompted Russian forces to launch the Second Chechen War, also known as the War in the North Caucasus. In February 2000, Russia recaptured the Chechen capital of Grozny, destroying a good part of the city center in the process, reasserting direct control over Chechnya. Tens of thousands of Chechens and Russians were killed or wounded in the two wars, and hundreds of thousands of civilians were displaced. Since the end of the second war, Chechen separatist activity has diminished, and the July 2006 death of separatist leader Shamil Basayev--in an explosion many see as the work of Russia's internal security services--seems to have stifled the movement. Since 2008, however, violence has markedly increased in the North Caucasus, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Incidents of violence rose from 795 in 2008 to 1,100 in 2009, and suicide bombings quadrupled in 2009, the majority of which occurred in Chechnya. Which terrorist groups operate in Chechnya? Information about groups linked to the conflict in Chechnya is hard to confirm, but experts say the struggle is between local separatists--a loosely organized group with semi-independent commanders--and the Russian army. According to the U.S. State Department, the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB) is the primary channel for Islamic funding of the Chechen guerillas, in part through links to al-Qaeda-related financiers on the Arabian Peninsula. The United States also defined the Chechnya-based Special Purpose Islamic Regiment (SPIR) and the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs as terrorist entities in February 2003. Chechnya's long and violent guerrilla war has attracted a small number of Islamist militants from outside of Chechnya--some of whom are Arab fighters with possible links to al-Qaeda. Among the Islamist militants, the most prominent was Basayev, Russia's most wanted man. Basayev fought for Chechen independence for more than a decade, and was the mastermind behind the worst terrorist attacks on Russian soil. On July 10, 2006, Basayev was killed in an explosion in neighboring Ingushetia. His death cast doubt on the future of the Chechen separatist movement, and allegedly led to the surrender of five hundred militants. Four months later, Russian security forces killed Abu Hafs al-Urdani, the Jordanian-born commander of foreign fighters in Chechnya. Since then, violence in Chechnya has ebbed, though terrorism in the areas of Dagestan and Ingushetia has increased. What major attacks are the Chechen groups responsible for? The most notorious and devastating attack came in September 2004, when Basayev ordered an attack on a school in Beslan, a town in North Ossetia. More than three hundred people died in the three-day siege, most of them children. There were thirty-two militants, though only three or four were Chechens. All but one of the militants were reportedly killed during the siege. Since then, violence has generally targeted individual officials and government offices rather than large groups of civilians. Attacks include: An August 1999 bombing of a shopping arcade and a September 1999 bombing of an apartment building in Moscow that killed sixty-four people. Two bombings in September 1999 in the Russian republic of Dagestan and southern Russian city of Volgodonsk. Controversy still surrounds whether these attacks were conclusively linked to Chechens. A bomb blast that killed at least forty-one people, including seventeen children, during a military parade in the southwestern town of Kaspiisk in May 2002. Russia blamed the attack on Chechen terrorists. The October 2002 seizure of Moscow's Dubrovka Theater, where approximately seven hundred people were attending a performance. Russian Special Forces launched a rescue operation, but the opium-derived gas they used to disable the hostage-takers killed more than 120 hostages, as well as many of the terrorists. Basayev took responsibility for organizing the attack, and three Chechen-affiliated groups are thought to have been involved. A December 2002 dual suicide bombing that attacked the headquarters of Chechnya's Russian-backed government in Grozny. Russian officials claim that international terrorists helped local Chechens mount the assault, which killed eighty-three people. A three-day attack on Ingushetia in June 2004, which killed almost one hundred people and injured another 120. Street fighting in October 2005 that killed at least eighty-five people. The fighting was in the south Russian city of Nalchik after Chechen rebels assaulted government buildings, telecommunications facilities, and the airport. An attack on the Nevsky Express, used by members of the business and political elite, in November 2009 killed twenty-seven people. In March 2010, two female suicide bombers detonated bombs in a Moscow metro station located near the headquarters of the security services, killing thirty-nine people. Islamist Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for the bombing; he had also claimed responsibility for the derailment of the Nevsky Express. Two days after the metro station bombing in March 2010, two bombs exploded in the town of Kizlyar, in Russia's North Caucasus, killing at least twelve people. Are there links between Chechen groups and al-Qaeda? Experts say there are several ties between the al-Qaeda network and Chechen groups. A Chechen warlord known as Khattab is said to have met with Osama bin Laden while both men were fighting the 1979-89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Alexander Vershbow, a U.S. ambassador to Russia, said shortly after September 11, 2001, \\"We have long recognized that Osama bin Laden and other international networks have been fueling the flames in Chechnya, including the involvement of foreign commanders like Khattab.\\" Khattab was killed in April 2002. Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted for his involvement in the September 11 attacks, was reported by the Wall Street Journal to be formerly \\"a recruiter for al-Qaeda-backed rebels in Chechnya.\\" Chechen militants reportedly fought alongside al-Qaeda and Taliban forces against the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in late 2001. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan was one of the only governments to recognize Chechen independence. Russian authorities, including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly stressed the involvement of international terrorists and Bin Laden associates in Chechnya--in part, experts say, to generate Western sympathy for Russia's military campaign against the Chechen rebels. Russia's former defense minister, Sergei Ivanov, claimed that a videotape of Khattab meeting with bin Laden had been found in Afghanistan, but Russia has not aired the tape publicly. Julia Jeffrey contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"For many years, American presidents have avoided talking about Chechnya.

The United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is \\"the most overturned court in the country.\\" Fox News host Sean Hannity says it’s no surprise that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against President Donald Trump and his executive order on immigration. \\"We have both been predicting for days now the 9th Circuit — the most liberal court of appeals, the most overturned court in the country — it would act this way,\\" Hannity said on his show Feb. 9, speaking with a guest. Several states have sued the Trump administration over its executive order that temporarily blocks immigration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending. So lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States and Alaska and Hawaii. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge’s decision. (The court didn’t rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.) It’s possible the administration will try to appeal their case again, this time to the Supreme Court. Right after the judges handed down their decision, Trump tweeted, \\"SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\\" As Hannity noted, the 9th Circuit has a reputation for being liberal. But we wondered if he was correct when he said the Supreme Court overturns more cases from the 9th Circuit than any other appeals court in the country — the implication being that the 9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court. In our research, we found that the 9th Circuit has a higher-than-average reversal rate, but not the highest. Additionally, experts told us that counting reversals doesn’t necessarily say much about the quality or substance of the 9th Circuit’s work. The numbers To evaluate this claim, we turned to SCOTUSBlog’s Supreme Court statistics archive, specifically their Circuit Scorecards, which track how often the Supreme Court justices agree or disagree with the lower court decisions. The Supreme Court hears cases from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there’s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court’s decision was wrong. In fact, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent. The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate is higher than average, but it’s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit is in third place. 6th Circuit - 87 percent; 11th Circuit - 85 percent; 9th Circuit - 79 percent; 3rd Circuit - 78 percent; 2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent; 8th Circuit - 67 percent; 5th Circuit - 66 percent; 7th Circuit - 48 percent; DC Circuit - 45 percent; 1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent; 10th Circuit - 42 percent. We also found that the 9th Circuit never had the highest reversal rate in any individual term between 2004-15. (That’s the farthest back we could go.) A spokesperson for Hannity pointed us to a 2014 article in National Review titled, \\"Ninth Circuit Leading the Pack for ‘Most Reversed.’ \\" But the evidence presented in the article does not support the headline. So Hannity’s claim that the 9th Circuit is the \\"most overturned court in the country\\" is incorrect. The Supreme Court only hears a handful of cases from each circuit each year, so the rate of reversal is highly variable, said Jonah Gelbach, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a statistician. In 2014, for instance, the 2nd Circuit had a reversal rate of 100 percent, which sounds pretty bad until you find out that the Supreme Court only heard one case from the 2nd Circuit that entire season. The 9th Circuit is by far the largest circuit. In the 12 months leading up to March, 31, 2015, just under 12,000 cases were filed in the 9th Circuit — more than 4,000 more than the next-largest circuit, the 5th Circuit. Despite that gigantic docket, the Supreme Court heard just 11 cases from the 9th Circuit in 2015, reversing eight. This means the Supreme Court generally reverses far less than 1 percent of all the cases the 9th Circuit (and other circuits) decide. \\"Given the small numbers of cases involved, it can be difficult to draw any serious conclusions from such statistics about the quality of the courts involved,\\" Gelbach said. \\"Having said that, the 9th Circuit does seem to consistently have a high reversal rate over time.\\" It’s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more \\"outlier decisions,\\" which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits — leading to a higher reversal rate, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. Roosevelt said there might have been a time in the past when the 9th Circuit was considerably more liberal than the Supreme Court, stemming from the fact that Democratic President Jimmy Carter didn’t get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice, though he did appoint several judges to the 9th Circuit. Today, the 9th Circuit might still have the highest number of Democratic appointees of any appeals court, but there’s been enough turnover in the past few decades that it’s not as much of an outlier, Roosevelt said. Our ruling Hannity said the 9th Circuit is \\"the most overturned court in the country.\\" While the 9th Circuit has a higher than average reversal rate among cases it sends to the Supreme Court, it has not had the highest rate since at least 2004 (the oldest data point we could find). Even if it did, experts told us that the massive size of the 9th Circuit compared to the handful of cases it sends to the Supreme Court every year make reversal rates an imperfect measure of the quality of the 9th Circuit’s decisions. More broadly, experts say this statistic is a poor way of comparing courts. We rate Hannity’s claim False. ||||| President Donald Trump also suggested that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is biased against him and his policies. | Getty Trump attacks judiciary for blocking order on sanctuary cities President Donald Trump accused the “outrageous” 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday of being “semi-automatic” with rulings against his administration. “Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit,” Trump complained in an interview with the Washington Examiner. “And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that's like, semi-automatic.” Story Continued Below Trump said he is “absolutely” considering proposals to split up the three-judge panel, insisting that “there are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit.” Earlier on Wednesday, the president renewed his attacks on the nation’s judiciary, blaming the 9th Circuit for the ruling by a federal district court judge that blocked his administration’s move to deny federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities. “First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. “I’m never surprised by the 9th Circuit,” Trump told a reporter later Wednesday during a signing ceremony for an unrelated executive order. “As I said: We’ll see them in the Supreme Court.” Judge William Orrick, who handed down Tuesday’s injunction, is a U.S. district court judge based in San Francisco and does not sit on the 9th Circuit, although that is the next court that would hear the case should the Trump administration appeal the decision. Some observers consider all federals courts in the states where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to be collectively the 9th Circuit. he ruling was panned by the White House, which released a statement from press secretary Sean Spicer’s office declaring that “today, the rule of law suffered another blow, as an unelected judge unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our Nation.” “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” the White House statement continued. “Today’s ruling undermines faith in our legal system and raises serious questions about circuit shopping.” Before Wednesday’s tweets, Trump’s most recent tirade against the judicial branch was also targeted at the 9th Circuit, which upheld a district court’s stay that blocked his executive order banning immigrants from certain Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. The 9th Circuit has yet to hear arguments on Trump's revised travel ban. Those arguments are slated for May 15. Breaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.

Trump also suggested that the 9th Circuit is biased against him and his policies, tweeting in subsequent posts that “Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the ‘ban’ case and now the ‘sanctuary’ case is brought in the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this ‘judge shopping!’ Messy system.” In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News, Spicer was critical of the federal district judge's ruling to block Trump’s sanctuary cities order. By basing his decision in part on rhetoric from Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Spicer said, Orrick had stepped outside the bounds of what should have been considered. “The idea that any judge or any jurisdiction would not be wanting to help make sure that we can protect our citizens runs counter to, frankly, what we should all be looking for,” Spicer said. “Do you think the 9th Circuit’s got it in for the White House?\\" Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer asked Spicer. “Well, I don’t know that they have it in for the White House,” he replied. “They have a horrible record of interpreting that law. And that’s just a fact.” Nolan D.

He called the administration's position on the order \\"schizophrenic.\\" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) When a long list of comments from President Trump, his surrogates and his spokesmen shows up in a federal court ruling, it’s fair to say it can only mean one thing: a constitutionally questionable executive order is about to get a judicial smackdown. That was true in March, when federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland suspended Trump’s travel ban, saying the administration had showed a clear animus toward Muslims, despite government lawyers’ claims to the contrary. And it was true Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick of California temporarily froze Trump’s executive order on sanctuary cities, ruling that a case could be made that it violated the Constitution. [Trump blasts federal court ruling that blocks his ‘sanctuary city’ order] Trump’s order, signed Jan. 25, threatens to cut off funding from local governments that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities. Santa Clara County and the city of San Francisco challenged the order, arguing, among other things, that the president doesn’t have the power to withhold federal money. Orrick found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on all their claims, as The Washington Post reported. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera praised the ruling by a U.S. District judge in San Francisco that blocked President Trump's executive order that sought to withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities. (Reuters) The 49-page ruling focused largely on an all-too-familiar theme for the young administration: the consequences of bragging and bluster by Trump and top administration officials. Just like the judges who ruled on Trump’s travel ban, Orrick homed in on the vast discrepancies between what government lawyers defending the sanctuary cities order argued in court and what administration officials said about it in public. In court, the government tried to make the case that the order doesn’t actually do anything, at least not at the moment, because the administration has yet to define what exactly a sanctuary city is or threaten any particular jurisdiction with a loss of funds. It was their way of convincing the judge to toss out the lawsuit on the grounds that no city or county has yet suffered any harm. But in public, administration officials boasted about how the order would force sanctuary cities to their knees, singling out particular places. The order described in court as essentially an empty shell was portrayed in news conferences, briefings and television interviews as a powerful tool to protect the public from dangerous undocumented immigrants being shielded by wayward cities and counties. It was that gap that disturbed Orrick. In his ruling, the judge pointed to a February interview between Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, in which Trump called the order “a weapon” to use against cities that tried to defy his immigration policies. “I don’t want to defund anybody. I want to give them the money they need to properly operate as a city or a state,” Trump said in the interview. “If they’re going to have sanctuary cities, we may have to do that. Certainly that would be a weapon.” The judge also cited news conferences in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened to “claw back any funds” awarded to a city that violated the order. And the judge brought up remarks by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who said in no uncertain terms that “counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cities don’t get federal government funding.” On top of that, the judge said, Trump and Sessions had repeatedly held up San Francisco as an example of the supposed dangers sanctuary cities pose to ordinary, law-abiding citizens because of the killing there of Kathryn Steinle in July 2015, allegedly by a man deported five times. It was more than enough to show the intent of Trump’s order, Orrick wrote. But government lawyers sang an entirely different tune. According to Orrick, the government contended that the order was merely an example of Trump using the “bully pulpit” to “highlight a changed approach to immigration enforcement” — in essence, something much more benign than what Trump and company had described. The argument was lost on the judge, who ridiculed the government’s position as “schizophrenic.” “If there was doubt about the scope of the Order, the President and Attorney General have erased it with their public comments,” Orrick wrote. “Is the Order merely a rhetorical device,” he added, “or a ‘weapon’ to defund the Counties and those who have implemented a different law enforcement strategy than the Government currently believes is desirable?” The ruling continued: “The statements of the President, his press secretary and the Attorney General belie the Government’s argument in the briefing that the Order does not change the law. They have repeatedly indicated an intent to defund sanctuary jurisdictions in compliance with the Executive Order.” If all that sounds familiar, it’s because other federal judges reached similar conclusions about the administration’s credibility in lawsuits challenging Trump’s travel ban. In March, judges in Hawaii and Maryland issued rulings that temporarily halted parts of the executive order, which seeks to bar new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries. In both cases, judges found that what government lawyers said in court about the ban being religiously neutral didn’t line up with remarks from Trump and some of his closest advisers, who had previously called for a “Muslim ban.” The administration’s intent was obvious, the judges said. “Plainly-worded” statements by Trump and his surrogates “betrayed the Executive Order’s stated secular purpose,” one judge wrote, using language strikingly similar to Orrick’s. As long as the administration continues to issue broad executive orders, it should expect to have statements by its top officials to come up in court, said Jayashri Srikantiah, an immigration law professor at Stanford Law School. “It’s hard to imagine not seeing more of these kinds of legal challenges,” she said. “The president is the president and the attorney general is the attorney general, and we have to take seriously what they say about an executive order with such sweeping implications.” President Trump has threatened to go after sanctuary cities, which provide protections for illegal immigrants. Chicago announced on Aug. 6 they plan to sue the Trump administration over threats to withhold public safety grant money from sanctuary cities. This is how other state and local governments with sanctuary policies have responded. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) The Trump administration has vowed to fight rulings on the travel ban and sanctuary cities. In a series of tweets Wednesday, Trump vowed that the White House was ready to bring the case to the Supreme Court and blasted the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which was part of legal decisions blocking Trump’s travel restrictions on several Muslim-majority countries. “First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities — both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!” Trump wrote. Orrick is a federal district judge in San Francisco. He does not serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, although those judges would review his decisions. In an earlier statement, the White House took aim at Orrick, saying his ruling “unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation.” “This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” the White House statement said. The ruling puts the executive order on hold while the judge weighs the full evidence in the case. At issue is whether the order violates the Constitution by giving the president spending powers reserved for Congress and by infringing on state sovereignty by “commandeering” local officials to enforce federal immigration laws. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the government’s lawyers were reviewing their options. “It’s the 9th Circuit going bananas,” he told reporters Tuesday. “The idea that an agency can’t put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these monies are spent is going to be overturned eventually, and we’ll win at the Supreme Court level at some point.” More from Morning Mix With self-deprecation on menu for presidents at correspondents’ dinner, it’s no wonder Trump is skipping it More lawsuits aimed at Fox News — this time for race discrimination Texas lawmaker on hunger strike in protest of ‘sanctuary city’ bill ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Make the hole about 8 in (20 cm) in diameter. You can use a tape measure to ensure the hole is the size you need. You will need about 120 lb (54 kg) of premixed concrete for 1 post. Place the post in the hole. While someone holds the post in position, fill the the hole with concrete. Pour the concrete until it is about 4 in (10 cm) below the ground’s surface. The other person should hold the post straight. If it doesn’t look right, adjust it quickly before the concrete solidifies. Fit the fence rails into the holes on the new post, then begin sliding the panels onto the rails. Screw the rails to the inside of the post. Then, attach the panels, screwing them in place if they also use screws.","completion":"The process described involves removing and replacing a fence post with the associated rails and panels. First, the rails connected to the post are removed by turning the screws counterclockwise. Both the top and bottom rails are then pulled away from the post. In case of difficulties installing a new post, it's advised to completely remove the rails and panels to create more space. Next, the old post and any fragments in the ground are removed. If the post was held by concrete, the surrounding dirt must be dug up to remove the concrete, which can be refilled later. To determine the placement of the new post, measure the distance between two existing posts, ensuring the new post is an equal distance from the last post. Mark the location with paint, tape, or another suitable indicator. It is critical for the new post to be even and straight for proper fitting of the rails and panels. Dig a hole at the marked location, measuring approximately 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter. The hole should be filled with approximately 120 pounds (54 kg) of premixed concrete for one post, up to about 4 inches (10 cm) below the ground's surface. As one person holds the post in position, another should fill the hole with concrete, making sure the post is straight and adjusting as necessary prior to the concrete solidifying. Finally, the fence rails are fitted into the holes on the new post and the panels are slid onto the rails. The rails are then screwed to the inside of the post, followed by attaching the panels and securing them in place with screws, if applicable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Math problem: Solve -24 = 16*q - 22*q for q. What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -24 = 16*q - 22*q for q, you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. The equation given is -24 = 16*q - 22*q. Since both 16*q and -22*q have the same variable (q), we can combine these like terms. 16*q - 22*q = (16 - 22)*q = -6*q Now the equation is -24 = -6*q. Step 2: Isolate the variable (q). To isolate q, we need to get rid of the coefficient -6 in front of it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. -24 / (-6) = -6*q / (-6) On the left side of the equation, we have: -24 / (-6) = 4 On the right side of the equation, the -6 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving us with: q = 4 So, the solution to the equation -24 = 16*q - 22*q for q is q = 4."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(AP) — A Missouri man accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old schoolmate when he was 17 was charged Thursday with a misdemeanor child endangerment charge. The charge against 19-year-old Matt Barnett was filed in Nodaway County Court in Maryville. He is scheduled to be arraigned later Thursday. His lawyer, J.R. Hobbs, didn't immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. Special prosecutor Jean Peters Baker has been re-examining Daisy Coleman's allegations that Barnett raped her at a January 2012 house party, when he was a Maryville High School senior and she was a freshman. Barnett says the sex was consensual. The Associated Press generally doesn't name alleged victims of sexual assault but is naming Daisy because she and her mother have granted public interviews. A spokesman for Baker, Mike Mansur, referred questions to a news conference planned for after the court hearing. Baker stepped in after the local prosecutor, Nodaway County prosecutor Robert Rice, was criticized for dropping the case. He alleged that Daisy's family had stopped cooperating — a claim Daisy and her mother, Melinda Coleman, deny. Before dropping the case, Rice had been pursuing the same misdemeanor child endangerment charge filed Thursday by Baker. Melinda Coleman says authorities didn't do enough to push the investigation forward, and she has alleged that Rice's decision to drop the case was politically motivated — Barnett's grandfather was a four-term Missouri state representative who was a state trooper for 32 years. Rice has denied the accusation. Coleman said her daughter was harassed mercilessly on social media sites and at school after going to the authorities, and that it forced the family to move back to Albany, about 40 miles west of Maryville. Barnett was a 17-year-old senior at Maryville High School on Jan. 8, 2012, when he and some other boys picked up Daisy and her 13-year-old friend from Daisy's house and took them to the home of one of the boys. The girls admitted drinking alcohol in Daisy's home before sneaking out of the house and leaving with the boys, some of whom were friends with her older brother. Daisy claimed that when she got to the party, she was given a clear liquid that she drank before being taken into a bedroom and raped while a second boy recorded the act on his cellphone. The 13-year-old was taken into a different room by a 15-year-old boy who forced her to have sex, something the boy admitted doing. His case was handled in the juvenile system and is not public record. Daisy said she blacked out and doesn't remember much after arriving at the boy's home. Melinda Coleman has said she believes her daughter was given a date-rape drug. Coleman said she awoke around 5 a.m. to a clawing sound at the front door and found her daughter shivering in sub-freezing temperatures. She said she was giving Daisy a bath to warm her up when she noticed signs that she had been assaulted. The case and resulting publicity shook the small college town of Maryville, which was deluged with negative reactions after The Star published the results of a seven-month investigation into claims made by the Colemans. Many people condemned the town on social media — and continue to do so — for seemingly abandoning sexual assault victims. The outcry led to a protest on Maryville's courthouse square in which a few hundred people showed up to show their support for Daisy and lambaste what they labeled as a \\"rape culture\\" that allowed the girl's assailant to go unpunished. The story gained national attention after The Kansas City Star published a lengthy account of Daisy's claims in October. ||||| — Two years and a day after an alcohol-infused house party led to sexual assault allegations, a 19-year-old Nodaway County man pleaded guilty Thursday to a charge of misdemeanor child endangerment. Matthew Barnett of Maryville also apologized to his victim, who was 14 at the time. Facing reporters after the 20-minute plea hearing, prosecutors said they did not have the evidence to file a felony sexual assault charge. There was insufficient evidence, said Jean Peters Baker, the Jackson County prosecuting attorney appointed special prosecutor in a case that has garnered international attention. In this case, and every case, it boils down to the evidence. Baker filed the endangerment charge Thursday morning, just hours before Barnett, accompanied by his parents, entered court to plead guilty. As part of a plea agreement, Barnett admitted that he endangered Daisy Coleman when he left her, barefoot and incoherent in freezing temperatures, in her front yard at 2 a.m. Jan. 8, 2012. She was found there three hours later. Her brother told Missouri Highway Patrol investigators that her face was blue, her hair was frozen and she didnt look alive. The incident, which Baker described as a horrible night, followed a party at Barnetts home, where he and Daisy had sex. Daisy has said she was so intoxicated at that time that she has no recollection of the encounter. Barnett maintains that the sex was consensual. Nodaway County Associate Circuit Judge Glen Dietrich sentenced Barnett on Thursday to 120 days of confinement but suspended the sentence and placed Barnett on two years of probation. Additionally, he ordered Barnett to avoid alcohol, bars and liquor stores, verbally apologize to Daisy, have no more contact with her, perform 100 hours of community service and reimburse Daisys family for her mental health treatment, a total not to exceed 1,800. Though the sentence was suspended, the conviction will remain on Barnetts permanent criminal record. Thursdays plea agreement had been under discussion for more than a month, Baker said. Baker met with Barnett, a student at the University of Central Missouri, before the hearing to receive the apology, which she will pass along to Daisy. This was the outcome we believe was the right and just outcome in this case, Baker said during a news conference after the hearing. Barnett sat quietly for much of the hearing, answering most of Dietrichs questions with a simple yes, sir or no, sir. His lawyer, J.R. Hobbs of Kansas City, did most of the talking on Barnetts behalf. Matthew Barnett accepts full responsibility for the conduct charged, Hobbs said afterward. To be clear, the misdemeanor charge ... accurately reflects the conduct for which he should be held accountable. The case generated outrage in October after The Kansas City Star published a detailed account of Daisy Colemans allegation that Barnett sexually assaulted her. Not long after the party, Barnett faced a felony sexual assault charge as well as a child endangerment misdemeanor count. Nodaway Countys prosecutor later dropped both charges. The endangerment charge Baker filed Thursday is the same count that Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice dropped in the summer of 2012, citing lack of cooperation from the Coleman family. Without referring to Daisy or her mother, Melinda Coleman, by name, Baker said both supported this resolution of a case that focused a harsh light on teenage drinking and its too-often brutal consequences. Baker read a statement from Daisy that said: Today I am grateful that the defendant took responsibility by pleading guilty to the charges. I am ready to move forward. Daisy, now 16, was hospitalized in Kansas City earlier this week after a purported suicide attempt, a family friend told The Star. That friend, Robin Bourland, said Daisy ingested pills Sunday evening in an incident that stemmed from online harassment. She said Thursday that Daisy, though still hospitalized, was recovering well. A statement released Thursday from Daisys mother said: I hope that todays resolution of this criminal case brings some closure for my family, especially my children, and for the community. These last two years have been extremely painful. But today I hope somehow, some way that something good will come from this. Baker asked that the public give the victim an opportunity to heal and create a new narrative in her life. Court records filed Thursday gave this account of the incident: The defendant acted with criminal negligence in a manner that created a substantial risk to the life, body and health of D.C., a child less than 17 years old, by providing D.C. with alcohol until she was substantially intoxicated and impaired, and then leaving D.C. outside of her home in the below-freezing temperatures when D.C. was incapable of protecting or caring for herself. Daisy stayed on the lawn for about three hours, the records said, during a time that the temperature fell to 21 degrees. She was wearing only a T-shirt and yoga pants. Earlier, after Daisy had gone to the Barnett residence, she was provided vodka and was taunted by the other males present to drink from the bitch cup, which she did, the records said. After drinking from it, Daisy did not recall any subsequent events. (She) advised the next thing she remembered was waking up in her yard. About 8 a.m. that morning, more than six hours after she had been left in the cold, Daisys blood-alcohol content tested at 0.13 percent, court records said. A six-page Missouri Highway Patrol report summarized the agencys investigation of the case, which the patrol did at Bakers request. It includes parts of an interview with Daisy, during which she was asked whether Barnett could have been under the impression the reported sexual contact could have been consensual. According to the report, Daisy answered: He was drinking, too, so yeah, he could have. At the time, Barnett was on probation for driving while intoxicated. In the original Nodaway County sheriffs report, which was sealed following the dismissal of the original charges but obtained by The Star, multiple witnesses told authorities that Daisy  incapacitated, crying and unable to walk  had to be carried from the Barnett residence. She was driven home, where, two witnesses said, she was left on her lawn. According to two boys in the car, Barnett and a friend then talked about calling one of Daisys brothers and telling him they had found Daisy drunk at a party and had dropped her off at home. The goal, according to one of the youths, was to keep anybody from finding out theyd had sex with Daisy and her 13-year-old friend. A 15-year-old Nodaway County boy later admitted in juvenile court that he had sex with the 13-year-old, despite her protests. He spent two weeks in the custody of state juvenile authorities and was released for further treatment at home. A third youth initially faced a charge of sexual exploitation of a minor after admitting to taking a cell-phone video of Daisy and Barnett. Authorities never found the video. We tried to obtain the video, and without the video, there is no charge, Baker said Thursday. Local interest in the case was fed, in part, by a suspicion that political influence had played a part in Rices decision to drop the charges, an accusation Rice repeatedly has denied. Rice is a Republican. Barnett is the grandson of a once-prominent Nodaway County Republican state legislator. Baker is a Democrat, as is the judge who appointed her. Asked whether Thursdays court hearing vindicated Rice, she told reporters, That would be your analysis. Barnetts attorney responded more strongly. Two highly skilled prosecutors from two different jurisdictions have now independently concluded that felony charges are not appropriate in this matter, Hobbs said. Further, there is absolutely no evidence that political favoritism played a role in the decision of either prosecutor. |||||","completion":"A Missouri man, Matt Barnett, was charged with a misdemeanor child endangerment after being accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old schoolmate when he, himself, was 17. Barnett allegedly left his 14-year-old victim, Daisy Coleman, barefoot and incoherent in freezing temperatures in 2012, following a house party where both had drunk alcohol and sex was claimed to have taken place. Later officials pursued charges against Barnett, but this was met with controversy, with accusations of political motivation as Barnett's grandfather was a prominent state representative and former state trooper. Initially, the case was dropped owing to a lack of cooperation from the victim's family, as per the local prosecutor. However, the case gained national attention and social outcry, leading to a re-examination. Special prosecutor Jean Peters Baker eventually filed the misdemeanor child endangerment charge, to which Barnett pleaded guilty and apologized to Daisy. The charge related to Barnett leaving Daisy exposed to sub-freezing temperatures, not the alleged sexual assault. As a result of his plea, Barnett was sentenced to 120 days confinement but this was suspended, and he was placed on probation for two years. This included conditions such as alcohol avoidance, no further contact with Daisy, community service, and reimbursement for her mental health treatment. The conviction remains on his permanent record. Daisy has since expressed relief at the conclusion of the case and eagerness to move forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An alleged terrorist leader suspected of plotting the bombing of a Philippine superferry more than four years ago, killing at least 116 people, has arrived in Manila after his arrest in Bahrain, a Philippine justice official said Saturday. Authorities suspect Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. was behind the 2004 superferry bombing. Authorities in Bahrain arrested Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. last month, said Ricardo Blancaflor, undersecretary at the Department of Justice. Lavilla was deported Saturday to Manila, where police arrested him and briefly paraded him in front of local media crews before locking him inside police headquarters, Blancaflor said. Lavilla is one of the top ideologues in the Rajah Solaiman Movement, a group of former Christians who converted to Islam and claim affiliation with the al Qaeda-linked regional terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf, Blancaflor said. Blancaflor said authorities suspect Lavilla helped plot the bombing of a superferry near Manila on February 27, 2004, in which at least 116 people died. They believe Lavilla also helped plan the bombing of a bus behind the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila on February 14, 2005, an attack that killed at least four people and came to be known as the Valentine's Day Bombing. The bus bombing was part of a trio of attacks that happened that day. The two other blasts, both fatal, happened in the southern cities of General Santos and Davao. Blancaflor said he suspects Lavilla was also involved in the planning of several bomb attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Manila, all of which were thwarted by Philippine police. In describing Lavilla's arrest in Bahrain, Blancaflor said only that police there arrested him as they were enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1276, which imposed air travel and financial sanctions on the Taliban. Jemaah Islamiyah aims to create a Muslim \\"superstate\\" across much of Southeast Asia. Authorities blame the group for the Bali, Indonesia nightclub bombings of 2002, which killed more than 200 mostly Western tourists. The group is also suspected of subsequent attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel, both in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The Abu Sayyaf group is one of several Islamic militant groups fighting the government in and around the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. CNN's Rory Suchet contributed to this report.

The Bengals dominated the first half time of possession by more than a 2-1 margin. The Bengals took the opening possession of the game and marched down the field, with quarterback AJ McCarron, playing in place of the injured Andy Dalton, throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver A. J. Green in the corner of the end zone. The Bengals later added to their lead in the second quarter, with wide receiver Mohamed Sanu rushing for a 6-yard touchdown, in a \\"wildcat\\" formation. The Bengals were threatening to add to their lead just before the two-minute warning, but placekicker Mike Nugent missed wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus just before halftime. The Broncos took the initial possession of the second half, and pulled to within 14-10, with quarterback Brock Osweiler connecting with wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders on an 8-yard touchdown pass, which was the only scoring play of the third quarter. After having trouble stopping the Bengals' offense in the first half, the Broncos' defense forced the Bengals to punt on their first four possessions of the second half. The Broncos grabbed a 17-14 lead early in the fourth quarter, with running back C. J. Anderson scampering down the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown. A 52-yard field goal by Nugent helped the Bengals tie the game at 17-17 with 6:51 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Broncos had reached the Bengals' 27-yard line on the next possession, and were attempting a game-winning drive, but Bengals' defensive end Michael Johnson forced a fumble off Anderson, which was recovered by safety Reggie Nelson. However, the Broncos' defense forced a Bengals' punt, and the Broncos' offense began their next drive at their own 20-yard line with 1:40 remaining. However, McManus badly missed wide left on a potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt as time expired, sending the game to overtime. The Broncos won the overtime coin toss, and took a 20-17 lead on their initial possession, with a 37-yard field goal by McManus. The drive was aided by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Bengals' linebacker Vontaze Burfict for a late hit out-of-bounds. The Bengals started their first offensive possession of overtime at their own 33-yard line, and on their first play, McCarron attempted a pass that was incomplete, as his arm was hit by Broncos' linebacker Von Miller. Broncos' head coach Gary Kubiak called a timeout, thinking the play should have been ruled as a game-ending fumble, however, the initial ruling was upheld by instant replay. On the very next play, McCarron fumbled the snap, which was recovered by Broncos' linebacker DeMarcus Ware to end the game and send the Broncos to the postseason for the fifth consecutive season. This was the third game of the season that the Broncos won after trailing 14-0 &#8212; the other two were Week 2 at the Kansas City Chiefs and Week 12 vs. the New England Patriots.

You don't have to share anything you don't want to.","completion":"In the following paragraph, we could discuss some tips and techniques to effectively pretend to be happy: 1. Smile – Even though it may feel forced at first, consciously making an effort to smile can sometimes trick your brain into feeling happier. The physical act of smiling sends signals to your brain that can improve your overall mood. 2. Maintain a positive body language – Stand tall, make eye contact, and maintain an open posture while interacting with others. This will convey a sense of self-assurance and positivity, making others perceive you as being happy. 3. Keep the conversation light – Avoid discussing heavy or overly personal topics that could prompt others to inquire about your true emotions. Instead, engage in friendly small talk and focus on topics that are light-hearted and entertaining. 4. Practice active listening – Show genuine interest in what others are saying by listening attentively and responding enthusiastically. This not only helps to project happiness, but also demonstrates empathy and encourages better communication. 5. Be mindful of your tone and phrasing – Consciously choose positive words or phrases when speaking, and maintain an upbeat tone of voice. This not only helps to convey happiness but can also inspire a more positive atmosphere around you. 6. Surround yourself with positive influences – Spend time with people who uplift and encourage you. This can help to create a happier environment, making it easier for you to pretend to be content. 7. Engage in activities that bring you joy – Participate in hobbies or activities that make you feel good, even if it's just for a short time during your day. This can help to boost your mood and make it easier to project happiness. 8. Consider seeking professional help – Remember, pretending to be happy should not be a long-term solution. If you're consistently feeling unhappy or struggling to cope, consider speaking with a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support. Overall, successfully pretending to be happy largely comes down to developing convincing strategies to project positivity in your interactions with others. By incorporating these tips and techniques, you're not only making it harder for others to detect your true emotions but also taking steps to improve your overall mood.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

One thing to note before ordering is size. I originally ordered a size Small and it was significantly too small for our 10-lb toy poodle. We ended up ordering a size Medium for him. It fits pretty good circumference wise, however it is a little too big for him as it covers a larger area than needed. Even though it is slightly too large for him, there has been no leaks.

A West Tennessee nonprofit organization will use a 300,000 federal grant to hire an attorney and a Spanish-speaking paralegal to help provide legal assistance to domestic violence victims. The U.S. Department of Justice two-year grant will begin Oct. 1, which is the start of domestic violence awareness month. U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson. The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties. \\"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\\" Tanner said in a news statement. The organization doesn't have a staff member who speaks Spanish and the need is increasing with growing Hispanic populations, said the organization's executive director Steven Xanthopoulos. He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year. The group closes about 2,500 cases a year. The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said. \\"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\\" he said. \\"So this was a very good thing.\\" Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson.

Analyze the context: The main keyword in the question is \\"brave squirrel\\". The intention is to identify a location where a brave squirrel would most likely be found. 2. Evaluate the options: a. Street: This tends to be a chaotic environment filled with traffic and danger, making it an unlikely location for most squirrels, even brave ones. b. Forest: While some squirrels might live in a forest, the question specifically asks for the location of a \\"brave squirrel\\". In a forest, squirrels may not typically need to exhibit bravery, as they are well-adapted to their natural habitat and face fewer unexpected challenges. c. Tree: Squirrels live in trees, but similarly to the forest, trees don't necessarily provide a context for squirrels to exhibit bravery. d. Yard: While a yard could serve as a habitat for squirrels, it is still a relatively safe environment, offering fewer opportunities for a squirrel to demonstrate bravery. e. Park: Parks are public spaces that can provide a balance of natural elements and human presence. In this environment, a brave squirrel would have the chance to interact with humans, face potential dangers, and navigate complex situations. 3. Select the most appropriate answer: Comparing the options, I find that a brave squirrel is most likely to be found in a \\"park\\". 4. Final answer: A brave squirrel would most likely be found in a park.

Step 1: Write down the given equation 46*k - 51*k = 15 Step 2: Combine LIKE terms on the left hand side This gives us -5k = 15 Step 3: To isolate k, you have to get rid of -5 which is currently multiplied by k. This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by -5. This gives us k = 15 / -5 Step 4: Simplify the right side to find the solution to the equation. After simplifying, the value of k would be -3 Justification: Each step involves applying basic principles of algebra to simplify the equation and solve for k. By combining like terms, we can simplify the equation to a form that can be easily solved. Dividing both sides by the coefficient of k allows us to isolate k.

Article: When you choose a freezer, remember it's probably going to be with you for a long time. So it's important to know which freezer is right for your needs. First, decide if you want an upright or chest model. Uprights are more convenient. Their storage space is more accessible and they take up less floor area. However, chest models are more energy-efficient because less cold air escapes when they are open. If you are buying an upright, you'll have to choose between frostless or manual defrost . Chest freezers are always manual. Frostless freezers automatically defrost at present intervals and remove the water. Manual models must be defrosted by hand every few months or whenever frost pile up to about a quarter of an inch. To help your freezer reach a ripe old age, try to find a spot that's cool, dry, and away fromdrafts . Drafts and heat will raise the freezer's cabinet temperature, which makes it work harder to keep cool. That means wasted energy. That means wasted energy and a shortened life. Dry air is important because highhumidity can cause the freezer to rust outside and frost up inside. With proper care, a freezer can serve you for 15 years or more. Regular cleaning and simple maintenance will help it maintain a zero-degree temperature and keep it smelling fresh and looking almost new. Frostless models requires less care than manual defrost freezers. The inside of a frostless unit should be washed periodically with warm water and baking soda or a mild soap, rinse, and dried. Good habits go a long way toward a freezer that runs efficiently. To get the most from your freezer, check regularly to make sure it's providing a true zero-degree temperature. Keep the freezer at least three-quarters full. The emptier it get, the more energy is wasted. If more than three pounds of food per cubic foot of storage space is added every 24 hours, the resulting high or low temperature can damage the food. Question: In order to get the best results, you should _ .

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... Question: Following the summit, what does Trump likely believe about North Korea's intent to honor the new agreement? === The answer to the above question is Choose your answer from: -- not enough information -- that the agreement will definitely be broken at some point -- probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations -- that the agreement will not likely bear meaningful results The answer is:","completion":"probably that North Korea intends to keep its promise and continue good faith negotiations. Following the summit, it is likely that Trump believes that North Korea intends to honor the new agreement. This belief is based on several factors, including what has transpired leading up to the historic summit and the messages conveyed during the summit itself. Prior to the summit, North Korea had demonstrated a shift in its approach to foreign relations, suspending further missile tests and expressing a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. This change in attitude was significant enough for Trump to accept the offer to meet with Kim Jong Un. Furthermore, during the summit, the two leaders discussed the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and committing to peace between their respective countries. The first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader resulted in a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty aimed at ending long-standing hostilities between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump's description of the agreement as \\"very comprehensive\\" suggests that he is optimistic about the prospects for progress in the coming negotiations. While there is still some skepticism, particularly from those who recall past broken agreements, it is important to consider the strides that have been made thus far and the potential for progress as negotiations continue. It is likely that Trump has more confidence in the potential for success with this agreement, given the unprecedented nature of the summit and the direct talks between the two leaders. In conclusion, based on the information available, it is likely that Trump believes North Korea intends to keep its promises and continue engaging in good faith negotiations. However, the challenge lies in the implementation and resolution of differences on denuclearization and sanctions relief, which will require ongoing dialogue and sustained effort from both sides."},{"prompt":"Question: Answer the question based on the following text.

Assisting Zionist causes Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \\"deeply moved\\", and \\"at once saddened and ashamed\\" that he could not accept it.

News article: Amnesty International announced today that it has withdrawn its highest honour, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, from Aung San Suu Kyi, in light of the Myanmar leader’s shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for. Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights. Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General, Amnesty International Share this Twitter Facebook Email On 11 November, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo wrote to Aung San Suu Kyi to inform her the organization is revoking the 2009 award. Half way through her term in office, and eight years after her release from house arrest, Naidoo expressed the organization’s disappointment that she had not used her political and moral authority to safeguard human rights, justice or equality in Myanmar, citing her apparent indifference to atrocities committed by the Myanmar military and increasing intolerance of freedom of expression. “As an Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience, our expectation was that you would continue to use your moral authority to speak out against injustice wherever you saw it, not least within Myanmar itself,” wrote Kumi Naidoo. “Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights. Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.” Perpetuating human rights violations Since Aung San Suu Kyi became the de facto leader of Myanmar’s civilian-led government in April 2016, her administration has been actively involved in the commission or perpetuation of multiple human rights violations. Amnesty International has repeatedly criticized the failure of Aung San Suu Kyi and her government to speak out about military atrocities against the Rohingya population in Rakhine State, who have lived for years under a system of segregation and discrimination amounting to apartheid. During the campaign of violence unleashed against the Rohingya last year the Myanmar security forces killed thousands, raped women and girls, detained and tortured men and boys, and burned hundreds of homes and villages to the ground. More than 720,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh. A UN report has called for senior military officials to be investigated and prosecuted for the crime of genocide. Her denial of the gravity and scale of the atrocities means there is little prospect of the situation improving for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya living in limbo in Bangladesh or for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State. Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General, Amnesty International Share this Twitter Facebook Email Although the civilian government does not have control over the military, Aung San Suu Kyi and her office have shielded the security forces from accountability by dismissing, downplaying or denying allegations of human rights violations and by obstructing international investigations into abuses. Her administration has actively stirred up hostility against the Rohingya, labelling them as “terrorists”, accusing them of burning their own homes and decrying “faking rape”. Meanwhile state media has published inflammatory and dehumanizing articles alluding to the Rohingya as “detestable human fleas” and “thorns” which must be pulled out. “Aung San Suu Kyi’s failure to speak out for the Rohingya is one reason why we can no longer justify her status as an Ambassador of Conscience,” said Kumi Naidoo. “Her denial of the gravity and scale of the atrocities means there is little prospect of the situation improving for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya living in limbo in Bangladesh or for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State. Without acknowledgement of the horrific crimes against the community, it is hard to see how the government can take steps to protect them from future atrocities.” Amnesty International also highlighted the situation in Kachin and northern Shan States, where Aung San Suu Kyi has failed to use her influence and moral authority to condemn military abuses, to push for accountability for war crimes or to speak out for ethnic minority civilians who bear the brunt of the conflicts. To make matters worse, her civilian-led administration has imposed harsh restrictions on humanitarian access, exacerbating the suffering of more than 100,000 people displaced by the fighting. Attacks on freedom of speech Despite the power wielded by the military, there are areas where the civilian-led government has considerable authority to enact reforms to better protect human rights, especially those relating to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. But in the two years since Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration assumed power, human rights defenders, peaceful activists and journalists have been arrested and imprisoned while others face threats, harassment and intimidation for their work. Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration has failed to repeal repressive laws – including some of the same laws which were used to detain her and others campaigning for democracy and human rights. Instead, she has actively defended the use of such laws, in particular the decision to prosecute and imprison two Reuters journalists for their work documenting a Myanmar military massacre. Aung San Suu Kyi was named as Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience in 2009, in recognition of her peaceful and non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights. At the time she was held under house arrest, which she was eventually released from exactly eight years ago today. When she was finally able to accept the award in 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi asked Amnesty International to “not take either your eyes or your mind off us and help us to be the country where hope and history merges.” “Amnesty International took Aung San Suu Kyi’s request that day very seriously, which is why we will never look away from human rights violations in Myanmar,” said Kumi Naidoo. “We will continue to fight for justice and human rights in Myanmar – with or without her support.” ||||| Amnesty International has withdrawn a prestigious human rights award from Aung San Suu Kyi, following what it described as a “shameful betrayal” of the values she once stood for. It is the latest in a series of accolades to be withdrawn from Aung San Suu Kyi, including the US Holocaust Museum’s Elie Weisel award and Freedom of the City awards, which were revoked by Edinburgh, Oxford, Glasgow and Newcastle. Amnesty International said on Monday that Aung San Suu Kyi, now Myanmar’s civilian leader, was no longer a symbol of hope, and that it had withdrawn its highest honour, the ambassador of conscience award. It cited her “apparent indifference” to atrocities committed against the Rohingya and her increasing intolerance of freedom of speech. Aung San Suu Kyi received the ambassador of conscience award in 2009, while under house arrest, for her role in championing peace and democracy. She was described as “a symbol of hope, courage and the undying defence of human rights” by Irene Khan, Amnesty International’s then secretary general. Kumi Naidoo, the organisation’s current secretary general, said in a letter to Aung San Suu Kyi that her ambassador title could no longer be justified. “Our expectation was that you would continue to use your moral authority to speak out against injustice wherever you saw it, not least within Myanmar itself,” Naidoo wrote in the letter. Aung San Suu Kyi has been widely accused of being apathetic or complicit in the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, who, the UN has warned, continue to be targeted in an “ongoing genocide”. Who are the Rohingya and what is happening in Myanmar? Read more More than 700,000 Rohingya people remain in Bangladesh, having fled a brutal military crackdown that began in August 2017. UN investigators said that during the campaign, Myanmar’s military carried out killings and gang rapes with “genocidal intent”, and called for the commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law. Yanghee Lee, the UN special investigator on human rights in Myanmar, said she believed Aung San Suu Kyi was in “total denial” about accusations of violence. “Without acknowledgement of the horrific crimes against the community, it is hard to see how the government can take steps to protect them from future atrocities,” said Naidoo. Amnesty International added that Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration had stirred up hatred against Rohingya by labelling them “terrorists”, obstructed international investigations into abuses, and failed to repeal repressive laws used to silence critics. In September, Aung San Suu Kyi defended the imprisonment of two Reuters journalists who were given seven-year jail terms after investigating the massacre of Rohingya Muslims in Rahkine state. The sentences were widely condemned by international governments, human rights groups and the UN as a miscarriage of justice and a symbol of the major regression of freedom of expression in Myanmar. ||||| YANGON: Myanmar authorities and citizens leapt to the defence of Aung San Suu Kyi Tuesday (Nov 13) after Amnesty International stripped her of its top award over indifference to atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims, doubling down on support for the civilian leader in the face of global ire. Aung San Suu Kyi's international reputation as a rights icon is in pieces and Amnesty's move is the latest in a string of rescinded accolades. Advertisement Canada revoked her honorary citizenship last month and the US Holocaust Museum in March took back an award named after concentration camp survivor Elie Wiesel. Institutions that once showered Aung San Suu Kyi with titles are rapidly distancing themselves from a leader they argue is doing little in the face of alleged genocide and ethnic cleansing against its Rohingya minority. Amnesty's Ambassador of Conscience Award was bestowed in 2009 and other recipients include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai and Ai Wei Wei. \\"Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights,\\" Amnesty International chief Kumi Naidoo said in a letter to Aung San Suu Kyi released by the group. Advertisement Advertisement \\"Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.\\" But domestically, Aung San Suu Kyi remains popular across vast swathes of Myanmar and within her party, the National League for Democracy, which won elections in 2015 ending decades of military-backed rule. The stripping of awards not only harms the \\"dignity\\" of Aung San Suu Kyi, but also that of all NLD members, the party's spokesman Myo Nyunt told AFP, adding he thought this was all part of a wider conspiracy. \\"All these organisations are working for the Bengalis who have left the country in order to get citizenship,\\" he said, using a pejorative term for the Rohingya that is widely accepted in Myanmar and falsely implies they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Deputy Minister for Information Aung Hla Tun told AFP he was personally sad and disappointed by Amnesty's announcement and said Aung San Suu Kyi was being treated \\"unfairly\\". Such moves would only \\"make the people love her more\\", he added. People on the street in Yangon were defiant. \\"Their withdrawal is pretty childish. It's like when children aren't getting along with each other and take back their toys,\\" 50-year-old Khin Maung Aye said. \\"We don't need their prize,\\" said Htay Htay, 60. More than 720,000 Rohingya were driven over the border to Bangladesh in a crackdown that started in August 2017, and refugees have detailed horrific testimony of murder, rape, torture and arson. The military says it was defending itself against Rohingya militants. UN investigators have called for top generals to be prosecuted for genocide and accused Aung San Suu Kyi's government of complicity, though has stopped short of calling for her to be hauled before a court. Aung San Suu Kyi became a democracy icon after spearheading the opposition movement to the feared military junta, which resulted in her spending some 15 years under house arrest before her release in 2010. She has yet to comment on Amnesty's decision herself but has in the past shrugged off questions about withdrawn awards. Calls to revoke Aung San Suu Kyi's 1991 Nobel Peace Prize have been rebuffed by the committee that oversees it. Some think, however, that Amnesty's move will be taken more personally because she became a cause celebre for the rights group during her house arrest. \\"This is effectively an excommunication of Aung San Suu Kyi from the pantheon of human rights champions,\\" Yangon-based independent analyst David Mathieson said, adding that the decision would \\"sting\\". ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Amnesty International has withdrawn its Ambassador of Conscience Award from Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's leader, for her failure to address the Rohingya crisis. The organization accused her of betraying the values she once stood for and expressed disappointment in her failure to safeguard human rights, justice, or equality in Myanmar. Aung San Suu Kyi's administration has been criticized for not speaking out about military atrocities against the Rohingya population, growing intolerance of freedom of expression, and perpetuation of human rights violations.

Spacey was born in South Orange, New Jersey, to Kathleen Ann (nee Knutson), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a technical writer and data consultant. He has an older brother, Randy Fowler, who is a limo driver and Rod Stewart impersonator in Boise, Idaho, and a sister, Julie Ann Fowler Keir, an office worker. His family relocated to Southern California when Spacey was four years old. Randy Fowler (from whom Spacey is estranged) has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist \\"Nazi supporter\\", was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey had shut down emotionally and become \\"very sly and smart\\" to avoid whippings. Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of Henry VI, Part 1 in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, starring Liv Ullmann. Then he portrayed Philinte in Moliere's The Misanthrope. In 1984, he appeared in a production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's The Seagull. In 1986, he appeared in a production of Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre. His prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in Jonathan Miller's lauded production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to him and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999. He made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of Crime Story, playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon's Broadway hit Lost in Yonkers. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known. Some of Spacey's early roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on L.A. Law, the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan (1988), opposite Lemmon, and the comedy See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series Wiseguy. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of a bickering Connecticut couple in the dark comedy film The Ref (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire Swimming with Sharks, and the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics. His performance as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in 1995's The Usual Suspects won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Spacey appeared in the 1995 thriller film Seven, making a sudden entrance late in the film as the serial killer John Doe after going unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in Seven, The Usual Suspects and Outbreak earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards. He remarked in 2013: \\"I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch.\\" Spacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in A Time to Kill (1996), and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. He made his directorial debut with the film Albino Alligator (1996). The film was a failure at the box office, grossing 339,379 with a budget of 6 million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also voiced Hopper in the animated film A Bug's Life (1998).

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose husband, the Emperor Claudius, died in a storm at sea? On hearing that her husband, the Emperor Claudius, has died in a storm at sea, Agrippina plots to secure the throne for Nero, her son by a previous marriage. Nero is unenthusiastic about this project, but consents to his mother's wishes (\\"Con saggio tuo consiglio\\"). Agrippina obtains the support of her two freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus, who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the Senate. With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero begin to ascend the throne, but the ceremony is interrupted by the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive (\\"Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!\\"), saved from death by Otho, the commander of the army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne. Poppaea believes Agrippina. When Claudius arrives at Poppaea's house she denounces what she believes is Otho's treachery. Claudius departs in fury, while Agrippina cynically consoles Poppaea by declaring that their friendship will never be broken by deceit (\\"Non ho cor che per amarti\\").","completion":"The name of the person whose husband, the Emperor Claudius, died in a storm at sea is Agrippina."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide a more detailed context and explanation, in June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, marking the beginning of the Korean War. The United Nations Security Council, led by the United States, authorized a military intervention in Korea with the objective to reclaim the territory occupied by North Korea and defend South Korea from further aggression. Within a month after the war began, North Korean forces had managed to conquer most of South Korea, pushing the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army and the United States Army to the southeastern tip of the Korean peninsula, an area known as the Pusan Perimeter. This successful push by the North Korean forces led to a dire situation for the UN Command, as they only controlled a small portion of the peninsula. The Pusan Perimeter was established by the United Nations Command, consisting mainly of American and ROK troops, as a defensive line against the invading North Korean forces. This perimeter was set up around the port city of Pusan (now Busan), which was strategically crucial for the UN Command due to its access to the sea, allowing for the arrival of supplies and reinforcement troops. The Pusan Perimeter was roughly bounded by the Nakdong River to the west and was characterized by a series of defensive positions designed to slow the advance of the enemy. The area enclosed by the Pusan Perimeter represented approximately 10% of the Korean peninsula's total land area, showcasing the desperate situation that the UN Command found itself in. The perimeter itself stretched about 140 miles (225 kilometers) from north to south and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from east to west. During the months of August and September 1950, the UN Command managed to maintain control of the Pusan Perimeter, despite heavy assaults from North Korean forces. Meanwhile, the UN prepared a counteroffensive in the form of the Inchon Landing led by General Douglas MacArthur, which took place on September 15th, 1950. The success of this operation led to the weakening of the North Korean forces and the eventual recapture of Seoul, the South Korean capital, by the end of September 1950."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the band that did not meet commercial expectations and broke up in 1978?, using the article: Marquee Moon was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the country's albums chart. The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure.

The Jamaican Dollar is abbreviated as \\"J\\" to differentiate it from other dollar-denominated currencies, such as the US Dollar (USD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), and Australian Dollar (AUD). The Jamaican Dollar was introduced in 1969, replacing the Jamaican Pound, when the country decided to adopt the decimal currency system. The Jamaican Dollar is divided into 100 smaller units known as cents. However, due to the low value of cents, they are rarely used, and transactions typically occur in whole dollar amounts. The Central Bank of Jamaica is responsible for issuing and managing the Jamaican currency, which is available in both notes and coins. Coins currently in circulation include the following denominations: 1, 5, 10, and 20. The 20 coin was introduced in 2000 to commemorate the new millennium and quickly gained popularity as a commonly used denomination. On the other hand, the 1 cent, 10 cent, and 25 cent coins, previously circulated, have been gradually phased out and are now rarely used in everyday transactions. Banknotes are available in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000. Each denomination features portraits of famous Jamaican historical figures and national symbols. For example, the 50 note features Samuel Sharpe, a Jamaican national hero who played a significant role in the abolition of slavery. The 100 note features the portrait of Sir Donald Sangster, the former Prime Minister of Jamaica. The 500, 1,000, and 5,000 notes feature the faces of Nanny of the Maroons, Michael Manley, and Hugh Shearer, respectively, all important individuals in Jamaica's history and politics. Jamaica is a popular tourist destination, so it is common for foreign currencies, particularly the US Dollar, to be accepted in various establishments, especially within the tourism industry. However, it is essential to understand the exchange rate when making transactions with foreign currency, as conversion rates can vary between businesses. Additionally, using Jamaican Dollars in local establishments and outside of major tourist hotspots is generally more convenient and cost-effective. In conclusion, Jamaica uses the Jamaican Dollar as its official currency, with coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 20, and banknotes in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000. It is important for travelers to familiarize themselves with the local currency and exchange rates to ensure smooth transactions during their visit to the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The doctor diagnosed Victoria with diabetes and not Laura, due to the fact that","completion":"Victoria exhibited more prominent symptoms and risk factors associated with the disease. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes glucose, a type of sugar found in blood. There are two primary forms of diabetes: Type 1, which tends to appear in childhood or young adulthood, and Type 2, which is usually diagnosed in adults. Several key factors played a role in the doctor's decision to diagnose Victoria with diabetes and not Laura. First and foremost, Victoria's family history of diabetes was a significant factor. According to various medical studies, having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with diabetes increases the likelihood of developing the disease. Victoria's mother had a history of Type 2 diabetes, whereas Laura's family had no such incidences. This crucial information led the doctor to pay closer attention to Victoria's symptoms and health indicators. Another contributing factor in the doctor's diagnosis was Victoria's weight and lifestyle. Victoria's body mass index (BMI) was in the obese range, putting her at a higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. In contrast, Laura maintained a healthy BMI, which decreased her chances of developing the disease. Furthermore, Victoria had a generally sedentary lifestyle, with long hours at the office and minimal physical activity. On the other hand, Laura engaged in regular exercise and physical activity, further reducing her risk of diabetes. Victoria also presented with noticeable symptoms associated with diabetes. She frequently complained of increased thirst and urination, known as polydipsia and polyuria, which are classical signs of high blood sugar levels. Her appetite was unusually high, despite consistent weight gain – another common symptom. Moreover, Victoria had been experiencing persistent fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing cuts and bruises, all of which pointed toward a possible diabetes diagnosis. Laura, however, did not exhibit any of these symptoms. In addition to the above factors, Victoria's medical tests provided more evidence of diabetes. Blood tests revealed elevated blood sugar levels and an alarming glycated hemoglobin (A1C) score, both of which are indicative of diabetes. These results were consistent with Victoria's symptoms, and the data further cemented the doctor's belief that she was dealing with diabetes. In contrast, Laura's blood tests returned normal results, and she did not display any abnormalities in her A1C score or glucose levels. Lastly, the doctor considered potential alternative explanations for Victoria and Laura's symptoms before concluding that Victoria had diabetes. They carefully reviewed their medical histories and carefully ruled out other potential causes for Victoria's symptoms, such as thyroid issues, medication side effects, or other health conditions. In the end, the doctor felt confident in diagnosing Victoria with diabetes, given the numerous supporting factors. In summary, the doctor diagnosed Victoria with diabetes and not Laura due to significant differences in their medical histories, lifestyles, symptoms, and test results. Victoria's strong family history of diabetes, higher BMI, sedentary lifestyle, and the presence of classic diabetes symptoms made her an ideal candidate for diagnosis. Additionally, blood tests confirmed Victoria's elevated blood sugar levels and A1C score, while Laura's results were normal. The doctor's careful consideration of all these factors ultimately led to a well-reasoned and accurate diagnosis for both patients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Have you ever seen a big, bubbly hot tub and wished you could have one too? Setting up a hot tub is like putting a giant puzzle together, and today I will explain how it's done! 1. Plan your delivery route First, we need to move the big, heavy tub from the curb (like the edge of the side street) to the foundation (the steady place where it will stay). Imagine you have a giant toy car, even bigger than you! You have to make a clear road for it to reach your play area. Think about the bumps, turns, and obstacles along the way. Can the rims and the giant toy car fit through your door? The same goes for the hot tub. We have to make sure there is a clear path for it to be moved without any issues. This might include moving some things out of the way or trimming trees and bushes. 2. Assemble the hot tub Now, it's time to put the hot tub together–like a giant Lego set! The hot tub has many parts, like the big tub, cover, steps, and control panel. With the help of some grown-ups, we need to follow the instructions and put each piece in the right place. Remember, sometimes it's better to ask for help when things get too heavy or tricky! 3. Hook up the electricity You know how your toys need batteries to make them work? The hot tub needs electricity too. But don't worry, there are special grown-ups called electricians who know how to safely give power to the hot tub. When everything is hooked up correctly, the hot tub can drive water into the jets, and it can warm it like a cozy bath! 4. Prepare the hot tub for use Finally, it's time to get the hot tub ready, like when you fill up a bubble bath. First, we add water to the hot tub–but not too much! We have to make sure to follow the level markings inside. Next, we need to add some special chemicals, like tiny, safe cleaning helpers. They make sure the water stays clean and safe to use. Grown-ups will help with this part, too. Last, we turn on the hot tub and let it warm up. Once it's ready, you can jump in for a super fun and splashy time! And that's it, little ones! Keep in mind that hot tubs can be very warm, so you should always have a grown-up nearby when you're in one. Safety is important, and we want you to have a bubbly good time! Now you know how a hot tub is set up. Next time you see one or even get to use one, you'll know about the exciting process it took to put it together.

By Annelise Russell March 26 In a primary season filled with outlandish policy promises, one has stood out: Donald Trump’s pledge to strong-arm Mexico into paying for and building a wall to stop undocumented immigrants from crossing into the United States. Many observers view Trump’s remarks as nothing more than “cheap talk,” aimed at consolidating support during a competitive primary season. But say he gets elected in November. What happens when the public demands action? A new website by the Comparative Agendas Project, comparativeagendas.net, offers tools to answer this and other questions about how leaders actually govern. In policy areas such as immigration, CAP collects and categorizes policy data and solutions for researchers to analyze. The new online platform — a collaboration by global policy scholars and the University of Texas at Austin — includes a data repository and visualization tool that gives anyone the opportunity to compare previously unavailable policy data across political systems. Let’s look at immigration to get an example of how the database works. Republican immigration rhetoric might give the impression that immigration is the most important issue on the next president’s agenda. But historically, immigration has taken a very narrow slice of presidential attention. And that’s true not just in the United States. Despite increasing rhetoric about migration around the world, advanced democracies routinely ignore immigration, at least compared with the attention they give other policy areas. How do we know this? By analyzing the relative importance of immigration policy in presidential agendas. The Comparative Agendas Project measures executive priorities as expressed in State of the Union speeches. And there, the focus on immigration is pretty small. Here’s how we do it. The project goes through State of the Union speeches. In each sentence, it codes the policy area being discussed. Researchers categorize policy according to 20 major and 220 minor policy topics. The scheme is consistent across political systems and across the types of policy outputs — whether those be U.S. executive speeches, Belgian news coverage or Danish parliamentary questions. Many countries use executive speeches to highlight the upcoming legislative agenda. Using the project’s Web tool, we chart executive speeches in the United States and the United Kingdom for the period 1982 to 2014. Immigration, we find, never takes up more than 3 percent of a president’s State of the Union speech. And that’s even in recent years. For long periods from 1970 through the 1990s, immigration wasn’t even mentioned. The new CAP platform builds off the U.S. Policy Agendas Project, started by Bryan Jones and Frank Baumgartner in 1993 as a way to establish consistent and comparable measures of policy over time. CAP extends their policy-coding scheme beyond U.S. federal analyses to about 20 nations, enabling researchers to measure issues like immigration across a number of countries and governing systems. Looking at executive speeches across Europe, we find similarly scant mentions of immigration as a priority. Since 1990, immigration has never totaled more than 5 percent of executive speeches in the United States or the United Kingdom. Even so, look at the figure below to note the expansion of the topic during the past 20 years in both countries. Over a longer timespan, executives in the United States and the United Kingdom alike spend relatively few words on immigration in addresses to the nation. During the first decade of the 2000s, immigration rose dramatically on the agenda, revealing that the topic has grabbed a larger portion of the executives’ agendas. On the other hand, mentions have declined since 2009, perhaps because of the economic crisis. We can test that speculation by examining the focus on macroeconomics by political executives, but we also find increased interest as a percentage of statements for the United Kingdom, in particular, during the 1980s. Immigration may be a hot-button issue for U.S. candidates on the campaign trail — it is certainly “sexier” than interest rates or price controls — but in practice, immigration is not a traditional presidential agenda item in the United States or elsewhere. And any researcher who has a hunch or a question about whether some other subject is often more talked about than actually put on the agenda — or vice versa — is welcome to check the CAP project. Annelise Russell is a government PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin and director of undergraduate research and education for the U.S. Policy Agendas Project.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the character whose next fight is interrupted by a coyote?, using the article: Hector Villa is a young Mexican national and border-crossing migrant and worker with boxing abilities mirroring his late father's. He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating \\"No work, no pay\\". She scolds Hector for fighting to make money and reminds him that a fighter's lifestyle gave his father nothing. Maria walks in and gets reacquainted with Hector's mother who comments on how much she has grown and how beautiful she has gotten after nine years apart., what would be the answer ?

C. polite - This fits the context of a negative behavior that could make someone leave a restaurant. If the person at the front was rude or impolite, it could create an unpleasant atmosphere that would cause the person to leave. D. spit on me - Although this is quite a negative action, it is a bit extreme and uncommon, making it a less likely choice. E. prepared to pay - This option is irrelevant to the person at front's behavior and does not fit with the scenario of someone leaving a restaurant due to the person at the front.

Continue the following story. card playing and winning needs a lot of wisdom and little tricks to prosper, the A). wisdom should be a lot. B). tricks should be a lot.","completion":"Once upon a time, in a small bustling village, there lived a group of competitive card players who would gather every evening to try their luck and skills against each other. The village folk viewed card playing and winning as more than just a game - it was a symbol of status, respect, and even wealth. Beyond providing enjoyment, card playing was considered the ultimate test of mental prowess. To come out victorious, one needed wisdom and cunning, both of which were essential in profiting in the intricately crafted games of cards. The village was known for producing masterful card players, and anyone who was able to hold their own in the game was revered by the community. There were two key factors that played a pivotal role in determining a victor. A) Wisdom - As the phrase goes, \\"knowledge is power,\\" and in card playing, wisdom needed to abound. The players needed to have a thorough understanding of the rules, the various strategies, and most importantly, how to read the other players' patterns and behaviors. To acquire such wisdom, dedicated players invested years of practice, analyzing countless games and engaging in numerous encounters. Wisdom also involved knowing when to play a particular card, when to hold back, and when to seize the opportunity presented by the game. The wise and experienced players used their understanding of probability, memory, and intuition to outwit their opponents, ensuring a successful game. B) Tricks - Winning at card games required not only wisdom but also cunning. With countless strategies and maneuvers up their sleeves, players needed to be adept at deploying tricks to emerge victoriously. These tricks ranged from simple misdirection to complex bluffs, and even such clever manipulations as diverse card counting techniques. A skilled player would strive to keep their opponents guessing, unable to predict their next move. By mastering a vast array of tricks, a player could take advantage of any situation that presented itself, enabling them to turn the tide of the game in their favor. Now, as it happened, within this village, there resided two exceptionally skilled players: an elderly man named Samuel and a young, talented woman named Amelia. Samuel was renowned for his wisdom in the game, and Amelia was praised for her ability to execute creative and unexpected tricks. One day, as Samuel and Amelia faced off against each other during the evening game, the entire village gathered to witness this highly anticipated match. As the game commenced, it quickly became apparent that Samuel's wisdom and Amelia's tricks would create a game like no other. Through the intense rounds, Samuel showcased his deep knowledge of the game and its myriad possibilities, while Amelia astonished the crowd with her bewildering and mind-bending tactics. The gathered villagers gasped and cheered at every twist and turn in the game, their excitement palpable. As the game wore on, it became clear that wisdom and tricks alone were not enough to triumph. The clever blending of these two elements was crucial. Samuel and Amelia both demonstrated how seamlessly they could combine their respective strengths, ultimately reaching a game of unparalleled skill and technique. In the final round, the tension in the air was nearly unbearable. As Samuel contemplated his move, taking his time to consider the implications of every card and strategy, Amelia feigned a weakness to draw him in. The elderly man, displaying unshakeable confidence, finally played a card seemingly sure to lead him to victory. However, Amelia cleverly countered his move with a stunning combination of tricks that left even Samuel, the wise card player, speechless. As Amelia claimed victory, the entire village erupted in cheers and admiration for both players, acknowledging the incredible display of skill and cunning they had just witnessed. The match between Samuel and Amelia went down in the village's history, forever reminding all those who sought to master the game of cards that a delicate balance of wisdom and tricks was required to truly prosper and become a legend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, it can be inferred that Cameron would feel happy about their grade. This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that Carson got a good night's rest before the test, which is known to improve cognitive function, focus, and overall performance. Since Carson managed to get a good score, it would be reasonable to believe that they are satisfied with their effort and its outcome. Furthermore, adequate sleep is crucial for memory consolidation and the ability to retain information effectively. Researchers and experts often suggest that getting enough sleep before an exam or test can significantly contribute to improved performance. In Carson's case, prioritizing rest allowed them to perform well and likely resulted in a boost of confidence and happiness over their grade. On the other hand, feeling sad or mad about their grade would not align with the given context, as these emotions arise from disappointment, frustration, or a sense of failure – experiences that Carson seems not to have encountered, given their good score. In conclusion, Cameron's emotion, in this case, would most likely be happiness about their grade, given the successful outcome of their test performance and the beneficial role of a good night's rest in achieving that success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He says that \\"chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins\\" and \\"sex Chromosomes determine sex of individual\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What do coiled structures made of DNA and proteins determine?\\" is that these coiled structures, known as chromosomes, determine various traits and characteristics of an individual, including their sex. Chromosomes are thread-like structures found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, and are composed of DNA molecules that are tightly coiled around histone proteins. In humans, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, making a total of 46 chromosomes per cell. Each chromosome carries numerous genes – the basic units of heredity – which determine different characteristics, features, and traits of an organism. These traits can range from physical attributes such as eye color, hair type, and height, to genetic disorders and diseases. One key role of chromosomes is determining the sex of an individual. Humans typically have two types of sex chromosomes: X and Y. Females usually possess two X chromosomes (XX), while males typically have an X and a Y chromosome (XY). The presence of a Y chromosome determines a male sex, whereas the absence of a Y chromosome (and presence of two X chromosomes) results in a female sex. In addition to determining sex, chromosomes also play a fundamental role in the transmission of genetic information from one generation to another. During reproduction, each parent contributes one of their 23 chromosomes to their offspring. This genetic combination from both parents determines the inherited characteristics of the offspring, including physical traits, susceptibility to certain diseases, and more. In conclusion, coiled structures made of DNA and proteins, known as chromosomes, play a crucial role in determining the traits and characteristics of an individual, including their sex and the transmission of genetic information from one generation to another."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

See options at the end Michael bought mealworms as pet food but not Kenneth because Options: [-] Michael had a lizard as a pet.; [-] Kenneth had a lizard as a pet.;","completion":"Michael bought mealworms as pet food but not Kenneth because Michael had a lizard as a pet. This decision was influenced by multiple factors that made mealworms an appropriate food choice for Michael's pet and not Kenneth's. First, it is important to understand why Michael felt the need to buy mealworms as pet food. The primary reason was that Michael had a pet lizard. Lizards are known to thrive on a diet consisting of insects, and mealworms are a popular choice among lizard owners. Mealworms offer a great nutritional value to lizards, as they are a good source of protein, vitamins, minerals, and fibers. Feeding a lizard a proper diet ensures that it stays healthy, active, and has a longer life span. So, Michael's decision to buy mealworms was heavily influenced by his desire to provide the best possible care for his pet lizard. On the other hand, Kenneth did not need to buy mealworms because he didn't have a lizard as a pet. Perhaps Kenneth had a pet that did not require mealworms as part of its diet, or maybe he did not have any pets at all. In either case, Kenneth's situation was different from Michael's, and this shaped their respective decisions regarding pet food. Moreover, different lizards may have different nutritional requirements, depending on their species, age, and size. While mealworms are suitable for most types of lizards, such as geckos, bearded dragons, and chameleons, they may not be appropriate for the entire spectrum of lizard species. It's possible that if Kenneth had a lizard as a pet, it would require a different kind of food, which might explain why he did not purchase mealworms.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the following context: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century. answer the following question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia?","completion":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia was Nobadia.

I do n't want to have to kill people to live . \\" Why might she have to kill people so she can live ?","completion":"The phrase \\"you have control... when you feed\\" suggests that the speaker is discussing a scenario in which individuals need to feed on others to survive. This context, coupled with Shaelynn's response about not wanting to \\"kill people to live,\\" points to the possibility that the characters are involved in a supernatural or fantastical situation. One likely explanation is that they are discussing vampirism, where individuals must consume human blood to sustain their existence. If the speaker is indeed referring to vampires, then the reason why the character might have to kill people to live could be based on the traditional lore surrounding these creatures. Vampires are typically described as undead beings who require the consumption of human blood to maintain their immortality, strength, and other supernatural abilities. In most vampire mythologies, there is a concern about feeding on humans, as doing so could lead to the death of the human victim, thereby tainting the vampire's moral compass. In this context, Shaelynn's concern appears to be about maintaining control over her instincts and actions while feeding. Vampires are often depicted as having a strong, primal urge to feed, which can override their self-control. This could lead them to take more blood than they need, harming or killing their victims as a result. Thus, she fears that if she becomes a vampire or is in the process of becoming one, she might lose control and kill humans during feeding. Another possible interpretation of this scenario might involve a different supernatural creature or a metaphorical situation where an individual must harm others for their survival. For example, a werewolf could be the creature in question, or it could be a discussion about a form of addiction where the characters need to hurt others to maintain their well-being or protect their secret. Regardless of the specific lore or context, the primary concern for Shaelynn appears to be maintaining her humanity and ensuring that she does not have to kill people to live. Whether this involves learning to control her supernatural urges or finding an alternative means of sustaining her existence, the primary focus of the conversation seems to be centered around morality, self-control, and the potential consequences of actions taken in the name of survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: If I tell you that Metals expand when they don't pass all of the heat through themselves to elsewhere, and ask you the question \\"what is the result of imperfect passing of heat through a metal, on that metal?\\", is the correct answer \\"contamination\\"? The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"contamination.\\" Instead, the result of imperfect passing of heat through a metal, on that metal, is \\"thermal expansion\\" and potential \\"uneven distribution of heat.\\" When a metal doesn't pass all of its heat through itself, it absorbs some of that heat, leading the metal to expand. Thermal expansion is a natural phenomenon that occurs when a substance (in this case, a metal) increases in volume due to an increase in temperature. The higher temperature increases the kinetic energy of the particles within the metal, causing them to vibrate more vigorously and move further apart. This, in turn, results in the expansion of the metal material. Moreover, if a metal doesn't pass heat uniformly across its entire surface, the uneven distribution of heat can cause localized expansion, warping, and structural deformations. This phenomenon is commonly observed in the engineering and manufacturing industries, where materials must withstand temperature fluctuations and maintain their structural integrity. Different parts of the metal may be at different temperatures, and this can lead to problems like stress, cracking, and distortions. Contamination refers to the presence of impurities or unwanted elements in a material (such as a metal) that may have adverse effects on its properties, behavior, or performance. Contaminants could be foreign particles, gases, chemicals, moisture, or any other substance that degrade the quality of the material. Although contamination may affect a metal's ability to conduct heat effectively, it is not the primary result of the imperfect passing of heat through a metal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its Labour Link Committee made the decision following the consultation and talks at a regional and national level.

This article: Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were \\"noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance\\", biographer David Buckley wrote that \\"Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation.\\" Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, \\"There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie\\".Musicologist James Perone credited Bowie with having \\"brought sophistication to rock music\\", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The Human League founder Martyn Ware remarked that he had lived his life \\"as though he were an art installation.\\" The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was \\"an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions\\". U2 lead singer Bono commented, \\"I like Bowie when he’s evenly pulled in the direction of being a pop star and Picasso, where he's right down the middle. That’s usually my favorite, when the songwriting is disciplined but the recording is not. I love when he's pulled equally in the directions of art and populism.\\"Broadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was \\"an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things\\". Peel said he \\"liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change\\". Buckley called the era \\"bloated,... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who Martyn Ware remarked had lived his life \\"as though he were an art installation\\"?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who Martyn Ware remarked had lived his life \\"as though he were an art installation\\" is David Bowie. David Bowie was a renowned British singer, songwriter, and actor, celebrated for his unique and influential contributions to the world of music, particularly rock music in the 20th century. He was known for his distinctive voice and eclectic mix of musical styles that spanned across different genres, including glam rock, pop, electronica, and new wave. His progressive approach to creating music and his penchant for reinvention, as noted by Ware, left an indelible mark in the history of music. With his artistry and ability to meld avant garde concepts with accessible pop music, Bowie was often perceived as someone who transcended the boundary between \\"art\\" and \\"populism\\", as Bono, the lead singer of U2, pointed out. His stagecraft and penchant for reimagining himself echoed the ethos of an \\"art installation\\", living his life as a persistent and ever-evolving work of art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA's Office of External Affairs. \\"Why didn't we notice it? I don't know,\\" Riley said. \\"Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn't go through the approval process?\\" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who's testified to Congress about device safety problems. \\"Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing.\\" In a statement, Olympus said it didn't think needed the FDA's permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Outbreak started at UCLA Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with the superbug linked to a contaminated duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, \\"out of an abundance of caution.\\" Not safer According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that \\"could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.\\" The elevator channel of a duodenoscope is cleaned at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. \\"The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn't safer,\\" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA's request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn't want to take them off the market. \\"More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,\\" she said. \\"We believe the benefits outweigh the risks.\\" In its statement, Olympus wrote: \\"The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community. Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures].\\" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus' TJF-Q180V. Not clean enough Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it's not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA's standard for disinfection. \\"We're still working with them to get good data,\\" she said. Riley said she doesn't know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. \\"It's like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?\\" she said. ||||| LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — The superbug bacteria blamed for a deadly outbreak last month at UCLA Medical Center has been linked to four patients infected at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital officials said Wednesday. Cedars-Sinai officials have reached out to those four patients and 67 others who underwent endoscopic procedures any time between August of last year through this February. They’re offering free home-testing kits to determine whether they may have been infected with CRE, a bacteria resistant to the antibiotic carbapenem. One of the four patients infected with CRE has since died, but Cedars-Sinai says that person died from an “underlying disease and not from CRE, as their CRE infection had cleared.” The duodenoscope that was used on the patients has been located and is no longer in use. The hospital is also utilizing enhanced sterilization techniques on the scopes used in their endoscopic procedures. The FDA has acknowledged that the devices can be hard to clean, but says pulling the devices off the market would prevent people from getting life-saving procedures. Dr. Diana Zuckerman, of the National Center for Health Research, told KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO the cases point to underlying issues with the medical devices, which are commonly used in hospitals. “Number one is, the process is much too easy and devices are allowed to be sold that haven’t been really proven to be safe or effective,” Zuckerman said. “The second problem is that even when a company gets caught not properly testing its products…the company just gets away with it.” UCLA officials announced last month that seven of its patients had been infected with the superbug from a similar medical device, and two had died. The hospital also notified 179 other patients that they may have been exposed. UCLA also announced they’d be stepping up their endoscope sterilization procedures beyond manufacturer’s standards.

Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Seven people have become infected with the drug-resistant \\"superbug\\" known as CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after undergoing endoscopy procedures, and CRE may have played a role in two of those patients' deaths, hospital officials said in February, adding that 179 people were exposed to the germ at UCLA. The scopes -- called duodenoscopes, which are inserted by mouth to access patients' small intestine, the pancreas and the liver -- were new and had only been in use since June, health officials said last month. Officials added that the scopes were cleaned in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. The hospital said it traced the bacteria back to two endoscopes manufactured by Olympus Corporation of the Americas. According to the Food and Drug Administration, Olympus had tweaked the design of its duodenoscopes and sold them without seeking clearance from the FDA to do so. Manufacturers are supposed to notify the FDA of design changes 90 days before marketing an altered device, according to the FDA website. It was not immediately clear what Olympus changed about the scopes' design or whether that change could have made the scopes more likely to harbor bacteria or more difficult to clean and sanitize -- and the FDA was not immediately able to clarify. In March 2014, the FDA notified Olympus that it needed the additional clearance before selling the altered devices, but the manufacturer did not submit the request for clearance until October, the FDA told ABC News. The submission is still \\"pending\\" because the FDA asked for more data. Olympus said in a statement that it was working with the FDA. “Olympus modified our 510(k)-cleared duodenoscope in 2010 and determined that the resulting TJF-Q180V did not require a new 510(k) application according to the FDA policy,” the company said in its statement to ABC News. “The FDA subsequently requested a 510(k) notification with information regarding the modified device. Olympus submitted a 510(k) to the FDA and the company continues to cooperate with the agency.” The FDA noted two other companies make duodenoscopes, and FDA spokeswoman Karen Riley told ABC News, \\"It's important to understand that we have received reports of infections associated with the duodenoscopes manufactured by all three device companies.\\" The Food and Drug Administration told ABC News last month that it has been aware of cleaning issues and bacterial transmissions associated with duodenoscopes for more than a year. \\"The CDC first alerted the FDA to a potential association of multi-drug resistant bacteria and duodenoscopes in fall 2013,\\" an agency spokesperson told ABC News. \\"The FDA has been actively working with federal partners, manufacturers and other stakeholders to better understand the issues that contribute to the infections and what can be done to mitigate them.\\" The FDA issued a safety communication about the duodenoscopes following the UCLA CRE cases, explaining that duodenoscopes are used in about 500,000 procedures a year, but meticulous cleaning and disinfecting \\"may not entirely eliminate\\" the risk of transmitting infection. From January 2012 through December 2014, the FDA received reports of 135 patients suspected of contracting germs from reprocessed duodenoscopes, the agency said. According to the CDC, almost every state has had a confirmed case of CRE, but state health departments are not required to notify the CDC about CRE infections. Duodenoscope-related CRE outbreaks similar to the one at UCLA have occurred recently in Chicago, Pittsburgh and Seattle. ||||| Four people developed a drug-resistant infection after a procedure at Cedars-Sinai, officials said. Dr. Bruce Hensel reports on the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on March 4, 2015. (Published Wednesday, March 4, 2015) Four people were infected with a drug-resistant bacteria spread by a device used in medical procedures and another 71 are at risk because they were exposed to the same scope, officials with Cedars-Sinai hospital said Wednesday. The device is used in some endoscopic procedures. In a written statement, officials with the hospital said they have linked the bacterial infection to one device, and have increased the level of disinfection required between patient uses. The hospital initially said 68 people would be receiving notification that they had been exposed to the bacteria that causes the infection, but changed that number to 71. The hospital will be provided at-home kits for self-testing to those people to determine if they have the infection. A similar device was traced back to an outbreak of the \\"superbug\\" at Ronald Reagan-UCLA Medical Center last month. Two people died as a result of that outbreak. The devices are difficult to sterilize completely, and even feature warnings from the manufacturer. The bacteria exists naturally in many people’s intestines and will not affect them, but once it enters the bloodstream it can be deadly. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration.

What is the best way to: how to make perfect coffee","completion":"To make a perfect cup of coffee, it is essential to pay attention to various factors like choosing the right beans, storing them properly, using the best brewing method, and maintaining consistent measurements. Here is a comprehensive step-by-step guide to help you achieve that perfect cup of coffee: 1. Choose the right coffee beans: The first step to making perfect coffee is selecting high-quality beans. Look for freshly roasted, single-origin beans from reputable coffee roasters. Coffee beans from different regions have unique flavor profiles, so you may want to experiment with different beans to find the taste you prefer. 2. Store your beans properly: Store your coffee beans in an airtight container, away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture. Avoid storing beans in the fridge or freezer, as it can cause condensation, affecting the flavor. 3. Invest in a good coffee grinder: Grind your coffee beans just before brewing to ensure maximum freshness and flavor. Using a good-quality burr grinder is important because it provides a consistent grind size, which is crucial for proper extraction. 4. Determine your preferred grind size: The grind size affects the extraction of coffee flavors from the beans. Coarser grinds work well for French press and cold brew, while medium grinds are suitable for drip coffee makers and pour-over techniques. Fine grinds are ideal for espresso machines and AeroPress. 5. Measure your coffee and water accurately: To achieve consistent results, always use a scale to measure your coffee and water. Start with a standard coffee-to-water ratio of 1:15 or 1:17 (1 gram of coffee for every 15 or 17 grams of water). Adjust the ratio according to your personal taste preference. 6. Use fresh and filtered water: Use filtered water to make your coffee, as tap water can contain impurities that affect the overall taste. Also, ensure the water is at the right temperature, which is usually between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C), for optimal flavor extraction. 7. Select the best brewing method for you: Different brewing methods lead to varying results in flavor and texture. Here are a few popular brewing methods to consider: - French Press: Immersion brewing method, great for full-bodied and robust coffee. - Pour-over (e.g., Hario V60, Chemex): Results in a cleaner and lighter-bodied cup, highlighting the coffee's unique flavor characteristics. - AeroPress: A versatile brewing method that can produce smooth and rich coffee or espresso-like coffee, depending on the technique used. - Drip coffee maker: Convenient, automatic brewing option for a classic coffee taste. - Espresso machine: Provides a concentrated and intense coffee experience. 8. Pre-wet your coffee filter (if applicable): If you're using a method that requires a coffee filter (e.g., pour-over, drip coffee maker), rinse the filter with hot water before brewing to remove any potential paper taste. This also preheats your brewing device. 9. Bloom your coffee: Pour a small amount of hot water (around double the coffee's weight) onto your coffee grounds, ensuring they're evenly saturated. Let the coffee bloom for about 30 seconds. This allows the coffee to release CO2, making the extraction process more effective. 10. Brew your coffee: Follow the brewing instructions specific to your chosen brewing method. Pay attention to brew time and technique for the best results. 11. Serve and enjoy your coffee promptly: Coffee tastes at its best soon after brewing, so enjoy your coffee while it's fresh. You can also experiment with different serving styles, such as black coffee, with milk, or specialty coffee drinks. By paying attention to and perfecting each step along the way, you'll consistently make an amazing cup of coffee that suits your personal preferences. Keep experimenting with different beans, ratios, and brewing methods until you find what works best for you and enjoys the perfect coffee every time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My mother left behind four younger siblings- the oldest 13, and the youngest 6. They couldn't live with their biological father for reasons I will not mention here (This is not my dad, my dad and their dad are different,) and seeing is my Aunt was the only next of kin, she decided to take my siblings in. Things are hectic, but quiet for the next few months. We have a private memorial service where I see my aunt and siblings, everything seems okay. Then, December rolls around. I plan a trip up to their house, which is two hours away from mine. We're driving my brother home and I ask, \\"Are you going to keep the kids?\\" She says no. Honestly? I was livid- but I understood. My siblings' father was a horrible man; they watched him and learned from him. They're very difficult to deal with, to the point where my mother couldn't even find babysitters because they just caused so many problems. It's not their fault, they're just kids, but they are...hard to deal with (One of my siblings sliced another open with a boxcutter once). Additionally, my Aunt already has a kid of her own, and she works third shift, AND her boyfriend was going to leave her if the kids stayed. I was angry, but I understood the stress that was put on her. I ask her to keep me updated, I message her every week or so, asking about the kids, I get vague responses. And then, a few months later, I get a letter. It's from CPS. My siblings were being placed in foster care. My aunt didn't tell me, she didn't let me know, she didn't tell me where they were going and how I can contact them. I just got a copypaste letter telling me my siblings were placed in foster care. And my aunt wants to come to my high school graduation. I only get four tickets. She has never been in my life, she has never gone out of her way to message me until my mom's death, and she didn't tell me what was happening with my siblings.

Information: - East Timor or Timor-Leste (Tetum: \\"Timór Lorosa'e\\"), officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, is a sovereign state in Maritime Southeast Asia. It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi). - Bushrangers were originally escaped convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who had the survival skills necessary to use the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities. By the 1820s, the term \\"bushranger\\" had evolved to refer to those who abandoned social rights and privileges to take up \\"robbery under arms\\" as a way of life, using the bush as their base. Bushranging thrived during the gold rush years of the 1850s and 1860s when the likes of Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert led notorious gangs in the country districts of New South Wales. These \\"Wild Colonial Boys\\", mostly Australian-born sons of convicts, were roughly analogous to British \\"highwaymen\\" and outlaws of the American Old West, and their crimes typically included robbing small-town banks and coach services. In other infamous cases, such as that of Dan Morgan, the Clarke brothers, and Australia's best-known bushranger, Ned Kelly, numerous policemen were murdered. The number of bushrangers declined due to better policing and improvements in rail transport and communication technology, such as telegraphy. Kelly's capture and execution in 1880 effectively represented the end of the bushranging era. - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean. The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is some east of northern Australia, northeast of New Caledonia, east of New Guinea, southeast of the Solomon Islands, and west of Fiji. - Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour, and sprawls towards the Blue Mountains to the west. Residents of Sydney are known as \\"Sydneysiders\\". Sydney is the second official seat and second official residence of the Governor-General of Australia and the Prime Minister of Australia and many federal ministries maintain substantial presences in Sydney. - Canberra (or ) is the capital city of Australia. With a population of 381,488, it is Australia's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), south-west of Sydney, and north-east of Melbourne. A resident of Canberra is known as a \\"Canberran\\". - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - Edward \\"Ned\\" Kelly (December 1854 11 November 1880) was an Australian bushranger of Irish descent. - Papua New Guinea (PNG Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. - Survival skills are techniques that a person may use in order to sustain life in any type of natural environment. These techniques are meant to provide basic necessities for human life which include water, food, and shelter. The skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over a period of time. Survival skills are often basic ideas and abilities that ancients invented and used themselves for thousands of years. Outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, and hunting all require basic wilderness survival skills, especially in handling emergency situations. Bushcraft and primitive living are most often self-implemented, but require many of the same skills. - A gold rush is a new discovery of gold that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune. Major gold rushes took place in the 19th century in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, South Africa and the United States, while smaller gold rushes took place elsewhere. - Telegraphy (from Greek: \\"têle\\", \\"at a distance\\" and \\"gráphein\\", \\"to write\\") is the long-distance transmission of textual or symbolic (as opposed to verbal or audio) messages without the physical exchange of an object bearing the message.

After being convicted under the alias Francis Melville , McCallum was transported to Tasmania ( then known as Van Diemen 's Land ) as a convict in 1838 , aged 15 , and left for Melbourne about October 1851 . During 1852 as Captain Melville he was alleged to have led a large band of bushrangers on the roads in the Black Forest between Melbourne and Ballarat , and gained a folkloric reputation through the boldness of his outrages and the chivalry he showed to many , especially women . His name was associated with the Nelson robbery and St Kilda Road robberies , probably without foundation as in reality he seems to have spent most of his time bailing up diggers around Mount Macedon , either on his own or with one or two mates . On Christmas Eve 1852 , when under the alias of Thomas Smith , he and fellow bushranger William Robert Roberts were arrested at a brothel in Corio Street , Geelong , and eventually faced Judge Redmond Barry at the Geelong Circuit Court on 3 February 1853 on three counts of robbery . Barry sentenced both men to twelve , ten and ten years on each count , respectively -- in Melville 's case to be served consecutively . Although employed in chains on the roads of Victoria by the time of the Melbourne Private Escort Robbery of 20 July 1853 , Captain Melville 's name has become associated with it over the years because of the coincidence of one of the Escort robbers , George Melville , using the same surname as his alias . In 1854 he was one of a party of prisoners based on the prison hulk Success in Port Phillip Bay who attempted to seize and escape in a boat , during which a warder was killed . Sentenced to death but reprieved , he was then sent to Old Melbourne Gaol , where he was found hanged in his cell on 10 August 1857 . - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The Victorian gold rush was a period in the history of Victoria, Australia approximately between 1851 and the late 1860s. - Brothers Thomas (c. 1840 25 June 1867) and John Clarke (c. 1846 25 June 1867) were Australian bushrangers from the Braidwood district of New South Wales. They were responsible for a series of high-profile robberies and murders which led to the embedding of the \\"Felons' Apprehension Act (1866)\\", a law that introduced the concept of outlawry and authorised citizens to kill bushrangers on sight. Active in the southern goldfields from 1865, Thomas, John, their brother James and several other relations were responsible for a reported 36 hold-ups and the deaths of five policemenfour of them bounty hunters looking to bring them in. Some modern-day writers have described the Clarkes as the most bloodthirsty bushrangers of all. They were captured during a shoot-out in April 1867 and hanged two months later at Sydney's Darlinghurst Gaol. Their execution ended organised gang bushranging in New South Wales. - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia. It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. It has a coast line with the Tasman Sea on its east side. The Australian Capital Territory is an enclave within the state. New South Wales' state capital is Sydney, which is also Australia's most populous city. , the estimated population of New South Wales was 7.5 million, making it Australia's most populous state. Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 4.67 million, live in the Greater Sydney area. Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\". - Frank Gardiner (1830 c. 1903?) was an Australian bushranger. Sources differ as to his origins. Some have him as a Currency Lad, native-born near Goulburn, New South Wales around 1830, others that he was Scottish-born, and migrated to Australia as a child with his parents in 1834. His real name was Francis Christie, though he often used one of several other aliases including Gardiner, Clarke or Christie. He supposedly took the name Gardiner after a man who lived for some years with his family and who had taught him how to ride and break in horses. He continued to use the surname Gardiner when he moved to the United States.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Visiting the Frugal Promised Land: Business Class No sooner had the captain turned off the “fasten seat belt” sign than the flight attendant on Air Pacific flight 411, headed from Fiji to New Zealand, performed the same dispiriting act I’ve seen dozens of times around the world: He drew together and Velcroed the flimsy gray curtains, separating the coach cabin from business class. This time, though, I smiled. In a few days, I’d be on the other side of that polyester divide, finding out what really goes on among the business consultants, rock stars and — I’m guessing — bejeweled countesses that sit up there. It’s not every day that a frugal traveler, let alone the Frugal Traveler, sits in business, so first a brief explanation. A credit card offer had netted me over 100,000 nearly free British Airways miles (mostly through a sign-up bonus), and I planned to use them to fly from New York to New Zealand and back via its partner Qantas, for the standard 80,000 miles. But British Airways miles are legendarily difficult to redeem, and this time was no exception. When I called the airline last October, I offered to fly any day in March — the off-season — with a flexible return time. To my astonishment, nothing was available. The next best alternative was to fly New York to Auckland, then back to Los Angeles, wait four days, and pay 25,000 extra miles (which I had, barely) to fly the rest of the way back to New York on another partner, American. There was a twist: only a business class seat was available. In my many years of flying, I had never sat in business class. Here, finally, was my chance. So, on a sunny April Friday at Los Angeles International Airport, I headed to my gate and right into the business class line, more excited, for once, to get on a plane than to get off. The advantages became apparent before boarding even started, when I was pointed not toward the regular, jampacked security line, but upstairs and into a disconcertingly friendly and rapid process. “Hello, how are you today, sir?” said a disturbingly smiley man, checking my ticket. “Have a wonderful flight.” I did still have to take off my shoes, but there was next to no line. I eased right through. A few paces down, our business class passenger tributary flowed into the rushing river of the harried coach classes. At the gate, another luxury: I’d be able to board early, before even the families traveling with small children and passengers needing special assistance. Was that a glint of jealousy I spotted in a toddler’s eye as I waltzed past him onto the ramp? I had never felt so alive. The seat: I was not expecting some masterpiece of design — this wasn’t Emirates or Singapore Airlines, after all — and indeed, it was not a thing of beauty. But it was big, with a luxuriously winged headrest, a mini-table in addition to the awkward fold-out tray table, and controls to move the seat every which way. I sat down and stretched my legs out … and out … and out some more until I practically fell off the seat. This was a morning flight, and though I don’t generally drink in the a.m. hours, there’s always room for an exception. Whom do you have to bribe to get some 11 a.m. Champagne around here? No one, it turns out: it arrived within moments. I sipped as I read the menu. Thai curry shrimp with couscous? Sounded good. Glenlivet Scotch? Nice, though a bit too high proof for this early in the day. I noticed we would soon be served “warm mixed nuts” – I had never thought of mixed nuts as heatable. I was a bit concerned that there was no screen, let alone a 15-inch LCD one, built into the seat in front of me. But no problem – we business-classers soon each received a Samsung tablet preloaded with plenty of movies, television shows and many other options I didn’t end up taking advantage of. An announcement came over the system: food was available for customers in coach. And yes, you could pay for that brisket sandwich with a credit card. Ah, how adorable, paying for food delivered in disposable plastic packaging. I envisioned my Thai curry shrimp arriving on actual china with actual silverware on an actual tablecloth. As it turned out, I underestimated American: it came on two tablecloths. The shrimp was just spicy enough, and it paired nicely with the chardonnay (lucky guess). The best part, however, was what came next – a choice between Ben & Jerry’s ice cream with marshmallows for dessert, or a cheese plate. I chose the ice cream. I would have asked for both, but that seemed like overkill, especially considering what came toward the end of the flight: warm cookies and cold milk. I was too stuffed to accept — but did anyway. Though I didn’t need to go to the bathroom, I was still excited to see what might be in store for me in the business class lavatory. Cinnamon-scented potpourri? Antique silver fixtures? Extra-plush Charmin? Alas, it was strikingly similar to the coach class lavatories, with one delightful exception: those in economy class weren’t allowed to use it, making for shorter lines. Most business class passengers must be as happy to land at their destination as those in coach. Not me. Might heavy air traffic force us to circle J.F.K. long enough to call for another round of Ben & Jerry’s? No. As a consolation prize, my ragged, ripped rolling suitcase, a priority tag contrasting with worn stickers from Turkish and Brazilian bus carriers, emerged first on the belt. On the subway ride home, I concluded that I saw the appeal: Roomy seats, smiling service, no lines, warm cookies. But what if I had been paying for a regular ticket? Later, I checked the prices on American’s Flight 40 over the next few weeks. The one-way coach price bounced around a bit, averaging 300. Business class was almost always 1,710. Some companies and wealthy people think that extra 1,410 is worth it; I’d guess most of the rest of us think it’s loony. A middle ground of fliers use miles they could use for additional free flights to upgrade to double-tablecloth land. To that, I say to each his own. I did, though, think back to a moment soon after our flight was aloft. Just as I was settling in to my new, temporary life of luxury, a flight attendant up ahead pulled shut the curtains separating my new friends in business class not from coach but from the real high rollers, in first class. What, what in the world, could be going on up there?","completion":"The Frugal Traveler discovered the appeal of business class during a flight with partner airlines British Airways, Qantas, and American, having accrued over 100,000 nearly-free miles through a credit card offer. After experiencing the significant difference between coach and business class services—including priority security lines, early boarding, spacious seats, preloaded Samsung tablets, and two-tablecloth catering—the author concluded that while some might find the 1,410 price difference worth it and others may consider it excessive, there's no denying the appeal of the business class experience."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the names of the two songs Saint-Saëns wrote during his career? From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The two song cycles Saint-Saëns wrote during his career were Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This premise provides information only about the existence of four L-shaped entrances decorated with flora, fauna, and Buddha symbols. It does not provide any information about T-shaped entrances. So, logically speaking, our steps, in this case, would be: 1) Review the provided premise: \\"Its circular balustrade has four L-shaped entrances with a simpler decoration of flora, fauna, and Buddha symbols.\\" 2) Identify critical details: This premise talks about four L-shaped entrances on a circular balustrade, further describing that these entrances are decorated. 3) Compare them with the given hypothesis: \\"There are 2 additional T-shaped entrances on the balustrade.\\" 4) Identify missing or uncorrelated information: The hypothesis speaks about two T-shaped entrances, which is completely new information. It is not mentioned or suggested in the premise. 5) Draw a conclusion: We can't confirm this hypothesis as true based on provided premise because it doesn't provide any information about T-shaped entrances.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this: While outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called aether. Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether (mythology)). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, astronomer Henry Pickering commented: \\"While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [it] is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there\\". Why were experiments done on luminiferous aether in the 19 Century? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Experiments on luminiferous aether were conducted in the 19th century primarily to investigate the properties and behavior of this hypothesized medium, which was thought to be responsible for the propagation of light and other electromagnetic waves in space. At the time, the scientific community widely accepted the existence of the luminiferous aether as it provided a plausible explanation for the transmission of light through apparently empty space. The concept of aether can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy, where it was considered as a pure and subtle substance that filled the empty spaces between celestial bodies. This idea evolved over the centuries, and during the 19th century, scientists postulated the existence of luminiferous aether, a medium that filled all of space and facilitated the transmission of light waves. The most famous of these 19th century experiments was the Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted in 1887 by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley. They sought to measure the relative velocity of the Earth through the aether, which they hypothesized would cause a detectable \\"aether wind.\\" The experiment involved splitting a beam of light and reflecting it off mirrors to recombine the beams, expecting a shift in the interference pattern due to the Earth's motion through aether. However, the results showed no significant interference shift, indicating that the expected relative motion between Earth and the aether was not present. These null results sparked further research and debate within the scientific community. Ultimately, these experiments, along with other observations, contributed to the development of Einstein's special theory of relativity in 1905, effectively displacing the notion of aether in favor of more accurate explanations of light propagation through space. Although the 19th century experiments on luminiferous aether did not yield the expected results, they played a crucial role in the advancement of modern physics by fostering scientific inquiry and shedding light on the processes governing the behavior of light and electromagnetic waves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Reg IV, a secreted protein and member of the Reg multigene family, is up-regulated in malignancies of the human gastrointestinal tract, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC). However, in vitro signal transduction pathway(s) utilized by Reg IV are not yet known.', 'To determine the signaling pathway(s) responsive to Reg IV, we examined the effects of purified recombinant human Reg IV (rhR4) on HCT116 and HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Addition of rhR4 to cultures led to a dose-dependent increase in cell number similar to that observed after treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). In addition, rhR4 treatment resulted in rapid phosphorylation of EGF receptor at Tyr992 and Tyr1068 and Akt at Thr308 and Ser473. Using luciferase reporter gene assays, we demonstrated that Reg IV signaling through EGF receptor and Akt results in increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor activity. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses revealed quantitative increases in c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and FosB expression associated with increased AP-1 activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay further revealed significant increases in AP-1 binding activity in rhR4-treated cells, with increased supershift in the presence of antibodies to JunB, JunD, and FosB. Furthermore, rhR4 treatments led to the increased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, survivin, and matrilysin, genes associated with a poor prognosis in advanced CRC. Answer: Reg IV is a potent activator of the EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in CRC. Disruption of Reg signaling may have utility as a therapeutic intervention for human gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. A:","completion":"Part 1: Construct a question based on the information present in the passage. Usage: What signaling pathway is Reg IV a potent activator of in colorectal carcinoma (CRC)? This question is based on the information provided in the passage and focuses on the role of Reg IV in CRC. Part 2: Make the question unambiguous. Usage: The same question from Part 1 (What signaling pathway is Reg IV a potent activator of in colorectal carcinoma (CRC)) is already unambiguous, as it clearly asks for the specific signaling pathway activated by Reg IV in CRC. Part 3: Ensure the question is answerable from the passage. Usage: The question asks about the signaling pathway, and the passage states, \\"Reg IV is a potent activator of the EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in CRC.\\" This directly answers the question as it highlights the signaling pathway involved. Part 4: The answer to the question should be unique. Usage: The answer \\"EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway\\" is unique because it is the only signaling pathway mentioned in the passage related to Reg IV's role in CRC. Part 5: The answer should use text phrases from the passage. Usage: The answer \\"EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway\\" directly uses text phrases from the passage, showing that it is based on the information provided in the context. Part 6: Avoid questions that can't be answered correctly without understanding the passage. Usage: The question (What signaling pathway is Reg IV a potent activator of in colorectal carcinoma (CRC)?) requires an understanding of the passage to answer correctly. If someone did not understand the passage, they would not be able to answer the question accurately. Part 7: Do not use the same words or phrases given in the passage when creating the question. Usage: The question (What signaling pathway is Reg IV a potent activator of in colorectal carcinoma (CRC)?) is phrased slightly differently from the passage and does not directly use the exact phrase \\"Reg IV is a potent activator of the EGF receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in CRC.\\" This allows for the question to test the reader's understanding without directly copying the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\". Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx.

This equation includes adding and subtracting terms and multiplying and dividing a variable, which in this case is d. Here are the steps to solve: First, take a look at the equation: 6d + 220 = -38d To start solving, we need to gather all 'd' terms on one side of the equation and the numeral terms on the other side. You might recognize that we can shift -38d on the left side of the equation, which makes the equation then: 6d + 38d = -220 We add the like terms on the left side: 44d = -220 Next, we'll isolate d on one side of the equation. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 44: d = -220/44 Finally, simplifying that fraction: d = -5 So, the solution to the equation 6d + 220 = -38d for 'd' is -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step-by-step explanation and justification: 1. A red giant burns mass: The star has exhausted its hydrogen fuel in the core and started consuming helium; this causes the star to expand. 2. This mass creates high core temperatures: When the star fuses elements such as helium, it produces energy and high core temperatures. 3. The mass decreases: As the star continues to burn away, its mass gradually decreases. 4. The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center: Once the helium is depleted, the core contracts, heats up, but eventually, the star lacks the temperature and pressure needed to ignite carbon and oxygen fusion. 5. The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers: As the core contracts, the outer layers are no longer gravitationally bound to the core. 6. The layers break away: The outer layers are expelled into space, forming a nebulous cloud called a planetary nebula. 7. Only the inner core remains: The core, no longer generating nuclear energy, remains. Final step: The inner core cools down and becomes a white dwarf. This is a hot, dense object supported by electron degeneracy pressure, which prevents it from collapsing further. Over time, the white dwarf will continue to cool, eventually becoming a black dwarf (although this stage has not yet been observed, as the Universe is not old enough)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They help to correct the irregular curve of your cornea and allow your retina to focus properly. Your optometrist will determine your glasses prescription so you can buy glasses to correct the astigmatism. Go to an eyeglasses store and try on glasses in person. Make sure the glasses feel comfortable when they sit on your nose and that they complement, rather than overwhelm, your face. You should feel confident when you wear them. If you want to buy eyeglasses online, you will need your prescription. Use a virtual try-on tool to see how the glasses will look on your face before you order them. Some eyeglass companies will offer to send you free samples of their frames so you can find the right one for you. Spray an eyeglass cleaner on the lenses and wipe them down with a smooth, dry cloth. Clean your glasses once a day, or several times a day, so your vision is not obscured by dust or dirt when you wear them. Keep your glasses in good condition by getting the screws in the arms tightened when needed. Your glasses should always sit flush against the sides of your face, with the arms on the glasses straight and even. Store your eyeglasses in a hard shell case to protect them and keep them in good repair. To correct astigmatism, you will need special toric contact lenses, rather than standard contact lenses. They are a good option if you don’t like wearing glasses all the time and you are comfortable putting contact lenses in your eye. Your optometrist may recommend contact lenses if you play a lot of sports or are very active and do not want to have to worry about wearing eyeglasses. Children 12 years and older can wear contact lenses. However, they may need the help of a parent to put them in. Wash your hands and then remove the contact from the case. Place it on your index finger. Pull your upper and lower eyelids away from your eye with the other hand. Carefully place the contact on your eye. Release your eyelid and blink to keep the contact in place. If you have trouble putting in the contact lenses, speak to your optometrist for guidance. It may take some practice to get the hang of it. Use a hard shell case to store the contact lenses and keep them in specialized cleaning solution. Look for cleaning solution made specifically for contact lenses at a medical supply store or online. Replace the cleaning solution every time you use the lenses so they stay clean. Get a new hard shell case every 3 months to ensure the lenses do not get dirty.

Know that you'll probably have to sacrifice some of your time and maybe effort to be your best friend. It should feel like something you want to be doing, even when it's hard. Invite other people to hang out with you. Being best friends doesn't mean you have to isolate yourselves from other people. Sometimes, it's nice to be alone; you don't need anybody else to have fun together. Other times, your enjoyment is increased by including other people into the fold.

Take time out of your day to appreciate the funny things in life. Nobody likes a best friend who just talks and talks but never listens. If you're a chatterbox, try to develop good listening skills.

Five double-digit seeded teams have won games with four games remaining in the second round. Even without a particularly mad March, the odds of picking all 63 games correctly are long. The chances of doing so was tabulated by a DePaul University math professor to be one-in-9.2 quintillion.

Quicken Loans, which is sponsoring and insuring the Buffet contest, said on its Twitter feed that it wouldn't reveal the number of entrants to the challenge. The pool was supposed to be capped at 15 million entries. It probably wouldn't have mattered if they had let more people join. At CBSSports.com, only 0.03 percent of entrants were still perfect after Mercer upset Duke. They didn't last much longer as Tennessee's rout of UMass wiped out all the remaining unblemished entries. It took 21 games to end everyone's hope of perfection this year. Last season it took 23 games and 24 in 2012. A year ago, not a single person of the 11 million who entered on ESPN's website was perfect after a first day filled with upsets. Just four got 15 out of 16 right. This year people lasted a little longer.

It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - \`\` Before Tomorrow Comes '' is a song by American hard rock band Alter Bridge and the third international , fourth overall , and final single taken from the band 's second album Blackbird .

The International intended to fight \\"by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State.\\" - In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin \\"\\", \\"common, universal\\") is the philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state. - The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, abbreviated in English as CPSU, was the founding and ruling political party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or Soviet Union). The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990, when the Congress of People's Deputies modified the article of the constitution which granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system. The party was founded in 1912 by the Bolsheviks (the majority faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party), a revolutionary group led by Vladimir Lenin which seized power in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. The party was dissolved on 29 August 1991 on Soviet territory soon after a failed coup d'état and was completely abolished on 6 November 1991 on Russian territory. - The Revolutionary Communist Party of Argentina ( Spanish : Partido Comunista Revolucionario de la Argentina ) is a Maoist communist party from Argentina . - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin ( 21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets. The new government called elections for the Constituent Assembly and... - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - Social democracy is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy, and a policy regime involving a commitment to representative democracy, measures for income redistribution, and regulation of the economy in the general interest and welfare state provisions. Social democracy thus aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic, egalitarian and solidaristic outcomes; and is often associated with the set of socioeconomic policies that became prominent in Northern and Western Europeparticularly the Nordic model in the Nordic countriesduring the latter half of the 20th century. - The October Revolution, officially known in the Soviet literature as the Great October Socialist Revolution , and commonly referred to as Red October, the October Uprising or the Bolshevik Revolution, was a seizure of state power instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917. It took place with an armed insurrection in Petrograd on 25 October (7 November, New Style) 1917.

The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\".

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON -- In a statement released Sunday, a Yale classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's said he is \\"deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Brett himself of his drinking at Yale.\\" Charles \\"Chad\\" Ludington, who now teaches at North Carolina State University, said he was a friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale and that Kavanaugh was \\"a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker.\\" \\"On many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption, not all of which was beer. When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive,\\" Ludington said. While saying that youthful drinking should not condemn a person for life, Ludington said he was concerned about Kavanaugh's statements under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \\"I have direct and repeated knowledge about his drinking and his disposition while drunk. And I do believe that Brett's actions as a 53-year-old federal judge matter,\\" Ludington said. \\"If he lied about his past actions on national television, and more especially while speaking under oath in front of the United States Senate, I believe those lies should have consequences. It is truth that is at stake, and I believe that the ability to speak the truth, even when it does not reflect well upon oneself, is a paramount quality we seek in our nation's most powerful judges.\\" Ludington also wrote about an occasion he and Kavanaugh socialized where it allegedly landed a mutual friend in jail. \\"On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi- hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man's face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail,\\" Ludington said. Meanwhile, FBI agents on Sunday interviewed one of the three women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as Republicans and Democrats quarreled over whether the bureau would have enough time and freedom to conduct a thorough investigation before a high-stakes vote on his nomination to the nation's highest court. The White House insisted it was not \\"micromanaging\\" the new one-week review of Kavanaugh's background but some Democratic lawmakers claimed the White House was keeping investigators from interviewing certain witnesses. President Trump, for his part, tweeted that no matter how much time and discretion the FBI was given, \\"it will never be enough\\" for Democrats trying to keep Kavanaugh off the bench. CBS News In speaking to FBI agents, Deborah Ramirez detailed her allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party in the early 1980s when they were students at Yale University, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of a confidential investigation. Kavanaugh has denied Ramirez's allegation. The person familiar with Ramirez's questioning, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said she also provided investigators with the names of others who she said could corroborate her account. But Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, has not been contacted by the FBI since Mr. Trump on Friday ordered the agency to take another look at the nominee's background, according to a member of Ford's team. Kavanaugh has denied assaulting Ford. Late Sunday, the Senate Judiciary Committee made public a previously unreleased interview with Kavanaugh from Sept. 26, before Ford and Kavanaugh openly testified Thursday. Kavanaugh denied all allegations against him and committee Democrats declined to ask questions, pointing out that the FBI should investigate. Speaking to the issue of the scope of the FBI's investigation, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said White House counsel Don McGahn, who is managing Kavanaugh's nomination, \\"has allowed the Senate to dictate what these terms look like, and what the scope of the investigation is.\\" \\"The White House isn't intervening. We're not micromanaging this process. It's a Senate process. It has been from the beginning, and we're letting the Senate continue to dictate what the terms look like,\\" Sanders said. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the investigation will be \\"limited in scope\\" and \\"will not be a fishing expedition. The FBI is not tasked to do that.\\" Senate Judiciary Committee member Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, requested an investigation last Friday -- after he and other Republicans on the panel voted along strict party lines in favor of Kavanaugh's confirmation -- as a condition for his own subsequent vote to put Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. Another committee member, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Sunday that testimony would be taken from Ramirez and Kavanaugh's high school friend Mark Judge, who has been named by two of three women accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. \\"I think that will be the scope of it. And that should be the scope of it,\\" Graham said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on the White House and the FBI to provide the written directive regarding the investigation's scope. In a letter Sunday, she also asked for updates on any expansion of the original directive. Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday she is confident in the investigation and \\"that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews.\\" The Maine Republican supports the new FBI investigation and is among a few Republican and Democratic senators who have not announced a position on Kavanaugh. Republicans control 51 seats in the closely divided 100-member Senate and cannot afford to lose more than one vote on confirmation. Collins and Flake spoke throughout the weekend. Senate Republicans discussed the contours of the investigation with the White House late Friday, according to a person familiar with the call who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, had gathered Judiciary Committee Republicans in his office earlier. At that time, the scope of the investigation was requested by Flake, Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said McConnell's spokesman Don Stewart. Murkowski is not on the committee, but also has not announced how she will vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation. Republicans later called the White House to discuss the scope of the probe, the person said. McConnell's office declined to elaborate Sunday on which allegations would be investigated, reiterating only that it would focus on \\"current credible allegations.\\" Stewart said the investigation's scope \\"was set\\" by the three GOP senators Friday and \\"has not changed.\\" But Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a Judiciary Committee member, doubted how credible the investigation will be given the time limit. \\"That's bad enough, but then to limit the FBI as to the scope and who they're going to question, that -- that really -- I wanted to use the word farce, but that's not the kind of investigation that all of us are expecting the FBI to conduct,\\" she said. Mr. Trump initially opposed such an investigation as allegations began mounting but relented and ordered one Friday. He later said the FBI has \\"free rein.\\" \\"They're going to do whatever they have to do, whatever it is they do. They'll be doing things that we have never even thought of,\\" Mr. Trump said Saturday as he departed the White House for a trip to West Virginia. \\"And hopefully at the conclusion everything will be fine.\\" He revisited the \\"scope\\" question later Saturday on Twitter, writing in part, \\"I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion.\\" Sanders said Mr. Trump, who has vigorously defended Kavanaugh but also raised the slight possibility of withdrawing the nomination should damaging information be found, \\"will listen to the facts.\\" At least three women have accused Kavanaugh of years-ago misconduct. He denies all the claims. The third woman, Julie Swetnick, accused Kavanaugh and Judge of excessive drinking and inappropriate treatment of women in the early 1980s, among other accusations. Kavanaugh has called her accusations a \\"joke.\\" Judge has said he \\"categorically\\" denies the allegations. Swetnick's attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Saturday that his client had not been contacted by the FBI but was willing to cooperate with investigators. Ford also has said Judge was in the room when a drunken Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. Judge has said he will cooperate with any law enforcement agency that will \\"confidentially investigate\\" sexual misconduct allegations against him and Kavanaugh. Judge has also denied misconduct allegations. ||||| That description was challenged by Chris Dudley, a former N.B.A. player and close friend of Judge Kavanaugh’s who attended Yale and played basketball with Mr. Ludington. Mr. Dudley said he was certain that he “never, ever saw Brett Kavanaugh black out” from drinking, and “never, ever saw him act inappropriately toward any woman in the 35 years that I’ve known him.” The dueling statements emerged as the political combat around Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process intensified. Democrats lashed out over the size and shape of the inquiry, saying it threatened to become a sham that would deepen, rather than help heal, the country’s divisions about Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. Senator Mazie K. Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said on ABC’s “This Week” that any investigation that limits whom the F.B.I. can interview and which leads agents can follow would be a “farce.” Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is also on the committee, described what she said was micromanaging from the White House: “You can’t interview this person, you can’t look at this time period, you can only look at these people from one side of the street from when they were growing up.” “I mean, come on,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Democrats were to some degree in the dark about the inquiry’s parameters. In a letter to Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee asked for a copy of the directive sent by the White House to the bureau laying out the scope of the investigation. “If the F.B.I. requests any expansion beyond the initial directive, please provide the names of any additional witnesses or evidence,” the Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, wrote in the letter. It is not unusual for the White House to specify the scope of a request for additional background information on a nominee. No evidence has emerged that the White House has forbidden any investigative steps, and President Trump has said he wants agents “to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion.” |||||","completion":"A Yale classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Charles Ludington, has alleged that Kavanaugh was a \\"frequent and heavy drinker\\" during their time at Yale and has been untruthful about his past drinking habits. Ludington also mentioned an incident involving Kavanaugh initiating a fight that led to a mutual friend's arrest. The statement comes amidst the ongoing FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's background, following accusations of sexual misconduct by multiple women.

This Caterer entirely ruined my sisters wedding yesterday. For a small 50 person wedding, the cost was ridiculous and even though they paid their bill in FULL months before the wedding, the caterer was still asking for money up until the day of the event. The Basic Cake clause in the contract was not explained well. The catering staff kept asking the family all night for a schedule of things even though it had been provided to them by the bride weeks earlier. They even cut the cake before the bridal couple cut the cake and were serving it during the toast! The food was cold, the displays were well done although very sparse, there was no butter provided for the rolls, salt and pepper was not provided and when asked for, was told that having salt and pepper available would be an insult to the chef. The staff was supposed to be at the hall at 2:30 PM and didn't show up until after the guests started arriving at 3:45 for a 4 PM wedding. Shameful, shameful.

However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.

There are subtle differences in the phrasing, but the core message remains the same. The first sentence is: \\"It was to fly a plane into the White House,\\" Karas said.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Titans got the second quarter lead as kicker Rob Bironas got a 42-yard field goal, along with quarterback Kerry Collins completing a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Justin Gage. The Steelers would respond with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santonio Holmes. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh took the lead as Roethlisberger completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward, yet Tennessee struck back with rookie running back Chris Johnson getting a 21-yard touchdown run. The Titans would then pull away in the fourth quarter with running back LenDale White's 1-yard touchdown run and safety Michael Griffin's 83-yard interception return for a touchdown. This was the first game of the year where the league-leading Steelers defense allowed more than 300 yards of total offense (allowing 332 yards).

Historically, they were experienced sailors and used stars to navigate during the night. - Waders are birds commonly found along shorelines and mudflats that wade in order to forage for food (such as insects or crustaceans) in the mud or sand. They are called shorebirds in North America (where \\"wader\\" is used to refer to long-legged wading birds such as storks and herons). Waders are members of the order Charadriiformes, which includes gulls, auks and their allies. - The Society Islands includes a group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean. It is, politically and legally, part of French Polynesia. The archipelago is believed to have been named by Captain James Cook during his first voyage in 1769, supposedly in honour of the Royal Society, the sponsor of the first British scientific survey of the islands; however, Cook, himself, stated in his journal that he called the islands \\"Society\\" \\"as they lay contiguous to one another.\\" - French Polynesia is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic; \\" (COM)\\", sometimes unofficially referred to as an overseas country; \\" (POM)\\".

A happy third degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent. \\"But every extra unhappy friend increases the likelihood that you'll be unhappy by 7 percent,\\" Fowler said. The finding is interesting and it is useful, too, Fowler said. \\"Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced mortality , pain reduction, and improved cardiac function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to develop a healthier society,\\" he said. The study also fits in with other data suggested in 1984 that having 5,000 extra increased a person's chances of becoming happier by about 2 percent. \\"A happy friend is worth about 20,000,\\" Christakis said. Question: What does Christakis mean by saying \\"A happy friend is worth about 20,000\\"? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Christakis means that the happiness a happy friend brings to your life has a similar impact on your overall happiness as receiving an extra 20,000 would. The value of a happy friend in terms of happiness gained is relatively equal to the increase in happiness that one might experience from a significant financial gain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited China's sole aircraft carrier on Monday in an unprecedented opening by normally-secretive Beijing to a potent symbol of its military buildup. A U.S. official said the visit to the carrier the Liaoning, at a port in the northern city of Qingdao, lasted about two hours. No other details were immediately available. The official believed Hagel was the first official visitor from overseas to be allowed on board the Liaoning in a sign that China is responding to U.S. criticism over it's lack of transparency regarding its growing weapons programme. The secretive visit comes days after the United States promised to send two missile defence ships to Japan to counter the growing threat from both North Korea and China. Lone mission: Escorted by Chinese military personnel, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel arrives at Qingdao International Airport in Qingdao. Growing power: The 60,000-tonne Liaoning, a Soviet-era vessel bought from Ukraine in 1998 and re-fitted in a Chinese shipyard, is seen as a symbol of China's growing naval power and ambition for greater global influence. Hagel's carrier visit, at the start of his three-day trip to China, was quietly approved by Beijing at Washington's request, the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 60,000-tonne Liaoning, a Soviet-era vessel bought from Ukraine in 1998 and re-fitted in a Chinese shipyard, is seen as a symbol of China's growing naval power and ambition for greater global influence. The carrier has yet to become fully operational, however, and military experts say it could be decades before China catches up to the far superior and larger U.S. carriers - if ever. Hagel arrived in Qingdao after a trip to Japan. Warm welcome: Hagel, left, is welcomed by Rear Admiral Guan Youfei, Director of Foreign Affairs Office of the Chinese Defense Ministry and U.S. Ambassador to China, Max Baucus. The carrier has yet to become fully operational, however, and military experts say it could be decades before China catches up to the far superior and larger U.S. carriers - if ever. Early this year the Liaoning completed. sea trials in the South China Sea. The official Xinhua News Agency said. the carrier tested its combat system, conducted a formation practice and 'attained the anticipated objectives.' Reporters travelling with Hagel did not accompany him on the vessel, in what is a rare visit to a sensitive Chinese military site. 'It's a sign of openness, of sincerity, that China has nothing to hide and wants to improve military relations with the United States,' said Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. 'It will also be a good opportunity for the Americans to see the difference between the Liaoning and their aircraft carriers,' Ni said, referring to the technological gulf between the two countries. Chinese military brass are no strangers to U.S. warships, including aircraft carriers. Officers from the People's Liberation Army are routinely flown to U.S. aircraft carriers en route to occasional port stops in Hong Kong, according to U.S. military officials. Their U.S. counterparts provide tours of the ship and flight deck during operations - efforts U.S. diplomats say are geared to nudging China towards greater transparency about its capabilities. Ian Storey, a Singapore-based regional security expert, said earlier that Hagel's visit would be 'long on symbolism but short on actual operational capabilities'. 'By showing him a vessel that was built in Ukraine in the 1980s and remains only a training platform that is still not fully operational, the Chinese will be keeping him away from their more sensitive capabilities, such as their missile programmes or submarine fleets,' said Storey, of Singapore's Institute of South East Asian Studies. Waging diplomacy: Hagel is on a 10-day trip to the Asia Pacific region and was leaving Japan today to travel to China. He is scheduled to meet with senior Chinese leaders before traveling to Mongolia, then returning home. China is building submarines, surface ships and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and has tested emerging technology aimed at destroying missiles in mid-air. The carrier visit came a day after. Hagel said he would use his first trip to China as defense secretary to. press Beijing to use its 'great power' wisely and respect its. neighbours, who have been put on edge by the country's growing. assertiveness in Asia's disputed waters. China. claims 90 per cent of the 1.35 million sq mile South. China Sea, which is believed to be rich in oil and gas. The. Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim parts of. those waters. China has a. separate dispute with Japan in the East China Sea over uninhabited. islets that are administered by Japan. China's decision in November to. declare an air defence identification zone in the area that includes. those islands sparked protests from the United States, Japan and South. Korea. The Liaoning would serve as a training platform rather than a fighting weapon, some Chinese experts have said. Considerable. doubt also remains over when it will be fully operational. Earlier. estimates of two or three years had grown rubbery, with some hints. internally that it could stretch to a decade, some experts say.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Every artist knows in his heart that he is saying something to the public. Not only does he want to say it well, but he wants it to be something that has not been said before. He hopes that the public will listen and understand ----he wants to teach them, and he wants them to learn from him. What visional artists like painters want to teach is easy to make out but difficult to explain, because painters translate their experience into shapes and colors, not words. They seem to feel that a certain choice of shapes and colors, out of the countless billions possible, is very interesting for them and worth showing to us. Without their work we should never have noticed these particular shapes and colors, or have felt the delight which they brought to the artists. Most artists take their shapes and colors from the world of nature and from human bodies in movement and at rest; their choices show that these aspects of the world are worth looking at, that they contain beautiful sights. Modern artists might say that they only choose subjects that provide an interesting pattern, that there is nothing more in it. Yet even they do not choose totally without thinking about the character of their subjects. If one painter chooses to paint a decaying leg and another a lake in moonlight, each of them is directing our attention to a certain aspect of the world .

Ishida Yoko does fine with the singing, but everything else was just cringe-inducing. Shame too, because she is one of my favorite Japanese singers. Is this product review negative? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, this product review is predominantly negative. The reviewer begins by indicating that the DVD was purchased years ago and was recently rediscovered on their shelf. Although they acknowledge that the concert starts as \\"poorly produced but ultimately harmless,\\" they go on to describe it as a \\"dreadful combination of overdone remixes and embarrassing para para dancing.\\" This clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the overall content and production of the DVD. Despite praising Ishida Yoko's singing performance, the reviewer repeatedly underscores the negative aspects of the DVD, describing it as \\"cringe-inducing\\" and expressing disappointment. The fact that Ishida Yoko is one of the reviewer's favorite Japanese singers further contributes to their frustration with the DVD, as it fails to live up to their expectations. From the detailed account provided by the reviewer, it is evident that their dissatisfaction isn't limited to one particular aspect but encompasses multiple elements of the DVD. Terms and phrases such as \\"dreadful,\\" \\"embarrassing,\\" and \\"cringe-inducing\\" amplify the negative tone of the review, and it is therefore safe to conclude that this product review is negative in nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the provided options, we can eliminate some of them based on their relevance to the facts given: - Sunlight: Sunlight is not a tangible food source and has no direct connection to mushrooms or fungi. - Fungus: Fungus is the singular form of fungi, but the fact indicates that humans have collected mushrooms, which belong to the fungi kingdom. Therefore, it is better to refer to fungi in this context. - Bread: While bread can be made with the help of yeast, which is also a fungus, it is not directly related to mushrooms, and thus, not the most suitable answer. - Salmon: Salmon is a type of fish and has no connection to mushrooms or fungi. - Dust: Dust is inorganic particulate matter and has no relevance to the facts given. - Plants: Although plants, like mushrooms, have been an essential food source for humans throughout history, they are a separate biological kingdom and are separate from fungi. Hence, based on Fact 1 and Fact 2 and the process of elimination, the appropriate answer to the question, \\"What have humans have collected and grown for food for thousands of years?\\" is fungi. The relationship between mushrooms being a type of fungi and their use as a food source by humans for thousands of years directly correlates with the given facts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

France started the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), and was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia and other German states. The end of the war led to the unification of Germany. Otto von Bismarck annexed Alsace and northern Lorraine to the new German Empire in 1871; unlike other members states of the German federation, which had governments of their own, the new Imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine was under the sole authority of the Kaiser, administered directly by the imperial government in Berlin. Between 100,000 and 130,000 Alsatians (of a total population of about a million and a half) chose to remain French citizens and leave Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen, many of them resettling in French Algeria as Pieds-Noirs. Only in 1911 was Alsace-Lorraine granted some measure of autonomy, which was manifested also in a flag and an anthem (Elsässisches Fahnenlied). In 1913, however, the Saverne Affair (French: Incident de Saverne) showed the limits of this new tolerance of the Alsatian identity.

Little Richard was born Richard Wayne Penniman on December 5, 1932, in Macon, Georgia. He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. In October 1985, Little Richard returned to the United States from England, where he had finished recording his album Lifetime Friend, to film a guest spot on the show, Miami Vice. Following the taping, he accidentally crashed his sports car into a telephone pole in West Hollywood, California. He suffered a broken right leg, broken ribs and head and facial injuries. His recovery from the accident took several months. His accident prevented him from being able to attend the inaugural Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in January 1986 where he was one of several inductees. He instead supplied a recorded message. In 2007, Little Richard was having problems walking due to sciatica in his left leg, requiring him to use crutches. In November 2009, he entered a hospital to have replacement surgery on his left hip. Despite returning to performance the following year, Little Richard's problems with his hip continued and he has since been brought onstage by wheelchair. He has told fans that his surgery has his hip \\"breaking inside\\" and refuses to have further work on it. On September 30, 2013, he revealed to CeeLo Green at a Recording Academy fundraiser that he had suffered a heart attack at his home the week prior and stated he used aspirin and had his son turn the air conditioner on, which his doctor confirmed had saved his life. Little Richard stated, \\"Jesus had something for me. He brought me through\\". On April 28, 2016, Little Richard's friend, Bootsy Collins stated on his Facebook page that, \\"he is not in the best of health so I ask all the Funkateers to lift him up.\\" Reports subsequently began being published on the internet stating that Little Richard was in grave health and that his family were gathering at his bedside. On May 3, 2016, Rolling Stone reported that Little Richard and his lawyer provided a health information update in which Richard stated, \\"not only is my family not gathering around me because I'm ill, but I'm still singing. I don't perform like I used to, but I have my singing voice, I walk around, I had hip surgery a while ago but I'm healthy.'\\" His lawyer also reported: \\"He's 83.

Early missionary attempts during the century after the Reformation did not succeed. However, European traders brought Lutheranism to Africa beginning in the 17th century as they settled along the coasts. During the first half of the 19th century, missionary activity in Africa expanded, including preaching by missionaries, translation of the Bible, and education. Lutheranism came to India beginning with the work of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg, where a community totaling several thousand developed, complete with their own translation of the Bible, catechism, their own hymnal, and system of Lutheran schools. In the 1840s, this church experienced a revival through the work of the Leipzig Mission, including Karl Graul. After German missionaries were expelled in 1914, Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous, yet preserved their Lutheran character. In recent years India has relaxed its anti-religious conversion laws, allowing a resurgence in missionary work. In Latin America, missions began to serve European immigrants of Lutheran background, both those who spoke German and those who no longer did. These churches in turn began to evangelize those in their areas who were not of European background, including indigenous peoples. In 1892, the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan. Although work began slowly and a major setback occurred during the hardships of WWII. Lutheranism there has survived and become self-sustaining. After missionaries to China, including those of the Lutheran Church of China, were expelled, they began ministry in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the latter which became a center of Lutheranism in Asia. The Lutheran Mission in New Guinea, though founded only in 1953, became the largest Lutheran mission in the world in only several decades. Through the work of native lay evangelists, many tribes of diverse languages were reached with the Gospel. Answer this question based on the article: Which happened later, the first Lutheran missionaries reaching Japan or the founding of the Lutheran Mission in New Guinea?","completion":"The founding of the Lutheran Mission in New Guinea happened later than the first Lutheran missionaries reaching Japan. According to the article, the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan in 1892. Meanwhile, the Lutheran Mission in New Guinea was only founded later in 1953. So, more than half a century passed between these two notable events in the history of global Lutheran missions. In more detail, there is a progression of Lutheran mission work in various regions over the centuries. The article outlines a timeline beginning with unsuccessful missions following the Reformation, moving then to the establishment of Lutheranism in Africa through European traders in the 17th century. The missionary activity there expanded throughout the first half of the 19th century which included evangelism, Bible translation, and education. Similarly, Lutheran missionary work started in India led by Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg where the community thrived remarkably, eventually resulting in their own translation of the Bible, catechism, hymnal, and Lutheran schools. In the 1840s, the Leipzig Mission led an influential effort. Although German missionaries were expelled in 1914 adherents managed to preserve their Lutheran identity. In Latin America, missions began to serve European immigrants of Lutheran background. These churches then extended their mission work to the people in their areas who were not of European descent. Ultimately, we see the expansion of Lutheranism in Asia from the arrival of the first Lutheran missionaries in Japan in 1892, to the establishment of the Lutheran Church in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Despite the difficulties experienced during World War II, Lutheranism in Japan has managed to persist and become self-sustaining. Lastly, we see the founding of the Lutheran mission in New Guinea in 1953. Although established relatively late, within just a few decades, it became the largest Lutheran mission in the world. The article indicates a rapid growth of the mission work in New Guinea, crediting the native lay evangelists for reaching many tribes of diverse languages with the Gospel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The captives cultivated cereals, produced oil and wine as Sangiovese and Procanico, there were poultry, pigs, and cattle farms. From 1884 until 1965, because of its dry climate, Pianosa hosted convicts from all over Italy who had been affected by tuberculosis. At the beginning of the 1900s, the population on the island was 21 civilians, 80 Polizia Penitenziaria, 40 soldiers, and 800 prisoners. The former President of the Republic of Italy Sandro Pertini became an inmate in 1932 for political reasons. During World War II, on 17 September 1943, Germans troops invaded Pianosa and occupied it; on 19 March 1944 French commandos landed on the island, and after a short firefight left again, taking away 40 prison guards as hostages; the following month an allied bomber attacked the island, killing six people. Answer this question based on the article: How many more prisoners were taken hostage than people killed in the bomber attack?","completion":"In the text, it says that 40 prison guards were taken as hostages, and 6 people were killed in the bomber attack. To find out how many more prisoners were taken hostage than people killed, we can subtract the number of people killed from the number of hostages taken: 40 hostages - 6 people killed = 34 So, 34 more prisoners were taken hostage than people killed in the bomber attack."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You may be able to carry your loved ones’ ashes with you as a carry on, or you may need to check the container with the rest of the checked baggage. Some airlines require cremated ashes to be transported via the cargo hold. If you have the option of several flights, call each airline individually and choose the one which suits your needs the best. Some countries have no restrictions or requirements for travelling with cremated ashes, while other countries will not allow them to enter the country at all. When you call the consulate or embassy, ask for a full briefing on travel requirements for cremated remains. Since legislation can change with short notice, and websites are not always updated right away, it’s best to call rather than to rely on information you find online. If for some reason you can’t arrange a flight that will allow you to bring the ashes with you, contact the funeral home that prepared the ashes and ask them to advise you on your next step. Some countries will only allow ashes to be sent to and from licensed funeral directors. If you’re travelling internationally, you may need the funeral director to handle the travel arrangements. Before you undertake a trip to scatter your loved one’s ashes, be sure you will be allowed to scatter their ashes in the intended spot. Ask for written permission if the destination is on private property, and be sure you know the restrictions if you plan on scattering the ashes in a national park or other protected area. In Yosemite National Park, for instance, visitors are allowed to scatter ashes as long as it’s away from the public and at least 100 yards (91 m) away from water.

To isolate the term with z, we need to move the constant term (15) to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 15 from both sides. -3*z = -15 (since 0 - 15 = -15) Step 3: Solve for the variable z. Now, we need to get z by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of z, which is -3. z = -15 / -3 Step 4: Calculate the value of z. z = 5 (since -15 / -3 = 5) So, the solution to the equation 0 = -3*z + 21 - 6 is z = 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today we are going to learn about a special group of people who are going to ride bicycles for a good cause. They want to help children who need support and care, and also remember a kind man named Sir Terry Wogan. Now, let's learn a bit more about Sir Terry Wogan. He was a wonderful person who worked on television and radio for many years. He did fun things like talking to interesting people and playing music. One of the amazing things he did was helping children who were not as lucky as others. He helped a program called Children in Need. This program collects money to help children in many different ways, like giving them a better home, or helping them when they are sick. Sadly, Sir Terry Wogan left us in 2016, but the program he cared about, Children in Need, keeps helping children and is still going strong. That's where our cyclists come in! These caring people want to do something special for Sir Terry Wogan and for all the children he helped. By riding their bicycles, they plan to raise money for Children in Need. These cyclists will not just ride their bikes anywhere. They are going to pay a unique tribute to Sir Terry Wogan. They want to draw a big picture in the shape of his face, by riding their bikes in a carefully planned route. This fun route in the shape of Sir Terry Wogan's face will be like a thank you card from them and everyone who supports their bike ride. So, remember our cyclists and their big hearts. They are working hard to make sure that Children in Need can keep helping kids who are facing tough times. It is amazing to see people come together and give a helping hand. Just like Sir Terry Wogan, we can all try to make a difference in someone's life by being kind and caring."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: WASHINGTON — The 2016 presidential campaign has begun with a bevy of candidates, a fund-raising blizzard — and a suddenly quickening debate over the United States’ system of benefits for older adults. The debate is surprising for two reasons. The popularity of entitlements for older Americans has always intimidated politicians interested in curbing them — all the more since President George W. Bush’s failed push to partly privatize Social Security a decade ago. Falling budget deficits, as the economy recovers, have tempered calls for austerity in Congress. But demographic reality and the dynamics of the fight for the White House have brought the issue to the surface. Republican contenders have floated ideas that include eliminating Social Security payments to the wealthiest retirees and replacing Medicare benefits with health-care savings accounts. Democrats, with an entirely different constituency, have begun talking about increasing benefits. The challenge of sustaining economic vitality while caring for aging populations is familiar across the industrialized world. The United States’ baby boom generation has just begun to retire. Social Security and Medicare consume more than 40 percent of federal spending. The trustees of the programs, beseeching lawmakers to shore up their finances, project that they will swell to 11.5 percent of the entire economy within 20 years, compared with 8.4 percent in 2013. Yet the debate in Washington has been frozen since President Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, failed to strike a “grand bargain” on tax and spending levels. The pressures of the presidential campaign have revived the conversation. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, badly wounded by scandal, chose the entitlement issue as a way to jump-start his prospects among conservative Republican primary voters. “It’s time to tell the truth about what we need to do,” he said in New Hampshire last month. His bracing proposal: Raise the retirement age, increase Medicare premiums for affluent retirees and eliminate Social Security payments to beneficiaries with 200,000 of other annual income. He’s hardly the only Republican talking about entitlements. The former Florida governor Jeb Bush embraced an increase in the Social Security retirement age soon after Mr. Christie did. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, wooing Tea Party activists, would go further. In addition to raising the Social Security retirement age, he wants to curb inflation increases in benefits and resurrect George Bush’s privatization plan. “He showed remarkable courage,” Mr. Cruz said in an interview. “Sadly, congressional Republicans ran to the hills and abandoned him.” Dr. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who entered the Republican contest this week, has offered the boldest idea. He wants to replace Mr. Obama’s national health care law with a system of individual, tax-preferred “health savings accounts.” He told me that those accounts could replace Medicare itself. “When people are able to see how much more freedom they will have, and how much more flexibility they will have, and how much more choice they will have,” he said, “I think it’s going to be a no-brainer.” Democrats are sure to attack that idea fiercely, and already they’re moving in the opposite direction. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has entered the Democratic race, has proposed higher benefits for the poorest Social Security beneficiaries. Few would be surprised if the other declared Democratic candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former first lady and secretary of state, embraces that step as well. Fresh debate won’t ensure that the next president and Congress can reach the deal on entitlement programs that has proved so elusive. The ideological polarization of 21st-century American politics has survived war, financial crisis and repeated appeals for compromise. There is overlap in some areas. Like Mr. Christie, Mr. Obama has proposed higher Medicare premiums for the affluent; like Mr. Cruz, he has expressed a willingness to accept curbs on inflation increases in Social Security benefits. And like Mr. Sanders, Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, has proposed higher minimum benefits for some poor retirees. The campaign is placing options on the table, whether Washington decides to seize them after the election or not.

Question: When we are building a computer if we want to add resistance we need more resistors or fewer resistors? Text: Increasing the number of resistors in a series circuit increases the overall resistance of the circuit. The answer to this question is:","completion":"When building a computer, if you want to add resistance, you would need more resistors. According to the provided text, \\"Increasing the number of resistors in a series circuit increases the overall resistance of the circuit.\\" Resistors are essential components in electronic circuits that control the flow of electrical current by having a specific resistance value. They are critical in helping to manage the proper functioning of electronic devices and ensure that they receive the correct voltage and current levels required for their operation. Adding more resistors in a series circuit is one way to increase the overall resistance. When resistors are connected in series, their individual resistance values add up together to provide the total resistance of the circuit. For example, if you have two resistors connected in series with a resistance of 10 ohms and 20 ohms, the total resistance in the circuit would be 30 ohms. Alternatively, you can also increase overall resistance by utilizing resistors with higher resistance values. For this, you can replace the existing resistors with ones that have a higher ohm value, which would cumulatively lead to a higher resistance value in the circuit. In conclusion, to add resistance when building a computer, you will need more resistors or can use resistors with higher resistance values. This is because increasing the number of resistors in a series circuit or using higher value resistors will result in an increased overall resistance in the circuit, ensuring that your computer's electronic components receive the right amount of voltage and current for their efficient operation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From October 1979, he became a leading member in a group of left-wingers planning to depose the right-wing caucus of Southwark councillors that controlled the Bermondsey Constituency Labour Party (CLP). At the CLP's AGM in February 1980, the left group won control and Tatchell was elected Secretary. When the sitting Labour MP, Bob Mellish, announced his retirement in 1981, Tatchell was selected as his successor. The selection was a surprise, as Arthur Latham, a former MP and former Chairman of the Tribune Group, was the favourite. Later, the Militant group was cited as the reason for Tatchell's selection, but he has said that it had only a handful of members at that time in the constituency; he had never been a member and Militant did not support his selection. Tatchell ascribed his selection to the support of the \\"older, 'born and bred' working class; the younger professional and intellectual members swung behind Latham\\". Due to Tatchell's support for direct action in the London Labour Briefing newsletter, Tatchell was denounced by party leader Michael Foot for allegedly supporting extra-parliamentary action against the Thatcher government; according to Tony Benn, Foot lied about Tatchell's alleged extremism in order to allow the Social Democratic Party to rejoin the Labour Party. Neil Kinnock stated that the whole affair was a matter of political judgement, asking \\"the question is: are we talking of extra-parliamentary or anti-parliamentary behaviour?\\" The fact that Tatchell was a gay man was also considered by some as a factor as to why Tatchell should not be supported.

Howard Duane Allman (November 20, 1946 - October 29, 1971) was an American guitarist, session musician, and co-founder and leader of the Allman Brothers Band until his death following a motorcycle crash in 1971, at the age of 24. The Allman Brothers Band was formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1969. The band had great success in the early 1970s. Allman is best remembered for his brief but influential tenure in the band and in particular for his expressive slide guitar playing and inventive improvisational skills. The limits of full-time session playing frustrated Allman. The few months in Muscle Shoals were by no means a waste, however; besides meeting the great artists and other industry professionals with whom he was working, Allman had rented a small, secluded cabin on a lake and spent many solitary hours there refining his playing. Perhaps most significantly, Allman got together with R&B and jazz drummer Jaimoe Johanson, who came to meet Allman at the urging of Otis Redding's manager, Phil Walden, who by then was managing Allman and wanted to build a three-piece band around him. Allman and Jaimoe got Chicago-born bassist Berry Oakley to come up from Florida and jam as a trio, but Oakley was committed to his rock band with guitarist Dickey Betts, the Second Coming, and returned south. When asked how the band came together Duane responded with an astounding answer. \\"Very slowly, I was in Muscle Shoals and I went down to Jacksonville and was jamming with Berry and Dicky.

Greg was in California and Butch was in Jacksonville where we all got together and jammed for a couple of months putting together songs and stuff. After that we went up to New York and recorded there. We never played a gig before we cut our first album.\\" While living in Macon, Allman met Donna Roosman, who bore his second child, Galadrielle. The couple's relationship soon ended. He had an earlier relationship with Patti Chandlee which resulted in the birth of a daughter who was born deaf. Where did they start performing?","completion":"The Allman Brothers Band started performing in Jacksonville, Florida, where they initially came together as a group. After spending some time jamming and creating songs, they decided to move up to New York for their first recording. It was in New York where they recorded their first album, \\"The Allman Brothers Band,\\" released in 1969. However, it was in the American South and along the Eastern seaboard where the band made a significant impact on the music scene. They began gigging in various clubs, gaining a reputation for their powerful live performances characterized by extended jams and impressive interplay between the musicians. The band's breakthrough came when they played at the Atlanta International Pop Festival in 1970, performing in front of a large audience and significantly raising their profile. Soon after, they started to attract attention from promoters and concert-goers alike, resulting in numerous bookings across the country. The Allman Brothers Band went on to perform at various iconic venues like the Fillmore East in New York City, where they recorded their seminal live album \\"At Fillmore East\\" in 1971. Throughout their career, the band continued to tour extensively, earning a dedicated fan base that followed them from show to show. Despite the tragic loss of Duane Allman in 1971 and the subsequent lineup changes, the Allman Brothers Band remained an influential force in the music industry for decades, fusing rock, blues, and Southern soul into a distinctive sound that helped define the Southern Rock genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The roof collapsed under the weight of the meteor strike, but the floor stood firm, since the floor was so rugged. This surprising durability showcased the impressive quality of the materials and construction methods used by the builders, and even more remarkably, the floor was able to withstand the brunt of the impact without giving in. The rugged nature of the floor could be attributed to various factors, such as material choice, engineering techniques, and reinforcement strategies employed during the construction process. The structural soundness of the floor amidst such an extraordinary event emphasizes the importance of meticulous design and planning in creating lasting and resilient infrastructure capable of withstanding unexpected disasters. Additionally, this outcome highlights the need for research and development in stronger, more sustainable materials and construction methodologies that can better protect built environments in the face of extreme events.

Ted's dreams of roughing it on the savannah are squashed when Jean leads him into a house that looks like it belongs in Pasadena, California. Although Jean forbids her children to explore, Ted and Susan sneak out to a nearby watering hole to meet with a Masai tribal boy named Morogo. Morogo shows the siblings the wildlife of Kenya and they show him how to play video games. One day, Jean comes home to discover Morogo in her home. Ted and Susan plead with their parents to let Morogo be their guide and the parents reluctantly give in. One day, Ted kicks a soccer ball over a barrier and it lands against a sleeping rhino. Morogo sneaks up on the animal, retrieves the ball, and places a small stone on the rhino's side. He then gives Ted another stone, daring him to do the same. The rhino awakens as Ted nears, causing him to flee. A laughing Morogo tells him that a person must approach a rhino downwind or it will smell him. Kipoin, Morogo's father, is displeased his son is keeping company with Americans, because they are \\"cattle eaters\\" and is even more disgusted to learn they eat fish.

Place your index finger in front of it, say “up,” and give it a treat every time it steps up. Practice this even when you aren’t putting it back in the cage, so it doesn’t assume that step up practice will translate into going back into the cage. In fact, sometimes you should put it in the cage and let it come back out, so that it does not know for sure that returning to the cage translates into a prolonged period of enclosure. You can try practicing with things other than your finger, includes sticks. Ladders can be particularly useful because birds naturally like to walk up them. Training your bird to do this can be an easy way to get them back into the cage. Because birds like to move upward, your bird will often grow fonder of this trick if you begin to lift your finger slowly after it steps up. Some people recommend that you perform this procedure every time you return your bird to its cage. The idea is that, if you allow it to fly back on its own volition it might come to believe that it sets its own schedule for outside time. Once you have it on your index finger, you need to secure your bird so that it can’t fly off, but also so that it is still comfortable. One way to do this is to press your thumb lightly against your index finger, securing the birds feet to your finger. Alternatively, you can hold your other hand over its back gently, so that it will not be able to extend its wings out. You should practice these positions during regular training, so that your bird becomes accustomed to them and does not anticipate that it means a return to the cage. Also, if it becomes second nature, you will be less likely to forget to secure it and allow it to fly off when it is someplace foreign or dangerous. If you are having trouble controlling your bird, you can have its wings trimmed, permitting it to fly only a little or not at all, depending on how short they are clipped. This can, however, be counterproductive, because your bird will not tire itself outside of the cage and might be less willing to return. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article is about teaching your bird to step up on your finger and go back into its cage. It suggests using treats, practicing often, and trying different things like sticks and ladders.

You can also try holding the bird in different ways so it's secure but still happy.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Senate Torture Report Creates Few Ripples in Europe Europe wasn’t exactly silent. But considering the scale of the abuses that the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee revealed on Tuesday in its report on CIA torture, one might have expected a bit more outrage from the leaders of the Old World. Instead, the most common reaction was to praise the report as a sign of American transparency and accountability—two of the values meant to bind the West together—while many European statesmen have so far avoided saying anything at all. That includes the leaders of France and Germany, who made no public reaction in the 24 hours that followed the report’s release. British Prime Minister David Cameron only mentioned it while on a visit to Turkey on Wednesday when a reporter asked him for a response. “I’m satisfied that our system is dealing with all of these issues,” Cameron said. The practice of torture, he confidently added, is “wrong.” The most prominent sign of European contrition came from Poland, whose former President finally admitted during a press conference on Wednesday that his country hosted one of the CIA’s “black sites,” or secret prisons, where the abuse of detainees occurred. The U.S. had asked Poland “to find a quiet place, where effective measures could be taken to obtain information,” said Alexander Kwasniewski, who served as President from 1995 to 2005. Poland had consented to the request, he added, without knowing that the “quiet place” could be used for torture. He did not clarify the year when the facility was shut down. But the prevailing sentiment among Europe-watchers was that these revelations were considered old news. “All of this was ten years ago,” explains Constanze Stelzenmueller, an expert on European politics at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. “What’s striking is that the Americans are now really trying to do a reasonably honest and non-partisan accounting of what happened.” That American admission of guilt, and the integrity it required, did not go unnoticed even in some of the most damning editorials published in the mainstream European press. “The United States makes mistakes, sometimes terrible ones,” read an editorial in Der Spiegel, Germany’s leading newsmagazine. “But it has the strength to acknowledge it and learn from it.” The muted reaction from European leaders, says Stelzenmueller, is perhaps best explained by the dilemma this issue presents. If one of them praises the report’s transparency, they could be perceived as downplaying the gravity of the crimes committed in the execution of the war on terror. If one of them condemns those crimes, they will almost certainly face questions about their own country’s complicity, if not also its direct involvement, in torture and illegal detention. “The risk of the follow-up question is in any case greater than the political gains,” Stelzenmueller says. But that did not stop some European politicians from using the report as political ammunition. In Germany, the co-chairman of the opposition Left Party, Bernd Riexinger, called for Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to resign over the revelations. He also demanded Berlin rethink its cooperation with the U.S. on matters of intelligence. “I see no basis for cooperation with torturers,” Riexinger, whose party controls about 10% of the seats in the German parliament, told the Handelsblatt newspaper. The Foreign Minister, who also held the position from 2005 to 2009, did not deign to respond to the remarks, though he did issue one of the harsher condemnations against the CIA’s torture practices to issue from the European leadership. “What was then considered right and done in the fight against Islamic terrorism was unacceptable and a serious mistake,” Steinmeier told the German daily Bild, adding that the CIA’s activities amounted to a “gross violation of our liberal, democratic values.” But experts still saw no real chance of the report forcing Berlin or any other major European power to question their transatlantic ties. The reason, says Joerg Forbrig, an expert on Central and Eastern Europe at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, has to do with the ongoing standoff with Russia over Ukraine, which has urged the West to band together against what they perceive as a common threat to their security. “The key ingredient to any successful Russia policy is Western unity,” he says. And as German Chancellor Angela Merkel pursues an ever tougher line against Moscow, “She needs to rally the Europeans, and she needs to make sure the coordination with the Americans remains intact.” So if the White House was expecting the Senate report to freeze relations across the Atlantic, it can probably breathe a sigh of relief. Read next: Here’s What the CIA Actually Did in Interrogations Summary:","completion":"The release of the US Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA torture generated mixed reactions in Europe. While some leaders praised the report as a sign of American transparency and accountability, others avoided commenting on the issue. Former Polish President, Alexander Kwasniewski, admitted that Poland had hosted a CIA \\"black site\\" or secret prison where detainee abuse occurred. The muted reaction from some European leaders may be attributed to the delicate balance between acknowledging the report's transparency and the risk of questions regarding their own country's complicity in past torture and illegal detention."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer's experience and their evaluation of the product can be broken down into several aspects, which provide useful information in making a decision: 1. Functionality: The reviewer confirms that the replacement ignitor system works as intended, which is a positive aspect. Since the primary purpose of the product is to replace an existing part, it appears that it meets the user's expectations on this front. 2. Ease of installation: According to the reviewer, the installation process was as easy as expected. This is an important factor for many customers who may not have advanced technical skills, as it means they can replace the part without facing frustration or needing professional help. 3. Quality: The reviewer assesses the quality of the replacement ignitor system as being slightly better than the part it replaced. This indicates a level of improvement in the product, which is a favorable sign for potential buyers. 4. Durability: The user estimates that the product should last somewhere between 5-7 years, based on their experience with the previous part. While this might not be an outstanding lifespan, it can be seen as a reasonable period, especially considering the current era of rapid technological changes, where products do tend to become obsolete relatively quickly. 5. Price: The reviewer does not mention the price of the product, which may be an important factor to consider for some buyers. However, if the product is reasonably priced, the other positive aspects could still make it a worthwhile purchase. To sum up, the review highlights several positive aspects of the replacement ignitor system, including its functionality, ease of installation, and quality, which are important factors to consider when purchasing such a product. Although the expected lifespan might not be exceptionally long, it appears to be reasonable within the context of today's rapidly evolving technologies.

During the storm, they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur), returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets, both men are alarmed, but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod, a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation, which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage. They are suspicious of Queequeg but he shows his marksmanship with the harpoon and they gladly accept him at 1/300 fraction, where Ishmael only gets 1/600.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of the characters who have a relationship with a considerable amount of sexual tension? In Springberry, Alabama, 1946, young Dewey Cox accidentally cuts his brother Nate in half with a machete. The trauma causes Dewey to lose his sense of smell. Dewey meets a blues guitarist, who discovers Dewey is a natural musician. In 1953, after a successful talent show performance, 14-year-old Dewey leaves Springberry with his 12-year-old girlfriend Edith; they soon marry and have a baby. Working at an all-African American nightclub, Dewey replaces singer Bobby Shad onstage and impresses Hasidic Jewish record executive L'Chaim. While recording a rockabilly rendition of \\"That's Amore,\\" Dewey is berated by an executive. A desperate Dewey performs \\"Walk Hard,\\" a song inspired by a speech he gave Edith, which restores the executive's belief in Judaism and rockets Dewey to superstardom. The song becomes a hit within 35 minutes, and Dewey becomes caught up in the rock-and-roll lifestyle. Dewey is introduced to marijuana by his drummer Sam, and becomes unfaithful to Edith. Dewey's father informs him that his mother has died while dancing to Dewey's song, and blames Dewey's music for her death. Distraught, Dewey finds Sam using cocaine and partakes, resulting in a cocaine-fueled punk rock performance. Choirgirl Darlene Madison enters Dewey's life, and he produces several hit records amid their courtship laden with sexual tension. He weds Darlene while still married to Edith, which leads to both women leaving him, and purchases drugs from an undercover cop. After he serves time in prison and in rehab, Darlene returns. Answer:","completion":"The full names of the characters who have a relationship with a considerable amount of sexual tension are Dewey Cox and Darlene Madison."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Picking up a few key phrases could help you to communicate better, and might even help the vendor warm to you. Someone who has made the effort to learn a little bit of the language might be taken more seriously than a more obviously clueless foreigner. Knowing a few phrases could also help you understand what is going on around you, and find out what sort of prices other people are paying. Some good phrases to start with include: Duō shǎo qián – how much money. Jià gé – price, cost. Tài gui le! – too expensive! Pian Yi Dian? – can you give me this for cheaper? If you are struggling to understand each other, writing down numbers or entering them onto a calculator is a good idea. The vendor will almost certainly have a calculator and pen and paper at hand for precisely this purpose. It’s probably not a good idea to use your phone for this. Pulling out an expensive phone will be displaying your wealth and may prompt the vendor to look for a higher price. If you don’t have a language in common with the vendor you will have to rely on body language and gestures. This can be easier than you think, with a simple shake of the head an easily recognisable sign that you are not paying that price. Try to be open and friendly, rather than closed off and prickly. They might be trying to take rip you off, but it’s nothing personal. Unless you’re buying something very expensive, the actual difference in price when converted back to your home currency is probably not that significant. Don’t feel bad if the vendor seems offended by your low price offer, it’s all part of the melodrama of haggling in China.","completion":"Learning a few key phrases and using non-verbal communication can improve your bargaining experience and help you avoid overpaying at Chinese markets."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The town is an important tourist destination known as Zell am See-Kaprun and is a transportation hub for the region. - A ski is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow. Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski. - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - A piste is a marked ski run or path down a mountain for snow skiing, snowboarding, or other mountain sports. - The Ski Amadé region of Austria is a network of 28 ski areas and towns that combined, make up the second largest ski area in Europe.

In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets.

Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - International Ski Federation (FIS; short for Fédération Internationale de Ski) is the world's highest governing body for international winter sports. Founded in 1924, it is responsible for the Olympic disciplines of Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined, freestyle skiing and snowboarding. The FIS is also responsible for setting the international competition rules. The organization now has a membership of 118 national ski associations and is based in Oberhofen am Thunersee, Switzerland. - An international airport is an airport that offers customs and immigration facilities for passengers travelling between countries.

Options: A. lakes B. shore line C. shallow waters D. tidepools E. atlantic ocean A:","completion":"B. Shore line A crab must typically cross the shore line to reach the ocean. The shore line is the boundary where a body of water meets the land, and it is in line with common sense because it is the most straightforward way for a crab to access the ocean from its habitat. Shorelines can include sandy beaches, rocky coasts, and various other coastal environments that crabs can traverse to reach the ocean. While some of the other options might also be related to a crab's journey to the ocean or its habitat, they are not in line with common sense as direct answers to the question: A. Lakes: While crabs can sometimes be found in or near lake environments, they are not a primary habitat for crabs, which are mainly saltwater creatures. To get from a lake to the ocean, the crab would first need to navigate other bodies of water or land areas, and so \\"lakes\\" does not represent the most direct or common sense answer to the question. C. Shallow waters: Crabs may indeed be found in shallow water areas such as tidal flats and estuaries, but these environments are already part of the ocean. Thus, shallow waters do not accurately describe the path a crab must cross to reach the ocean itself. D. Tidepools: Tidepools are small bodies of water that formed along the shoreline during low tide. While crabs may sometimes inhabit tidepools, these pools are already part of the shoreline and are not representative of the full path a crab needs to cross to reach the ocean. E. Atlantic Ocean: The Atlantic Ocean is a specific body of water that some crabs must cross to reach the ocean. However, it is not a universal answer applicable to all crabs as there are numerous other oceans and bodies of water where crabs can be found. Furthermore, the Atlantic Ocean is part of the ocean itself, not the path that a crab must cross to reach the ocean. Therefore, considering all the options, the shore line (option B) is the most common-sense answer to the question of what a crab must cross to reach the ocean."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Q: What kind of weathering changes the size of a mineral or rock but does not change its chemical composition? A: A:","completion":"The kind of weathering that changes the size of a mineral or rock but does not change its chemical composition is called physical weathering. Step 1: Define the two types of weathering There are two main types of weathering: physical (or mechanical) weathering and chemical weathering. Physical weathering involves the breaking down of rocks and minerals into smaller pieces without altering their chemical composition, while chemical weathering involves the decomposition or alteration of the rock's minerals due to chemical reactions. Step 2: Explain the processes of physical weathering Physical weathering can be caused by various processes such as: 1. Freeze-thaw or frost action: When water enters cracks in rocks and freezes, it expands, putting pressure on the surrounding rock and causing it to break apart. 2. Thermal expansion and contraction: Fluctuations in temperature can cause rocks to expand and contract, resulting in the formation of cracks and the eventual fragmentation of the rock. 3. Pressure release: Rocks formed deep within the Earth's crust may experience a reduction of pressure when exposed at the surface, which can lead to the rock breaking apart. 4. Abrasion: Physical weathering can also occur through abrasion, where particles carried by wind, water, or ice scrape against rocks, breaking off smaller fragments. 5. Biological activity: The growth of plant roots and the burrowing activities of animals can exert pressure on rocks and cause physical weathering. By understanding these processes, it becomes clear that physical weathering is responsible for the disintegration of rocks and minerals while maintaining their original chemical composition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It takes the moisture out of the air and makes the room less humid or more dry. 3). open a window - This option might not necessarily make the room more humid. If the outside air is less humid than the room, opening a window would actually make the room less humid. If the outside air is more humid, then opening a window might help, but we can't be certain. 4). hope it rains - This is not a reliable option because we can't control the weather.

It is a highly competitive plant that can grow up to 6.5 feet tall with broad, lance-shaped leaves and large, purple-tinted seed heads. The plant is known to be highly persistent in different environments, making it difficult to control. Oklahoma is part of the Great Plains, an area of the United States encompassing portions of the central and southern regions of the country. The climate and various ecosystems in Oklahoma, such as the small mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, can contribute to the growth and proliferation of invasive species like Johnsongrass. The state's diverse topography and potential for severe weather may also play a role in the spread and establishment of invasive plants. Control measures for Johnsongrass in Oklahoma include cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods, such as mowing, tillage, herbicides, and establishing competitive vegetation cover. Early identification and an integrated approach to management are essential for successfully controlling this invasive species and minimizing its impact on native ecosystems and agricultural lands in Oklahoma."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Which entity is this text about? The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" - part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor - has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month. Another program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane. A similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians. The American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008), Janis Joplin (2009), Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011), and Chuck Berry (2012).","completion":"This text is about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Question: Who, in the Old Testament, sold his birthright for a piece of bread and a potage of lentils? Answer:","completion":"In the Old Testament, it was Esau who sold his birthright to his younger brother, Jacob, for a piece of bread and a potage of lentils. This significant event can be found in the book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 25, verses 29-34. Esau and Jacob were the twin sons of Isaac and Rebekah, but Esau was born first, making him the rightful heir to his father's inheritance and blessings. Esau was known as a skillful hunter and was favored by his father, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home and was favored by his mother. One day, after coming back from hunting, Esau was extremely famished. He found Jacob preparing a red lentil stew, also called \\"red pottage.\\" Esau requested Jacob to provide him with some of the stew, disregarding the consequences of his actions. Jacob saw this as an opportunity to acquire the birthright and cleverly struck a deal with his desperate brother. He agreed to give Esau the stew only if Esau sold his birthright to him. Esau, driven by his hunger and unable to grasp the magnitude of the consequences, accepted the offer. He swore an oath to sell his birthright and, in exchange, received the lentil stew and bread from Jacob. Esau's impulsive decision manifested his lack of concern for the divine and spiritual responsibilities that came with being the firstborn. The Bible states that Esau \\"despised his birthright\\" (Genesis 25:34) as he willingly traded it for a meal, highlighting how he prioritized immediate physical gratification over his long-term spiritual inheritance. The story of Esau selling his birthright for a piece of bread and a potage of lentils serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of impulsive decision-making and failing to recognize the importance of spiritual values. Eventually, Jacob went on to become the ancestor of the twelve tribes of Israel, founding a nation with a covenant relationship with God. On the other hand, Esau's descendants became the Edomites, a nation that struggled with Israel and ultimately faded from prominence. This story is a critical turning point in biblical history, as it defined the chosen lineage through which the promises made to Abraham and Isaac would be fulfilled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Searching for a legendary antique sword that once belonged to his late grandfather, Brad reunites with Uncle Ted and, together, they face the unspeakable threats lurking in the shadows to safeguard their family's powerful legacy. Act 1: Discovery and Reunion When Brad stumbles upon a hidden journal belonging to his late grandfather, an esteemed historian and archaeologist, he reads about an ancient, luminous sword adorned with precious gemstones, which possesses the ability to harness energy from the moonlight and wield unimaginable power. Intrigued by this family secret and encouraged by his best friend and fellow adventurer, Jane, Brad attempts to contact his estranged Uncle Ted, who allegedly has possession of the artifact. Upon meeting Brad, Uncle Ted, a retired treasure hunter, initially dismisses his nephew's quest, believing the sword to be too dangerous in the wrong hands. However, as their bond strengthens, he is eventually persuaded to reveal the sword's hidden location in their family's ancestral estate. Act 2: The Sword and the Unexpected Darkness With Uncle Ted's guidance, Brad uncovers the sword in a secret chamber, only to realize that the sword's luminous energy has been dwindling. Uncle Ted reveals that the sword's energy can no longer be sustained by the moonlight alone, and they must journey to an ancient temple in a remote region of Asia to restore its power. The duo, along with Jane, embark on their odyssey, facing treacherous terrain and life-threatening experiences. Along the journey, they meet a mysterious, nomadic tribe, the Rashaì, whose leader, Amana, is an ally of their late grandfather. With her knowledge of the sword's origin and the sacred temple's location, Amana agrees to guide them on their journey in exchange for a favor—to keep the sword safe from an evil organization known as the 'Lunar Serpents,' led by the ruthless and power-hungry Marcus Draken. Act 3: The Final Battle and the Passing of the Legacy The adventurers, now a team of four, reach the sacred temple and perform the ritual to restore the sword's power. As they succeed, Marcus Draken and the Lunar Serpents ambush them, resulting in a fierce confrontation. Uncle Ted, using his long-hidden combat skills, fights off the attackers while urging Brad, Jane, and Amana to escape with the sword. As Brad witnesses his uncle's ordeal, he reluctantly heeds his instructions, promising to protect the sword and avenge his fallen relative. Armed with renewed purpose and the support of his newfound friends, Brad embraces his destiny as the guardian of the luminous blade. The film concludes with Brad, Jane, and Amana establishing an alliance with the Rashaì and setting out on new global adventures to uncover ancient artifacts and protect them from the forces of darkness such as the Lunar Serpents. Although Uncle Ted ultimately loses his life, he passes on his legacy and wisdom to Brad, uniting the family under a shared calling once again."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Title: Died in 2 months Review: This is the worst laptop cooler I've ever had. My laptop has heat damage (thanks to my roommate first semester of college), therefore I can't run it without a fan unless I want to crash in the space of 2 hours. I've gone through a number of different laptop coolers/ fans and this has been the worst. First of all, It has no protection for the fans at all, to the point that I have to find a large book or something like that to set the cooler on so that I can use my laptop in my lap and not get the fans caught on my clothing. That was a huge annoyance, but something I could deal with. Then it turns out that the cooler ends up dying on me in 2 months or less after I purchased it. Yuck!! Is the review positive or negative?","completion":"Step 1: Read and understand the content of the review - The user shares their experience with the laptop cooler - They mention multiple issues they faced with the product Step 2: Identify the sentiment of the review - The user described the laptop cooler as \\"the worst\\" - They had to find a workaround for one issue (lack of fan protection) - The cooler stopped working in 2 months, which displeased the user Step 3: Determine if the review is positive or negative - Since multiple negative experiences were shared, we can conclude that the review is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
