Q: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: I'm not ready to give up on Richard Kelly and his questing intelligence as a filmmaker. Memories of Donnie Darko stay strong, no matter how much Kelly's focus came unglued in 2006's Southland Tales and now, to a lesser extent, in The Box. The premise, drawn from a 1980's Twilight Zone episode itself drawn from Richard Matheson's short story Button, Button, is creepily delicious. The setting is the suburbs of Virginia, near NASA's Langley Research Center. The year is 1976 when NASA's Viking Project became the first U.S. mission to land a spacecraft on the surface of Mars and send photos back to earth. Frank Langella (Oscar nominee for Frost/Nixon) is wonderfully sinister as an elegant stranger with a hole in his cheek who shows up — the box in hand — at the home of NASA engineer Arthur Lewis (James Marsden) and his teacher wife, Norma (Cameron Diaz). His proposition: Push the button on the box and win a million bucks. The catch: Somebody dies, but it's somebody you don't know. Get more news and reviews from Peter Travers on the Travers Take. The couple, in a financial pinch regarding their son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone), agonizes over it. But it's Norma who does the button pushing. Later, another woman will do the same thing while hubby holds back. Does this indicate a misogynist streak in Kelly? The movie gets bogged down in so much exposition that you stop caring. Diaz and Marsden look narcotized throughout. But the images Kelly creates of an alien infiltration of the suburbs harks back to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. This gives the alleged festivities around the wedding of Norma's sister a genuine chilling effect, notably a dance sequence set to the tune of 'When Joanna Loved Me.' What a shame that Kelly's pacing doesn't run as fast as his imagination. Instead of sweeping you along, The Box just sits there like something unclaimed at lost and found. Damaged goods. ||||| Movie Review The Box 'The Box': Don't even bother opening this one Cameron Diaz in 'The Box,' a movie from director Richard Kelly that misses the mark completely. A couple makes a potentially deadly choice. With Cameron Diaz, James Marsden. Director: Richard Kelly (1:55). PG-13: Violence, disturbing images. At area theaters. Some directors, it must be said, only have one really good movie in them. We're starting to worry that Richard Kelly may be among this select group. Kelly impressed legions of college kids with his 2001 debut, \\"Donnie Darko.\\" He followed that edgy cult hit with the disastrous \\"Southland Tales,\\" so his third time out is especially important. And the best to be said is that it's not \\"Southland Tales.\\" But \\"The Box\\" is its own kind of awful, a disconnected mess that never finds its reason for being. Based on Richard Matheson's \\"Button, Button,\\" a (great) short story that was turned into a (pretty good) \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode, Kelly's attempt misses the mark completely. Where the two previous versions were pointedly precise, \\"The Box\\" sprawls sloppily, encompassing unexplained aliens, a screechy score, preposterous special effects, and two stars with no idea what they're doing. As a NASA engineer in 1976, James Marsden's Arthur has been directly involved in a mission to Mars. This may or may not be why a creepy stranger (Frank Langella) delivers the titular gift to his home. Arthur's wife, Norma (Cameron Diaz), is given a choice: She can pass the box on, or push the button inside. If she chooses the latter, she'll earn 1 million, and a stranger will die. Norma takes the bait, but it's the movie that immediately expires. Rather than ending the story with a punch, as Matheson did, Kelly wanders aimlessly, leaving crater-sized gaps in his wake. All we learn for sure is that women always push the button, and their husbands are always loyal and loving enough to forgive them just before they're cruelly punished for their greed. It's no great reflection on Kelly that Marsden - normally so charismatic - sleepwalks through the movie. But Diaz fares worst of all, having chosen (or been instructed) to make vacant idiocy Norma's defining trait. So now you have your own choice to consider: Spend your time and money on Kelly's take, or watch the original \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode at home on YouTube. If only all decisions were this easy. eweitzman@nydailynews.com ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article talks about a movie called \\"The Box.\\" The movie is about a mysterious stranger who gives a couple a box.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy. One obvious choice is to avoid using alcohol or other drugs. Not only will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will also be less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could harm your nervous system. Another way to keep the nervous system healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods. The minerals sodium, calcium, and potassium, and vitamins B 1 and B 12 are important for a healthy nervous system. Some foods that are good sources for these minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney beans (shown in Figure below ). Your brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and fish. Recall that fats insulate the axons of neurons. These fats help build new connections between nerves and brain cells. These fats may improve memory and increase learning and intelligence. Water is also important for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other fluids. This helps prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory problems. And get plenty of rest. Your brain requires plenty of rest so it can strengthen circuits that help with memory.

Keep your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle while rotating into the target.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Maximizing Efficiency and Power in Martial Arts Techniques: The Dynamics of Turning, Pivoting and Rotating Introduction Martial arts, as both a form of physical exercise and self-defense, have been practiced around the world for centuries. From ancient Asian disciplines such as Kung Fu and Karate to more modern boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, one thing that these styles share in common is the efficient use of body mechanics to generate power and reduce the potential for injury. In this article, we will examine a fundamental martial arts technique (turn your dominant hand down while raising your elbow, bend your knee inward while pivoting your body, and keep your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle while rotating into the target) to understand how it optimizes force and stability during combat. Step 1: Turning Your Dominant Hand Down and Raising Your Elbow The dynamics of this movement serve multiple purposes. Firstly, by turning your dominant hand down, you position your fist for a powerful strike- the proper fist alignment keeps the knuckles flat and the wrist straight, reducing the risk of injury. Simultaneously, raising your elbow creates an angle that enables a more effective transfer of energy from your arm to your target. As your elbow ascends, your shoulder and back muscles engage, driving the force of your strike from a broader, more stable base. Step 2: Bending Your Front Knee Inward and Pivoting Your Entire Body In martial arts, much of your striking power comes from your lower body. Bending your front knee inwards and pivoting your entire body allows you to capitalize on the torque generated from your strong lower body muscles. As you pivot on the ball of your foot, your hips rotate, transferring force from the ground up through your legs, hips, and torso. Consequently, your strike becomes more powerful and versatile. In addition to increased striking power, bending your knee ensures that your stance remains stable and grounded, making it difficult for your opponent to off-balance or take you down. Step 3: Maintaining a 90-Degree Angle at Your Elbow and Rotating into the Target The 90-degree angle at your elbow serves as an essential aspect of this technique. By maintaining this angle, your arm becomes a lever capable of generating greater force and follow-through. Furthermore, this position enables your muscles to engage evenly, creating a more stable and controlled strike. Rotating your body into the target ensures that the full momentum of your strike is directed towards the intended point of impact. This results in both increased power and precision – a combination that is critical to an effective martial arts technique. Conclusion The technique described in this article (turn your dominant hand down, raise your elbow, bend your knee inward, pivot your entire body, and maintain a 90-degree angle at the elbow while rotating into the target) exemplifies the interplay of biomechanics in martial arts. Each movement works in harmony to generate power, stability, precision, and efficiency—all traits that are essential for an effective martial artist, regardless of their chosen discipline. By understanding and refining these mechanics, practitioners can maximize their potential and develop a deeper appreciation for the art of combat. Whether you are training for self-defense, competition, or personal growth, integrating these principles will help you become a stronger, more efficient martial artist with a solid foundation for success in your practice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shocking: The SUV smashes through the glass, hitting Mr White. In court: Brenda White said she did not set out to injure her estranged husband. In a 911 recording, obtained by Abc, a distressed-sounding woman can be heard saying: 'This SUV just drove into our building, he's chasing some guy down. 'The car's all the way inside the building. He went through going like 70 miles an hour.' At the time of the incident the pair were in the midst of an 'ugly divorce' police said. Mr White was taken to hospital where. he was treated for broken legs and given 63 stitches over his legs, arms. and face. Mrs White was arrested and charged with attempted murder. She was later released on 500,000 bail. Savage: Mr White is floored by the attack. Injured: Mr White drags himself up off the ground. Mrs White's attorney said she was on a. large amount of anxiety medication and was 'not in her right mind' when. she chased down her former husband. 'On that day, Brenda White's body was behind the wheel of that Ford Explorer,' Jason Schatz said. 'What's in dispute is why this happened.' On trial: Brenda Christine White faces charges of attempted murder and criminal mischief stemming from the 2006 incident. The. incident happened in 2006 but there have been several appeals because. her attorneys have tried to use the defense that she was under. extreme emotional distress. Lawyers argued that she had taken too much Xanax which was partially to blame for the incident. Rare side-effects of taking the drug can include outbursts of anger, delusions and aggressive behavior. Mrs White has since apologised for the attack, which she claims not to remember. Asked what she recalled of the incident she sobbed: 'I don’t. [Being in the parking lot] is the last thing I remember. The next thing I remember, I was inside a building.' She added: 'It was not me. Jon was my husband. He was my best friend, my lover. I would not want to hurt him,' the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Mrs. White claimed to have blacked out after hearing her former husband. speaking on a cell phone and telling another woman he loved her. She. said she had taken a handful of pills on the drive there but had not set. out with the intention of injuring him. 'At some point. in our lives we have all done or said something that we wouldn't have. done if we were in total control of our body,' Mr Schatz added. In his testimony White said he ran from the parking garage when he saw his ex-wife in the SUV. He said he dodged between two parked cars, jumping over a concrete wall, and into the office. At that point, he testified, his ex-wife smashed through the glass and into the building, knocking him to the ground. After being struck he was still able. to get up and continue to run but she drove down a hallway and chased. him, hitting him again. Long process: White's attorneys have pushed for appeals over the past six years, arguing that she was 'not in her right mind' because she had taken too much Xanax before the attack. He said he hid in a closet until a maintenance man found him. Mr White claimed that before the attack, during his lunch break, Mrs White came to his office and played the song Angry Johnny by the singer and songwriter Poe, which includes the lyrics: 'I wanna kill you/I wanna blow you away.' When that lyric came up, she mimicked a gun with her hands and pointed it at his head, he claimed. If convicted Brenda White faces up to five years in jail.

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a major concern to healthcare systems around the world. They are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, in addition to increased hospitalization costs. Recent outbreaks, including those caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus, have highlighted the importance of infection control. Moreover, HAIs, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods, have become a top global priority. Although adequate approaches and guidelines have been in existence for many years and have often proven effective in some countries, the implementation of such approaches in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is often restricted due to limited resources and underdeveloped infrastructure. While evidence-based infection prevention and control (IPC) principles and practices are universal, studies are needed to evaluate simplified approaches that can be better adapted to LMIC needs, in order to guide IPC in practice. A group of experts from around the world attended a workshop held at the 17th International Congress on Infectious Diseases in Hyderabad, India in March 2016, to discuss the existing IPC practices in LMICs, and how best these can be improved within the local context.

Please answer this question: what archipelago nation divided the sea of japan from the pacific ocean?","completion":"The archipelago nation that divides the Sea of Japan from the Pacific Ocean is Japan. Japan is an island nation situated in East Asia, covering a total area of approximately 377,915 square kilometers (145,937 square miles). The archipelago consists of four main islands – Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku – along with numerous smaller islands. These islands stretch along the eastern coast of the Asian continent in a crescent-like shape, almost appearing like a long chain of islands. The Sea of Japan is a marginal sea located between the main Japanese archipelago, the Korean Peninsula, and the eastern coast of Russia. It is bordered by Japan to the east, Russia to the north, North and South Korea to the west, and by the Tsushima and Korea straits to the south. The Sea of Japan is rich in marine life, and many countries in the region, including Japan, South Korea, and Russia, depend on it as an important source of fish and other seafood. On the other side, the vast Pacific Ocean lies to the east of Japan. The island nation has numerous coastal regions that face the Pacific, which plays a significant role in terms of climate, trade connections, and biodiversity. The Pacific Ocean influences Japan's humid and wet climate, with seasonal monsoons that bring considerable rainfall and typhoons that sometimes cause extensive damage to its coasts. Apart from being a natural divider, the strategic location of Japan on the edge of the Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean has played a crucial role in shaping its culture, history, and global influence. Historically, Japan has both benefited and faced challenges due to its unique geographic position. Its accessibility to maritime trade and exchange of ideas has enriched and diversified its culture, but this proximity to other nations has also exposed Japan to invasions and diplomatic tensions. In summary, the archipelago nation of Japan separates the Sea of Japan from the Pacific Ocean. Its unique geography and surrounding marine environment have played a vital role in shaping Japan's culture, history, and global relations throughout the centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The equation is: -16*w = -19*w + 3 2. Our goal is to isolate 'w', so we'll start by adding 19*w to both sides of the equation to remove '-19*w' from the right side. This yields: -16*w + 19*w = -19*w + 19*w + 3 3. Simplify the equation by combining like terms: 3*w = 3 4. Now, we want to isolate 'w' completely, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: (3*w) / 3 = 3 / 3 5. Simplify the equation by dividing: w = 1 Thus, the solution to the equation -16*w = -19*w + 3 is w = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And for the last 24 of them, it turns out she's had a secret weapon -- the nice Ella Slack. The former BBC manager has, unknown to anyone except a handful of key advisers, spent the last quarter of a century acting as the Queen's official stand-in at rehearsals for royal events. The 69-year-old has never accepted a penny for her royal service, considering it \\"a pleasure and an honour\\" to ensure that everything runs smoothly for the Queen. \\"How many people in the world have had a chance to sit in a royal landau or walk onto the dais at Windsor Castle even before the Queen has done so?\\" she said. While Miss Slack may not resemble the Queen facially, she has a similar figure to the Queen, standing just 5 foot. The Queen is 5 foot 2 inch. She began her remarkable role in 1988, when she was working as manager of the BBC's sports and events department. A producer asked her if she could stand in for the Queen to check camera angles at a rehearsal -- and her second career was born. Since then, from the State Opening of Parliament to the 50th anniversary of Victory day, wherever the Queen is on duty Miss Slack is likely to have been there first.

Options: - commercial area - razor - water - city - scissors Explain why a human would choose \\"razor\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"razor\\" as the most important tool the barber uses in a barbershop due to the central role it plays in achieving a wide range of haircuts, styles, and grooming services. Razors are versatile instruments that have been used by barbers for many centuries and continue to serve as an essential piece of equipment in the modern barbershop. Here, we explore the compelling reasons why the razor is considered the most important tool in a barbershop. 1. Versatility: Razors offer unmatched versatility in the wide array of haircuts, styles, and grooming services they can accomplish. They are employed in cutting, trimming, and shaping various hair lengths, while also allowing for precise detailing and edging. This range of functions extends to facial hair grooming, where razors are critical for shaving, outlining, and maintaining facial hair styles. 2. Precision: One of the primary reasons a razor is considered essential is the precision it offers. Razors enable barbers to make very exact cuts, allowing for highly customized and detailed styling. The close cutting a razor provides is essential for achieving clean lines, seamless fades, and well-defined edges. 3. Shaving services: A key component of barbershop services is shaving. While scissors are predominantly used for cutting, razors are reputed for their ability to provide a close, smooth shave. As a cornerstone of men’s grooming, shaving is integral to the barbering experience. With a traditional straight razor or a modern safety razor, barbers are able to provide customers with consistently high-quality shaves, setting them apart from standard hair salons. 4. Skill demonstration: The art of using a razor is an important aspect of professional barbering, requiring extensive training and expertise. Mastering the razor is a prestigious accomplishment, demonstrating to clients the barber’s dedication to honing their skills. As a prominent symbol associated with the barbering profession, the razor highlights a barber's finesse and craftsmanship. 5. Tradition and heritage: The razor has a rich and storied history, dating back thousands of years. Showcasing the cultural legacy of barbering, razors connect the modern profession to its roots. The use of a razor in a barbershop reinforces this bond and demonstrates an appreciation for the timeless tradition of men's grooming. 6. Client satisfaction: By offering a high level of precision, versatility, and control, razors enable barbers to achieve desirable results while catering to individual client preferences. The razor’s role in providing tailored haircuts and grooming services enhances client satisfaction, making it an indispensable tool in the barbershop. In conclusion, a human would choose the \\"razor\\" as the most important tool the barber uses due to the comprehensive range of functions it serves within a barbershop setting. The razor's versatility, precision, and cultural significance establish it as a central element in barbering, allowing professionals to deliver high-quality services that promote client satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: One of the most common chromosome abnormalities is Down syndrome , due to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 resulting in an extra complete chromosome 21, or part of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ). Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy where an affected individual may survive to adulthood. Individuals with Down syndrome often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance. With proper assistance, individuals with Down syndrome can become successful, contributing members of society. The incidence of Down syndrome increases with maternal age. The risk of having a child with Down syndrome is significantly higher among women age 35 and older. I am facing a new situation today: Norm and Ian were two brothers. Norm was a totally normal individual, while Ian had Down syndrome. Their parents loved them both equally.

Questions: A person doesn't have to keep going to school to what? Options: - continue learning - talk to himself - cast shadow - go broke - cross street","completion":"A person doesn't have to keep going to school to continue learning. Education and learning are essential aspects of life. While formal education in schools, colleges, or universities can provide a framework for gaining specific knowledge or qualifications, it is important to recognize that learning can extend beyond the traditional classroom setting. The option \\"continue learning\\" is in line with common sense and is the most relevant answer to the question. Continuing to learn throughout life can take many forms. It can be through personal development by reading books, attending workshops, training sessions, and conferences or learning from others, such as engaging in conversations with experts in a specific field, mentors, and peers. Furthermore, individuals can learn from their personal experiences, successes, and failures. Nowadays, with the help of technology, people have access to a vast amount of information and resources at their fingertips. Online courses, webinars, and educational videos are easily accessible and can cover various subjects at differing levels, providing the opportunity to gain new skills and expand one's understanding of the world. Additionally, informal learning experiences can be gained through participation in hobbies or joining clubs and organizations. This type of learning typically stems from curiosity and the desire to gain knowledge and skills in a particular area. By doing so, individuals can develop various competencies, build relationships, and create an overall personal and professional growth. It is important to embrace lifelong learning as it has numerous benefits. For instance, continual learning can lead to a more fulfilling and enriched life, keeping the mind active and engaged. It encourages personal growth and development, empowers individuals by cultivating critical thinking skills, and paves the way for an increased understanding of oneself and the world. In summary, while formal education is crucial, it is not the only avenue of learning. By identifying opportunities to continue learning outside of traditional institutions, individuals can continue to grow and develop throughout their lives in various ways, contributing to their personal and professional success."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

The answer to the question: To whom is Millar referring when he observes that, positively, any comparisons undertaken would demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm? is inside the article: In his field and day, Wright was certainly eclipsed by his rival the more prolific Lely, to whom he is often compared. One critic, Millar, observes that any comparisons undertaken would \\"ruthlessly expose Wright's weaknesses and mannerisms\\" but that positively \\"they would also demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm, the sources of which must partly lie in his unusual origins, fragmented career and attractive personality\\". Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) (above). Whereas Lely portrayed her as a \\"full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet\\", the more seriously minded Wright, who was not really in sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet-like figure.However, even if Lely was considered the more masterly and fashionable of the two in seventeenth-century Britain, Wright is generally accepted as portraying the more lively and realistic likenesses of his subjects, a fact that reinforces Pepys's observation that Lely's work was \\"good but not like\\". Neither should Wright's realism be confused with a prudishness; as can be seen, for example, in his portrait the lady, thought to be Ann Davis (right). The picture, with the sitter's clothing left undone and her modesty barely preserved by a red drape, has been described as exhibiting a fresh – even risky – reality: erotic by contemporary standards. Whereas Wright's contemporaries might have used the ‘disguise’ of presenting the sitter in the guise of a classical goddess to protect against accusation of salaciousness, Wright's portrait rather depends on his realism, notably in his flesh tones, and depth., can you guess it ?","completion":"Yes, based on the provided information in the article, Millar is referring to the painter John Michael Wright when he observes that any comparisons undertaken would demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity, and charm.

Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous. On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car. While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude. If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else. This kindness spreads.

Since then, U.S. dollar banknotes have only been issued in seven denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. Is it true that was there ever a bill larger than 100?","completion":"Yes, it is true that there were bills larger than 100 in the United States. These large denominations of United States currency were indeed circulated by the United States Treasury until 1969. The primary purpose of these high-denomination bills was to facilitate large transactions between banks and other financial institutions, rather than serving the general public's transactional needs. The decision to discontinue these denominations was driven by several factors, including the increasing use of checks, electronic payment systems, and the belief that it would help combat money laundering and other illicit activities. The large denomination bills that existed included: 1. 500 Bill: William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, was portrayed on the front of the 500 bill. This bill was last issued in 1945 and was officially discontinued in 1969. These bills are now considered collector's items, and as such, their value significantly exceeds their face value. 2. 1,000 Bill: The 1,000 bill featured a portrait of Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President of the United States. Like the 500 bill, the issuance of this denomination ceased in 1945 and was discontinued in 1969. Similar to the 500 bill, the 1,000 bill's value now lies primarily as a collector's item, often fetching a price many times higher than its face value. 3. 5,000 Bill: James Madison, the 4th President and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, appeared on the 5,000 bill. This denomination experienced very limited production, and it was often used for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks. Given their rarity, these bills carry an even higher premium for collectors today. 4. 10,000 Bill: The 10,000 bill featured a portrait of Salmon P. Chase, who served as the 6th Chief Justice of the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury under President Lincoln. Although never widely circulated due to its high value, this bill was used for large transactions between banks. As with the other high-denomination bills, the 10,000 bill is now a rare collector's item that can fetch a significant premium. 5. 100,000 Bill: The 100,000 bill is the largest denomination of U.S. currency ever produced and is considered a gold certificate rather than a standard banknote. It featured a portrait of Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States. However, the 100,000 bill was never circulated among the general public. It was solely used for transactions between the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S. Treasury. Since it was never issued for public circulation, this bill is not considered legal tender, and collectors are not allowed to possess it. In conclusion, there were U.S. currency denominations significantly larger than 100 in the past. However, they were mostly used for transactions between financial institutions and were discontinued in 1969. Today, these high-denomination bills are considered collector's items and can often be found trading for substantially more than their face value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stomach walls.","completion":"In these two sentences, the term \\"wall\\" is used to describe two different concepts that share some similarities but primarily serve different purposes and functions. Let's analyze each of them. 1. \\"We're adding another wall in this room during the remodeling.\\" In this sentence, the \\"wall\\" refers to a structural component of a building or a room, which typically serves as a barrier, provides support, or defines the boundaries of an enclosed space. Walls are essential in the architectural and structural aspects of buildings, as they can separate spaces, provide privacy, and support the overarching structure of a building. Walls in this context are usually made from materials including bricks, stones, concrete blocks, wood, or metal, depending on the requirements of the specific building. They can be interior or exterior walls and can be designed in various styles and thicknesses. 2. \\"Stomach walls.\\" In the context of this sentence, the term \\"wall\\" refers to the muscular layers and lining of the stomach, which is a crucial component of the human body's digestive system. Stomach walls are composed of four layers: the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and serosa. Each of these layers serves a unique function in the process of digestion, from secreting enzymes and acids for breaking down food to pumping the partially digested food towards the intestines for further absorption. Stomach walls also undertake important tasks of mixing and moving food through the digestive tract while protecting the stomach lining from harsh digestive enzymes and gastric acid. In conclusion, although in both sentences the term \\"wall\\" signifies a somewhat enclosing or barrier-like structure, the context and meaning behind the instances are considerably different. The first sentence refers to a physical architectural construct in a building, whereas the second sentence describes a biological component of the human body's digestive system.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Unfortunately not all fashion accessories can be worn at all ages, the snapback being one of them. In some countries, like Europe, boys and men often share the same style, but in countries like the United States, wearing a snapback at an older age can make it seem like you are stuck in the past or don't know how to best dress for your age. You can still be quite stylish at an older age, and you can definitely still wear hats, but wearing a snapback is generally common among teens and young adults, so you might try sticking to styles that complement your age instead of making it look like you are trying to look much younger. If you really want to wear a snapback, you definitely can. Some people want to stand out and don't want to fit in with societal norms, which is totally fine, but just remember that others may not consider it the best style option. Snapbacks are great fashion accessories that can really boost your style, but should only be worn at appropriate times. If you are attending a formal event, or going to a job interview, avoid wearing a hat as this can often be too casual. There are other ways to show your style and uniqueness, so before you throw on your snapback, think about the place you are going and the people that will be there. Before you wear a snapback, make sure you are wearing it for the right reasons. You want to feel comfortable in your snapback and it should complement your personality. If you're going to feel insecure in the snapback you have chosen or feel like a poser then maybe it's best to save the style change for a later time or choose a snapback that better fits you. The point is, snapbacks require confidence, and if you don't feel confident in one then it will likely be noticeable. Wear it because it fits you, not because you are trying to fit into a certain group of people. Summary:","completion":"Snapbacks are a popular hat style mostly worn by young people, but if older people want to wear them, they should choose the right occasions and feel confident about their choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel, associated with the god El, somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE. The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the Kingdom of Israel, and the Kingdom of Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources in the Bible mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian Captivity and Exile, to Babylonian Captivity and Exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation, and the historical relations between Israelites and the homeland, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory.

Lennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \\"Oh, hi.\\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.Two years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

Please answer the following question: BEIJING, Oct. 13 (Xinhuanet) -- A recent sudden temperature drop in most areas of China has set off fears of a possible return of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the country has mobilized to prepare for another outbreak. North China's Tianjin Port resumed a temperature reporting system on Sunday. Any passengers through the port with a temperature above 38 degrees Celsius would be provided medical observation and reported to relevant authorities. Zhong Nanshan, a well-known anti-SARS scientist during the last outbreak, said it was unlikely the SARS virus would die out naturally and it would definitely come back, but predicted no widespread epidemic outbreak and the epidemic would not cause serious damage again. Caught unprepared this spring, Chinese authorities have learned to act quickly before the epidemic can take a hold. Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi Thursday urged strictly implementing the daily SARS epidemic reporting system and warned that people delaying reporting or hiding the true situation would be severely punished. In Beijing, the disease control center in Dongcheng District has recovered a 24 hour schedule for possible epidemic breakout. Every afternoon before 3:00 o'clock, the center receives SARS reports from every hospital in the district and then reports to the Beijing municipal disease control center and health bureau. In Beijing Xiehe Hospital, plans are ready for fever patients to receive treatment in a special section. Doctors in that ward, wearing protective clothing, will observe patients for any possible respiratory diseases. Patients with high fever and symptoms of respiratory diseases are required to be observed for one or two weeks. North China's Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the two other hardest-hit areas in the last SARS crisis, have both set up an emergency response mechanism and mobilized all concerned departments.

At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament. The deciding moment comes when he is watching an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South...

Choose your answer from: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no","completion":"(3). no If we analyze both sentences, we can deduce the following information: Sentence 1: This sentence claims that U.S. officials are asserting that the maximum involvement of their troops in the situation would be to escort Kosovars back to their villages once the hostilities have ended. This means that the troops are not actively engaged in the conflict but provide a supporting role in the aftermath of the conflict, ensuring the safety of the Kosovars while they return to their homes. Sentence 2: This sentence states that the Kosovars are left all alone without any help from these troops. This implies that the troops do not provide any assistance to the Kosovars in any form, not even after the hostilities have ended. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence is not true. The presence of troops, as stated in the first sentence, contradicts the claim in the second sentence that the Kosovars receive no help from these troops.

I'll assume the goal is to create a simple cotton ball craft. Here are the step-by-step process and justification for each step: 1. Gather materials: To start any craft, it's essential to have all the necessary materials on hand. For a cotton ball craft, you'll need cotton balls, glue, a base material like paper or cardboard, and any additional decorative items you'd like to include, such as googly eyes, pipe cleaners, or markers. Justification: Gathering materials beforehand ensures a smooth and uninterrupted crafting session. 2. Choose a design or theme: Decide what you want to create with your cotton balls. Ideas could include animals, shapes, or abstract art. You can look for inspiration online or use your imagination. Justification: Having a clear idea of what you want to create helps guide the crafting process, ensuring a better outcome. 3. Plan your design: Sketch out or visualize your design on the base material. This can be a simple outline or a more detailed plan, depending on your preference. Justification: Planning your design before starting to glue the cotton balls helps to avoid mistakes and achieve a more polished final result. 4. Apply glue: Apply glue to the base material where you plan to place each cotton ball. You can either apply glue directly to the area or put glue on the cotton balls before sticking them onto the base. Justification: Using glue to adhere the cotton balls to the base material ensures that the cotton balls stay in place once the craft is finished. 5. Attach the cotton balls: Press the cotton balls onto the glued areas on the base material, following the plan or outline you've created. You can adjust the amount of fluffiness by pulling apart the cotton balls for a fuller look or compressing them for a flatter appearance. Justification: Attaching the cotton balls according to your design creates the desired visual effect. 6. Add any additional decorations: Use any additional decorative items such as googly eyes, pipe cleaners, or markers to further embellish and personalize your cotton ball craft. Justification: Embellishments enhance the overall appearance of the craft, making it more interesting and unique. 7. Allow the glue to dry: Leave the cotton ball craft aside to dry for the recommended amount of time mentioned on the glue's packaging to ensure that everything stays in place and sets properly. Justification: Allowing the glue to dry fully prevents the cotton balls and embellishments from falling off. 8. Display or share your cotton ball craft: Once the glue is dry, you can display your finished craft in your home or give it as a gift to someone. Justification: Sharing and displaying your completed craft allows you to enjoy the results of your creativity and effort. By following these steps, a person would be able to accomplish their goal of creating a cotton ball craft."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"a peaceful rowboat during dusk.\\", can we conclude \\"The boat is in stormy water at the sun sets.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given statement, \\"a peaceful rowboat during dusk,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that \\"The boat is in stormy water as the sun sets.\\" Let's break down each element of the statements to further understand the reasoning behind this conclusion. 1. \\"A peaceful rowboat during dusk\\": The phrase describes a rowboat that is in a calm and tranquil state during dusk, which is the time just before the sun sets. This suggests that the environment surrounding the boat is likely serene, possibly indicating smooth water, little to no wind, and a general sense of peace. It also emphasizes the time of day, indicating that the boat's peaceful state is specifically occurring during dusk. 2. \\"The boat is in stormy water as the sun sets\\": This statement describes a boat that's within a turbulent, stormy environment while the sun sets. The phrase \\"stormy water\\" suggests rough conditions such as high waves, strong winds, or even rainfall which is contrary to the \\"peaceful rowboat\\" description provided earlier. Additionally, it identifies that these conditions take place as the sun sets, which may coincide with dusk, but it focuses more on the stormy environment rather than the tranquility suggested in the first statement. When comparing these two statements, they present contrasting environments - a peaceful rowboat versus a boat in stormy water. The first statement suggests a calm, serene setting during dusk, while the second statement implies turbulent, stormy conditions as the sun sets. These conflicting descriptions lead us to the conclusion that we cannot definitively say that \\"The boat is in stormy water as the sun sets\\" based on the information provided in the phrase \\"a peaceful rowboat during dusk.\\" It is essential to recognize that the absence of information about the weather conditions or the presence of storms in the first statement doesn't automatically confirm that these conditions don't exist. However, given that \\"peaceful\\" and \\"stormy\\" are contrasting adjectives describing the rowboat's environment, it becomes less likely that the second statement is a valid conclusion based solely on the first statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: This paper is dedicated to Professor Joep Lange, a Dutch pioneer in AIDS research and a great protagonist of access to effective antiretroviral therapy for all. On July 17 this year, Joep died in the plane crash in Ukraine on his way to the AIDS conference in Australia. a b s t r a c t At any given moment, our body is under attack by a large variety of pathogens, which aim to enter and use our body to propagate and disseminate. The extensive cellular and molecular complexity of our immune system enables us to efficiently eliminate invading pathogens or at least develop a condition in which propagation of the microorganism is reduced to a minimum. Yet, the evolutionary pressure on pathogens to circumvent our immune defense mechanisms is immense, which continuously leads to the development of novel pathogenic strains that challenge the health of mankind. Understanding this battle between pathogen and the immune system has been a fruitful area of immunological research over the last century and will continue to do so for many years. In this review, which has been written on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Dutch Society for Immunology, we provide an overview of the major contributions that Dutch immunologists and infection biologists have made in the last decades on the inflammatory response to viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections. We focus on those studies that have addressed both the host and the pathogen, as these are most interesting from an immunological point of view. Although it is not possible to completely cover this comprehensive research field, this review does provide an interesting overview of Dutch research on inflammatory responses to infection. Title: Inflammatory responses to infection: The Dutch contribution","completion":"Step-by-Step Analysis and Justification: 1. The paragraph talks about the paper dedicated to Professor Joep Lange, an AIDS researcher - Title does not mention anything about Professor Joep Lange, but this is not essential for the title. 2. The paragraph discusses the battle between pathogens and the immune system and the extensive complexity of our immune system - The title refers to \\"Inflammatory responses to infection,\\" which is related to the immune system and its response to pathogens. 3. The paragraph focuses on the research work of Dutch immunologists and infection biologists - The title refers to \\"The Dutch contribution,\\" which indicates the paper's focus on Dutch researchers' work. 4. The paragraph reviews the major contributions in the last decades on the inflammatory response to various types of infections - The title explicitly mentions \\"inflammatory responses to infection\\", which agrees with the content of the paragraph. 5. The paragraph focuses on studies related to both host and pathogen - Although the title does not explicitly mention both host and pathogen, it can be inferred from the term \\"inflammatory responses to infection\\" as the response involves both.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Idaho for the following movie plot: Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard Ann (Carole Lombard) and David Smith (Robert Montgomery) are a married couple living in New York who, though happy, often have fights that last for days before they lovingly reconcile. One morning, Ann asks David if he had to do it over again, would he marry her? To her disappointment, although he is very happy with her now and wouldn't marry someone else, he answers that he would not. Later that day, Harry Deever (Charles Halton), an Idaho county official, informs David that due to a jurisdictional mishap, their three-year-old marriage license from Idaho is not valid. Since Deever is a family acquaintance of Ann's from Idaho, he stops by their apartment to tell Ann and her mother (Esther Dale) the same thing. Ann does not mention this to David and thinks he will remarry her that very night, as he just invited her out to a romantic dinner at the fancy restaurant they ate at before they were married. When they arrive at the restaurant, however, they realize that the restaurant has turned into a seedy joint, and they head home. When Ann feels she has given David long enough to propose and leave to get married, she confronts him and accuses him of not wanting to marry her again. While David protests and says he was going to ask her shortly, Ann dismisses that and kicks him out of their apartment. David spends the night at his club, but when he goes home after work the next day, he is not allowed entry by her maid. David waits in the lobby and sees Ann return with an older gentleman suitor. An angry and disheartened David takes to following Ann around, telling her he will not support her, then getting her fired from a new job she has just taken (as it turns out, the older gentleman suitor is her boss). Ann tells David she has no intention of ever marrying him. David's friend and law partner, Jefferson \\"Jeff\\" Custer (Gene Raymond), tells David he will talk to Ann and persuade her to remarry.

When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food. These mountains are ours.\\" \\"Your food?\\" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. \\"That's ridiculous. It's food.

Questions: Where are you likely to find the freshest tomatoes? Options: - pizza - squashed - refrigerator - market - on pizza Answer:","completion":"You are likely to find the freshest tomatoes at the market. Here's a detailed explanation of why the market is the best option in line with common sense: 1. Market: Fresh produce, including tomatoes, is typically brought to markets by local farmers and distributors. Markets specifically aim to offer a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables for purchase. As a supply and demand location, vendors at markets ensure that the items they display for sale are at their peak freshness. This way, buyers can expect to find and select from an array of fresh tomatoes that were likely picked and transported within a short time frame. The market is undoubtedly the most logical choice when looking for fresh tomatoes, as other options include either processed or stored versions. 2. Pizza: When it comes to pizza toppings, tomatoes may either be used as a base sauce or as an additional topping. In any case, the tomatoes utilized in this context have gone through significant processing (cooked or at the very least, sliced) and lose their freshness factor, making pizza an inadequate option for finding fresh tomatoes. 3. Squashed: Squashed tomatoes have been damaged and are not suitable for consumption. They may not necessarily be rotten, but their freshness is significantly compromised due to bruising and bacterial exposure. Anyone seeking fresh tomatoes would not consider squashed tomatoes as a viable option. 4. Refrigerator: Although refrigeration preserves the longevity of tomatoes by slowing down the ripening process, it may also alter their taste and texture. The longer a tomato is stored in a refrigerator, the less fresh it becomes. Consequently, considering tomatoes stored in a refrigerator as the freshest choice is far from the most accurate option. 5. On pizza: Similar to the case of finding fresh tomatoes in pizza, tomatoes used as toppings on pizza have already been sliced, processed, and cooked. The high temperatures involved in making pizza rob tomatoes of their freshness. As a result, finding the freshest tomatoes on pizza is not a plausible alternative. In conclusion, based on the given options and taking common sense into account, the market is the most suitable location to find the freshest tomatoes. With vendors providing a variety of ripe and fresh tomatoes, the market outshines the other alternatives where tomatoes have been cooked, altered, or stored for an extended period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His story begins in the Tuscany workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio (a name his cat Figaro and fish Cleo both dislike). Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio would be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience. Gideon and Honest John Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who convince him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings while performing with marionettes of Dutch girls, French can-can girls, and Russian Cossacks. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him up in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy then appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. At the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts. It all looks very promising from the get go. With some supernatural elements thrown in, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. The main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on. Normally a person in his situation would have several options. Somehow he does not have those options. In this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault. Out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church,prayer and God. And they provide the answer for his problem. It should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message.

With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Elizabeth Cochran Seaman (May 5, 1864 January 27, 1922), known by her pen name Nellie Bly, was an American journalist. She was also a writer, industrialist, inventor, and a charity worker who was widely known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days, in emulation of Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg, and an exposé in which she faked insanity to study a mental institution from within. She was a pioneer in her field, and launched a new kind of investigative journalism. - The New York World was a newspaper published in New York City from 1860 until 1931. The paper played a major role in the history of American newspapers. It was a leading national voice of the Democratic Party. From 1883 to 1911 under publisher Joseph Pulitzer, it became a pioneer in yellow journalism, capturing readers' attention and pushing its daily circulation to the one-million mark. - Yellow journalism, or the yellow press, is a type of journalism that presents little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines to sell more newspapers. Techniques may include exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering or sensationalism. By extension, the term \\"yellow journalism\\" is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion. - Jules Gabriel Verne ( 8 February 1828 24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction. - Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated. In the United States, the corporate headquarters represents the entity at the center or the top of a corporation taking full responsibility for managing all business activities. In the UK, the term head office is most commonly used for the HQs of large corporations. The term is also used regarding military organizations. - Phileas Fogg is the protagonist in the 1873 Jules Verne novel \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\". - The history of American newspapers begins in the early 18th century with the publication of the first colonial newspapers. American newspapers began as modest affairsa sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for American independence. Following independence the first article of U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press and the American press grew rapidly during the First Party System (1790s-1810s) when both parties sponsored papers to reach their loyal partisans. From the 1830s onward the Penny press began to play a major role in American journalism and technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s helped expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted. By 1900 major newspapers had become profitable powerhouses of advocacy, muckraking and sensationalism, along with serious, and objective news-gathering. During the early 20th Century, prior to rise of television, the average American read several newspapers per-day. Starting in the 1920s changes in technology again morphed the nature of American journalism as radio and later, television, began to play increasingly important competitive roles. - Joseph Pulitzer (born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847 October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the \\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\\" and the \\"New York World\\". Pulitzer introduced the techniques of yellow journalism to the newspapers he acquired in the 1880s. He became a leading national figure in the Democratic Party and was elected congressman from New York. He crusaded against big business and corruption, and helped keep the Statue of Liberty in New York. - In the study of human settlements, an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central place (\\"usually a municipality\\") and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself. - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. - Ten Days in a Mad - House is a book by newspaper reporter Nellie Bly .

The meanings of thousands of everyday perceptions(, ), the bases for the decisions we make, and the roots of our habits and skills are to be found in our past experiences, which are brought into the present by memory. Memory can be defined as the capacity to keep information available for later use. It includes not only \\"remembering\\" things like arithmetic or historical facts, but also involves any change in the way an animal typically behaves. Memory is involved when a rat gives up eating grain because he has sniffed something suspicious in the grain pile. Memory is also involved when a six-year-old child learns to swing a baseball bat. Memory exists not only in humans and animals but also in some physical objects and machines. Computers, for example, contain devices from storing data for later use. It is interesting to compare the memory-storage capacity of a computer with that of a human being. The instant-access memory of a large computer may hold up to 100,000 \\"words\\"--ready for instant use. An average prefix = st1 /U.

The bars had been restored since he had wrenched them off to give ingress to the family on the day of recapture. He glanced around the room; nothing seemed to have been disturbed. Nevertheless he was uneasy. The suspicions of a frank, trustful nature when once aroused are apt to be more general and far-reaching than the specific distrusts of the disingenuous, for they imply the overthrow of a whole principle and not a mere detail. Clarence's conviction that Susy had seen Pedro recently since his dismissal led him into the wildest surmises of her motives. It was possible that without her having reason to suspect Pedro's greater crime, he might have confided to her his intention of reclaiming the property and installing her as the mistress and chatelaine of the rancho. The idea was one that might have appealed to Susy's theatrical imagination. He recalled Mrs. McClosky's sneer at his own pretensions and her vague threats of a rival of more lineal descent. The possible infidelity of Susy to himself touched him lightly when the first surprise was over; indeed, it scarcely could be called infidelity, if she knew and believed Mary Rogers's discovery; and the conviction that he and she had really never loved each other now enabled him, as he believed, to look at her conduct dispassionately.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Which type of muscle fiber can sustain long contractions? A: Choices: (a). fast fibres (b). intense fibers (c). direct fibers (d). slow fibers A:","completion":"The type of muscle fiber that can sustain long contractions is (d). slow fibers. Slow fibers, also known as slow-twitch muscle fibers or Type I muscle fibers, are designed to provide consistent, long-lasting contractions. These fibers have a slower contraction speed compared to fast fibers (or fast-twitch muscle fibers, also known as Type II fibers). Slow fibers contain more mitochondria, which are the energy-producing components of cells, and higher amounts of myoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen. This allows them to generate energy more efficiently through aerobic metabolism. Due to their greater fatigue resistance and ability to generate energy for extended periods, slow fibers are crucial for endurance activities, such as long-distance running, cycling, and swimming. In contrast, fast fibers (Type II) are better suited for high-intensity, short-duration activities, such as sprinting or heavy weightlifting. The other choices provided, intense fibers and direct fibers, are not standard terms for describing muscle fiber types. In summary, slow fibers (d) are the muscle fiber type capable of sustaining long contractions owing to their increased capacity for energy generation through greater mitochondrial content and myoglobin presence. They are essential for endurance-based activities and sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Background: Dinesh Joseph D'Souza (; born April 25, 1961) is an Indian American right-wing political commentator, author, and filmmaker. From 2010 to 2012, he was president of The King's College, a Christian school in New York City. Born in Bombay, D'Souza came to the United States as an exchange student and graduated from Dartmouth College. He became a naturalized citizen in 1991. Context: On July 25, 2016, D'Souza released the documentary film Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party. The film criticizes the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive (and ultimate) Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 2016. The film was universally panned by professional film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4%, based on 27 professional reviews, with an average rating of 1.7/10. The critics consensus on the site reads, \\"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party finds Dinesh D'Souza once again preaching to the right-wing choir--albeit less effectively than ever.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 2 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\".

Information: - Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the 14th largest city in the European Union. It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters. - A libertine is one devoid of most moral or sexual restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society. Libertinism is described as an extreme form of hedonism. Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in France and Great Britain. Notable among these were John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the Marquis de Sade. - Don Giovanni (K. 527; complete title: , literally \\"The Rake Punished, namely Don Giovanni\\" or \\"The Libertine Punished\\") is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer. It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787. Da Ponte's libretto was billed as a \\"dramma giocoso\\", a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an \\"opera buffa\\". Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements. - Mariano Padilla y Ramos ( 1842 -- 21 November 1906 ) was a Spanish operatic baritone who excelled in the title role of Mozart 's Don Giovanni . - Don Juan (Spanish), Don Giovanni (Italian) is a legendary, fictional libertine. The first written version of the \\"Don Juan\\" legend was written by the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina (\\"nom de plume\\" of Gabriel Téllez). His play, \\"El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra\\" (\\"The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest\\"), was set in the fourteenth century and published in Spain around 1630. The name \\"Don Juan\\" is a common metaphor for a \\"womanizer\\". - Dramma giocoso (Italian, literally: drama with jokes; plural: \\"drammi giocosi\\") is a genre of opera common in the mid-18th century. The term is a contraction of \\"dramma giocoso per musica\\" and describes the opera's libretto (text). The genre developed in the Neapolitan opera tradition, mainly through the work of the playwright Carlo Goldoni in Venice. A \\"dramma giocoso\\" characteristically used a grand \\"buffo\\" (comic or farce) scene as a dramatic climax at the end of an act. Goldoni's texts always consisted of two long acts with extended finales, followed by a short third act. Composers Baldassare Galuppi, Niccolò Piccinni, and Joseph Haydn set Goldoni's texts to music. - Lorenzo Da Ponte (10 March 174917 August 1838) was an Italian, later American opera librettist, poet and Roman Catholic priest. He wrote the libretti for 28 operas by 11 composers, including three of Mozart's greatest operas, \\"Don Giovanni\\", \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" and \\"Così fan tutte\\". - The Estates Theatre or Stavovské divadlo is a historic theatre in Prague, Czech Republic.

If yes, write \\"True\\", otherwise write \\"False\\". Question: what powers are specific to a particular house of Congress? Suggestion: Both representatives and senators are chosen through direct election . The answer to this question is:","completion":"False. The question is asking about specific powers that are unique to a particular house of Congress, either the House of Representatives or the Senate. The proposed suggestion is not relevant to the question because it focuses on the election process and does not address any specific powers belonging to either house of Congress. To provide a more complete and relevant answer: The United States Congress is divided into two main houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Both houses share many powers, such as the power to pass legislation and declare war. However, each house also has unique powers that are specific to that particular house. For the House of Representatives, the specific powers include: 1. Initiating revenue bills: All bills that deal with raising revenue, such as taxes, must originate in the House of Representatives. This power aligns with the idea that the House is meant to be more responsive to the people, as it has a more direct connection to the population through proportional representation. 2. Impeachment authority: The House of Representatives has the power to impeach a federal official, including the President. This means that they can charge the accused with misconduct and potentially lead to a trial, which is then held by the Senate. For the Senate, the specific powers include: 1. Ratifying treaties: Any treaties made by the President must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate before they go into effect. This acts as a check on the President's foreign policy authority and ensures that the Senate has a role in shaping the nation's international agreements. 2. Confirmations: The Senate has the power to confirm appointments made by the President, such as those of federal judges, cabinet officials, and ambassadors. This process often involves hearings and deliberation before the Senate votes to either confirm or reject the appointment. 3. Trying impeached officials: If the House of Representatives initiates impeachment proceedings against a federal official, the Senate is responsible for holding the trial and deciding whether the individual should be removed from office. A two-thirds majority vote is required for removal. In conclusion, the suggested answer \\"Both representatives and senators are chosen through direct election\\" is false because it does not address the specific powers that belong to particular houses of Congress.

I know that the answer to the question \\"A non-serious violation of Bible principles can be penalized by what?\\" is in \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"A non-serious violation of Bible principles in the context of Jehovah's Witnesses can be penalized by \\"marking.\\" Marking is a form of discipline that involves curtailing social, but not spiritual, fellowship with a baptized member who persists in a course of action that is considered a violation of Bible principles, but not a serious sin. This practice aims to encourage the individual to rectify their behavior and align themselves with the teachings and principles upheld by the congregation. Unlike disfellowshipping or formal reproof, marking does not involve complete shunning or restriction of spiritual fellowship. Instead, it serves as a reminder for the individual to adhere to the standards set by the Jehovah's Witnesses community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer a question about the following article about Child labour: While full-time work hinders schooling, empirical evidence is varied on the relationship between part-time work and school. Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance. On the other hand, many poor children work for resources to attend school. Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work. Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home. In the modern world, school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children, often replacing participation in productive work. If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork, school may impede the learning of skills, such as agriculture, which will become necessary for future livelihood. What hinders schooling for child labourers?","completion":"Several factors hinder schooling for child labourers, as discussed in the article. These factors can be categorized as economic, social, academic, and personal: 1. Economic factors: Many poor children need to work to obtain resources for attending school. Due to financial constraints in their families, they are compelled to engage in part-time or full-time work to cover their educational expenses, such as tuition fees, books, and uniforms. 2. Social factors: The societal pressure to contribute to the family income often leads to children becoming involved in part-time or full-time work. This may result in insufficient time and energy to focus on their schooling, which ultimately affects their regular attendance and academic performance. 3. Academic factors: The article highlights that some children may find school education inadequate in preparing them for the available job opportunities. If the school curriculum does not teach the skills needed for local employment, such as agriculture, children may resort to work to learn practical skills and gain experience for their future livelihood. 4. Personal factors: Children who are not performing well in school may seek a more satisfactory experience in work. A positive relationship with a supervisor at work can provide relief from the stress and tensions experienced at school and home. Consequently, this encourages them to continue working rather than focusing on their studies. To summarize, child labourers face various hurdles in their pursuit of education. Economic factors compel them to work due to financial constraints, social factors place pressure on children to contribute to family income, academic factors create disillusionment when schools don't provide relevant skills, and personal factors lead some children to prioritize work over schooling for emotional and personal satisfaction. Each of these factors contributes to the hindrance of their access to education, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and limiting their opportunities for a better future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul Louis Broum The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Shadow of Deceit Genre: Crime-Mystery-Thriller Plot Summary: Johny Vulkan, a prominent business magnate, is found murdered in his luxurious mansion in the suburbs of an opulent city. The question on everyone's mind is: who would want to kill this influential figure? As the investigation unfolds, Sergeant Anne Cardell, a seasoned detective, discovers a twisted plot of lies, secrecy, and deception that will bring her face to face with some powerful, unexpected suspects, including Paul Louis Broum, the rising star of the art world. Act 1: The story begins with the discovery of Johny Vulkan's lifeless body in his mansion, the crime scene meticulously arranged to look like a suicide. Anne Cardell is assigned to lead the investigation, feeling the pressure from her superiors, as Johny was a widely respected and influential man. While examining the scene, Anne notices some discrepancies: a muffled gunshot noise caught on a recording, overheard during a phone call—to Paul Louis Broum. This leads her to believe that Johny's death was not a suicide, but a well-planned murder. Anne's investigation takes her deep into the luxurious world of high society and the intertwined lives of the elite. As she delves, she discovers that Johny was more than just a wealthy entrepreneur; he was also involved in several shady deals, including illegal art trafficking and money laundering. This revelation raises the stakes and puts a large target on Anne's back as she faces threats from those who want to keep the truth hidden. Act 2: Anne continues to search for clues and starts questioning the people close to Johny. Among them is Paul Louis Broum, a talented young artist with a seemingly bright future. Anne uncovers that before his death, Johny had been financing Paul's career and gallery exhibitions from the start, leading her to suspect Paul's potential involvement in Johny's murder. After some digging, Anne finds out that Johny and Paul had a bitter falling out when Johny had attempted to exploit and manipulate Paul's artworks for his illegal art trafficking scheme. This sparks Anne's interest in Paul's possible motive for murder. As Anne investigates Paul further, she uncovers several layers of deceit and a hidden love affair between Paul and Johny's estranged wife, Theresa. She also comes across incriminating evidence that connects Paul to the suspicious purchase of heavy-duty cleaning tools and unregistered firearms, only days before Johny's murder. Act 3: Pressure from the city's elite intensifies as they demand a swift conclusion to the case. Despite the suspicious circumstances, Anne struggles to establish concrete evidence that Paul committed the murder. As a result, she is pulled from the case and replaced by a new investigator who is swayed by the power and influence of Johny's close associates, effectively abandoning the search for truth. Undeterred, Anne continues privately to pursue Paul and decode the complicated web of lies and deceit. Eventually, she discovers that Paul was framed by one of Johny's corrupt partners, a high-profile city council member who had orchestrated the entire murder to protect his illicit operations. In a climactic showdown, Anne confronts the council member and his gang of armed accomplices. Using her wit and years of experience, she is able to outsmart them and gather enough evidence to expose their crimes to the public. Anne redeems herself professionally and personally while delivering justice for Johny Vulkan. Epilogue: Paul is seen walking out of a courtroom, cleared of all charges. Theresa thanks Anne for her unwavering pursuit of the truth. Their future is uncertain, but the intense shared experience has sparked a new friendship that will endure. Anne continues her career as a detective, embracing the newfound recognition of her talents, knowing that her pursuit of truth can bring justice and resolution for those within the city she serves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:John was studying the history of dinosaurs. He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history. Would era A see less or more biodiversity than era B? Hint: Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since: A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, era A represents the time when dinosaurs were flourishing before the mass extinction event, which occurred around 66 million years ago. During this time, there would be a variety of species coexisting, competing for environmental niches, and evolving through genetic mutation. Era B, on the other hand, represents the time period of the mass extinction event itself. During a mass extinction, the extinction rate is much higher than usual, and a large number of species are lost. This often results from an accumulation of smaller extinction events that take place in a relatively brief period of time. Considering the hint about the constant extinction of species and the occurrence of mass extinction events, era A would likely show more biodiversity compared to era B. This is because era A represents a time when many species were thriving, whereas era B represents a time when a large number of species experienced extinction. The mass extinction event during era B would have greatly reduced the biodiversity present at that time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options： A. air B. rock C. arctic D. log E. field A:","completion":"E. Field Insects can be found in various environments, but when it comes to finding them eating something green, a field is the most suitable option among the choices provided. Fields, especially those dominated by plants and grasses, provide an ideal habitat for insects. The green plants and grasses in fields are often rich in nutrients that many insects rely on for sustenance. A diverse array of insects, such as caterpillars, grasshoppers, aphids, and beetles, can be found in fields, munching on leaves, stems, and other green parts of plants. In addition to being a food source, fields offer insects numerous other benefits, such as shelter and hiding spots from predators. The dense vegetation in a field can provide insects with suitable micro-habitats that help them thrive. Comparing the other options: A. Air - While some insects spend part of their lives flying through the air, they generally do not consume food while in the air. An exception would be some adult insects such as moths or butterflies that feed on nectar from flowers while flying. However, the green parts of plants are not typically eaten in the air. B. Rock - Rocks, by nature, are inorganic and do not provide a source of green plants or food for insects. Although certain organisms, like mosses and lichens, can grow on rocks, they are not the preferred food source for most insects. C. Arctic - The extreme cold and harsh conditions of the Arctic limit the prevalence of insects in this environment. Additionally, the vegetation in the Arctic tends to be less diverse and less abundant than in other biomes, leading to fewer opportunities for insects to be found eating green plants. D. Log - While logs can provide habitats for various insects, they are unlikely to find green plants to consume on a log. Many insects that live in and around logs feed on decomposing wood, fungi, or other insects but not green plants. Given these comparisons, the field is the most suitable option for finding insects eating something green. This environment offers a diverse range of green plant life for insects to consume and provides appropriate living conditions for a broader range of insect species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Imagine towers of boxes, all of them filled with broken glass and old electronic devices. Technology graveyards like this can be found in communities across the country. Experts say that landfills and warehouses will overflow unless a plan for the disposal and reuse of electronics is put into place. \\"We can't put electronics and glass aside and tell ourselves we'll deal with them later,\\" Lauren Roman, managing director of Transparent Planet said. Roman's group works to improve the disposal of electronic waste. She says about 660 million pounds of tech trash is produced each year in the US. What's behind the tech trash pile-up? About ten years ago, major advances were made in computer and television technology. Manufacturers began producing devices like flat-paneled LCDs and plasma screen monitors. These new products provide a clearer image and take up less space than older models. It goes without saying that consumers choose them rather than heavy, glass-based technologies. The new electronics are built with materials that are difficult to recycle. In addition, the new products have decreased the demand for recycled parts from the older monitors and screens. Older, heavier computer monitors and TVs used glass-based components called CRTs. CRTs have a high lead content and can be environmentally risky if not recycled properly. If crushed and put in landfills, the lead from CRTs could seep into groundwater and rivers, harming the water supply. For many years, plants and recycling programs safely processed CRTs. The recycled CRTs were reused in the construction of new monitors. Monitors being made today do not use glass tubes. \\"People are returning old-style TVs with CRTs, but no new ones are being made,\\" said Linnel. This is creating an imbalance in the amount of glass being disposed of and recycled properly. Many recycling companies have shut down. Others no longer have the resources or space to process...

In January 2007, the group publicly announced their reformation and on 23 February, after 20 days of auditions, former Beck drummer Matt Sherrod joined Finn, Seymour and Mark Hart to complete the new line up. As Sherrod and Hart had not participated in the initial sessions, four new tracks were recorded with producer Steve Lillywhite including the album's first single \\"Don't Stop Now\\".

In an April 1964 letter to his agent, Candida Donadio, Pynchon wrote that he was facing a creative crisis, with four novels in progress, announcing: \\"If they come out on paper anything like they are inside my head then it will be the literary event of the millennium.\\" In the mid-1960s, Pynchon lived at 217 33rd St. in Manhattan Beach, California, in a small downstairs apartment. In December 1965, Pynchon politely turned down an invitation from Stanley Edgar Hyman to teach literature at Bennington College, writing that he had resolved, two or three years earlier, to write three novels at once. Pynchon described the decision as \\"a moment of temporary insanity\\", but noted that he was \\"too stubborn to let any of them go, let alone all of them.\\" Pynchon's second novel, The Crying of Lot 49, was published a few months later in 1966. Whether it was one of the three or four novels Pynchon had in progress is not known, but in a 1965 letter to Donadio, Pynchon had written that he was in the middle of writing a \\"potboiler\\". When the book grew to 155 pages, he called it, \\"a short story, but with gland trouble\\", and hoped that Donadio could \\"unload it on some poor sucker.\\" The Crying of Lot 49 won the Richard and Hilda Rosenthal Foundation Award shortly after publication. Although more concise and linear in its structure than Pynchon's other novels, its labyrinthine plot features an ancient, underground mail service known as \\"The Tristero\\" or \\"Trystero\\", a parody of a Jacobean revenge drama called The Courier's Tragedy, and a corporate conspiracy involving the bones of World War II American GIs being used as charcoal cigarette filters. It proposes a series of seemingly incredible interconnections between these events and other similarly bizarre revelations that confront the novel's protagonist, Oedipa Maas. Like V., the novel contains a wealth of references to science and technology and to obscure historical events, with both books dwelling on the detritus of American society and culture. The Crying of Lot 49 also continues Pynchon's strategy of composing parodic song lyrics and punning names, and referencing aspects of popular culture within his prose narratives. In particular, it incorporates a very direct allusion to the protagonist of Nabokov's Lolita within the lyric of a love lament sung by a member of \\"The Paranoids\\", an American teenage band who deliberately sing their songs with British accents (p. 17). Answer this question \\"What is The Crying of Lot 49?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"The Crying of Lot 49 is Thomas Pynchon's second novel, published in 1966.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the house from which a chancel, separated from the nave by an oak screen, projects eastward from the main plan? is inside the article: The wolf head crest also appears in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is decorated with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.William Moreton III used what is today known as the Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the adjoining Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.The Corn Store adjacent to the Chapel may originally have been used as accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp. Five oak-framed bins inside may have held barley for the Brew-house, which is now used as a toilet block., can you guess it ? The answer is:","completion":"The answer to the question is \\"Little Moreton Hall\\". This can be inferred from the sentence \\"The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.\\" My deduction process follows these steps: 1. Identify the main query: The user wants to know the full name of the house with a specific architectural detail – that its chancel, which is separated from the nave by an oak screen, projects eastward from the main plan. 2. Scan the text for relevant information: In the provided text or 'article', the house with the specified architectural characteristics matches \\"Little Moreton Hall\\", as described in the sentence “The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house…” 3. Verify the information: Cross-referencing the identified information with the question, it is confirmed that Little Moreton Hall is indeed the house that fits the description provided. 4.

Orrin Hatch accused Sebelius of being \\"untruthful\\" when she said implementation of the law was on track. In an exchange being touted by conservative sites Fox News and the Daily Caller, John Cornyn pointed out that the government didn't require criminal background checks for \\"navigators,\\" the support staff who help people register. \\"So a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual?\\" Cornyn asked. \\"This is possible,\\" Sebelius replied.","completion":"Title: Secretary Sebelius Faces Senate Finance Committee on ObamaCare Implementation Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, faced another round of questioning about the Obama administration's healthcare reform efforts. This time, she appeared before the Senate Finance Committee where she faced bipartisan calls to delay parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation. However, she rejected these demands as insufficient given the pressing need for healthcare access. During her testimony, Sebelius underscored that delaying the ACA's provisions would not delay the pressing health issues that many Americans face. \\"Delaying the Affordable Care Act would not delay people's cancer or diabetes or Parkinson's disease,\\" she said, according to the New York Times. Sebelius continued by stating that \\"for millions of Americans, delay is not an option.\\" Although recognizing that the initial enrollment figures would likely be low, Sebelius stood firm in her opposition to any delays. Members of the committee from both parties took turns expressing their frustrations and complaints about the problematic rollout of the ACA, which has been plagued by website glitches and issues affecting individual policies. Notably, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch accused Sebelius of being \\"untruthful\\" in previous claims that the implementation of healthcare law was on schedule. The hearing took a contentious turn when Republican Senator John Cornyn raised concerns about the lack of criminal background checks for \\"navigators,\\" the support staff who assist people in registering for the healthcare exchanges. Cornyn questioned whether \\"a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual.\\" Sebelius responded by acknowledging that such a scenario, under the current guidelines, was indeed possible, sparking increased concern among conservative commentators. This appearance marked another difficult day for Sebelius, who has become the face of the ACA's troubled implementation. The hearings on Capitol Hill also highlight the ongoing debate about the state of healthcare reform and the need for any modifications or delays to the ACA. While the Obama administration acknowledges some issues with the rollout, they remain adamant that accelerating the delay in implementing crucial healthcare protections would be detrimental to the millions of Americans currently without access to adequate care. The hearings underscore the growing tensions between lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with Democrats increasingly voicing their concerns and frustrations with the Obama administration's handling of the healthcare reform efforts. For the moment, both sides have little choice but to wait and watch how the implementation of the ACA unfolds, the public sentiment surrounding it, and potential legislative and administrative changes that may be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: O'Keeffe was born on November 15, 1887, in a farmhouse located at 2405 Hwy T in the town of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. O'Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model, as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, \\"The most remarkable thing about O'Keefe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work.\\" At that time, even in Europe, there were few arts exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style. She received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style in all aspects of her life. O'Keeffe was also known for her relationship with Stieglitz, in which she provided some insight in her autobiography. A substantial part of her estate's assets were transferred to the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, a nonprofit. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum opened in Santa Fe in 1997. The assets included a large body of her work, photographs, archival materials, and her Abiquiu house, library, and property. The Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiu was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and is now owned by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum. In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32 cent stamp honoring O'Keeffe. In 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, the USPS issued a stamp featuring O'Keeffe's Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico/Out Back of Marie's II, 1930 as part of their Modern Art in America series. A fossilized species of archosaur was named Effigia okeeffeae (\\"O'Keeffe's Ghost\\") in January 2006, \\"in honor of Georgia O'Keeffe for her numerous paintings of the badlands at Ghost Ranch and her interest in the Coelophysis Quarry when it was discovered\\".

ANKARA, Turkey -- Popular artist Bedri Baykam and his assistant were attacked and stabbed in Istanbul on Monday (April 18th) after participating in a meeting to protest the destruction of a controversial monument in the eastern city of Kars.

Here's an explanation on how I translated it; 1) I started from the beginning of the sentence \\"ANKARA, Turkey --> ANKARA, Türkiye\\" because Turkey is Türkiye in Turkish. 2) Then I proceeded to translate \\"popular artist Bedri Baykam and his assistant\\" to \\"Ünlü sanatçı Bedri Baykam ve asistanı\\". In this case, 'popular' becomes 'ünlü', 'artist' becomes 'sanatçı', and 'his assistant' becomes 've asistanı'. 3) The next part \\"were attacked and stabbed in Istanbul on Monday\\" is translated to \\"Pazartesi günü İstanbul'da saldırıya uğrayıp bıçaklandılar\\". Here, 'were attacked' turns into 'saldırıya uğrayıp', and 'stabbed' is 'bıçaklandı'. 4) Finally, I translated \\"after participating in a meeting to protest the destruction of a controversial monument in the eastern city of Kars\\" to \\"doğu şehri Kars'taki tartışmalı bir anıtın yıkımını protesto etmek amacıyla katıldıkları bir toplantının ardından\\". Here, 'meeting' is 'toplantı', 'to protest' is 'protesto etmek', 'the destruction' is 'yıkımı' and 'a controversial monument in the eastern city of Kars is \\"Kars'taki tartışmalı bir anıt\\".

The term \\"crime\\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\\"a public wrong\\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - The Case of the Lucky Legs is a 1935 mystery film , the third in a series of Perry Mason films starring Warren William as the famed lawyer . - Perry Mason is a fictional character, a criminal defense lawyer who is the main character in works of detective fiction written by Erle Stanley Gardner. Perry Mason is featured in more than 80 novels and short stories, most of which involve a client's murder trial. Typically, Mason establishes his client's innocence by implicating another character, who then confesses. - Mystery film is a genre of film that revolves around the solution of a problem or a crime. It focuses on the efforts of the detective, private investigator or amateur sleuth to solve the mysterious circumstances of an issue by means of clues, investigation, and clever deduction. - Warren William (born Warren William Krech; December 2, 1894 September 24, 1948) was a Broadway and Hollywood actor, immensely popular during the early 1930s; he was later nicknamed the \\"King of Pre-Code\\".

After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: \\"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\\" He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March 1843.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.\\"?

You could break your arm at gymnastics. Do you want to stop going to the gym?\\" \\"No, of course not!\\" she replied. And with a determined spirit, she stood up and agreed to try again. I held on to the back of her bike until she found the courage to say, \\"Let's go!\\" I spent the rest of the afternoon at the park watching a very brave little girl overcome a fear, and congratulating myself for being an independent single parent. As we walked home, pushing the bike as we made our way along the sidewalk, she asked me about a conversation she'd overheard me having with my mother the night before. \\"Why were you and Grandma arguing last night?\\" \\"It's nothing.\\" I told her. She shrugged . \\"Grandma said she just wanted you to find someone to love.\\" \\"What Grandma wants is for some guy to break my heart again,\\" I snapped. \\"But Mom ...\\" \\"You're too young to understand.\\" I told her. She was quiet for the next few minutes. Then she looked up and in a small voice said, \\"So I guess love isn't like a broken arm.\\" Unable to answer, we walked the rest of the way in silence.

I thought that \\"Scary Movie\\" although not a great movie was very good and funny. \\"Scary Movie 2\\" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid. The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy. Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag out way to long. Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless. Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in \\"Scary Movie\\" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. But this time around it was out of place and not funny. The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film. Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie. But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film. Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.

The force justified their decision, stating that the proper procedures were followed, and the decision to caution was deemed most suitable in this particular case. This incident opens up a broader discussion on the prevalence and consequences of revenge porn, as well as the effectiveness of legal penalties in addressing this growing problem. Police Force's Statement In a statement, the unnamed police force made it clear that it believed its decision to caution the offender was the correct course of action. They emphasized that the case was carefully assessed by their investigators and that the force was convinced that administering a caution was proportionate and adequate based on the circumstances and the man's previous criminal history. It is important to note that a caution still carries legal consequences and may appear on the individual's criminal record, potentially affecting their employment prospects and social standing. Moreover, the police force pointed out that the victim was consulted during the decision-making process and was informed of the outcome. The Growing Problem of Revenge Porn Revenge porn refers to the act of sharing explicit or intimate images or videos of an individual without their consent, typically with the intent to cause distress or humiliation. In most cases, it involves former partners seeking to exact revenge on their exes. The rise of social media and the ease of sharing intimate content online have unfortunately created a fertile ground for this malicious activity to flourish. In recent years, countries around the world have acknowledged the potential damage revenge porn can cause, leading to the enactment of laws and regulations criminalizing it. These laws aim to tackle the problem by holding offenders accountable and deterring individuals from engaging in this despicable behavior. In some jurisdictions, victims of revenge porn can also seek damages through civil lawsuits. The Effectiveness of Legal Penalties Determining the best approach to penalize perpetrators of revenge porn remains a subject of debate. Some critics argue that cautions, like the one issued in this case, are too lenient and do little to deter potential perpetrators. They feel that a stronger legal response, such as imprisonment or hefty fines, would be more effective at sending a clear message that revenge porn will not be tolerated. On the other hand, proponents of cautions argue that they can be a suitable option in particular circumstances, provided that they are issued judiciously and with the involvement of the victim. Conclusion The police force's decision to caution a man who posted revenge porn images online has provoked a wider discussion about the adequacy of current legal penalties in addressing this issue. While varying opinions exist on the effectiveness of cautions, it is crucial for law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate each case and apply the appropriate legal response in consultation with the victim, as done in this instance. Ultimately, as society continues to grapple with the ever-evolving challenges posed by the digital age, it is essential that laws, law enforcement techniques, and public awareness campaigns continue to adapt and evolve in response to combat revenge porn and support those affected by this harmful behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? does n't deliver a great story , Available options: -- negative. -- positive.","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"does n't deliver a great story,\\" is negative. This sentence implies that the subject being discussed has not successfully provided a compelling narrative or experience for the reader or viewer. The use of \\"doesn't\\" (with a small typographical error in the sentence) conveys a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction, as it implies a lack of fulfillment in terms of the story being told. The sentence structure and choice of words contribute to a negative sentiment. When constructing a statement, the use of negative contractions (e.g., \\"doesn't,\\" \\"isn't,\\" or \\"wasn't\\") typically conveys a sense opposite to the meaning of the original verb. In this case, \\"deliver\\" implies achievement or satisfaction, but the contraction \\"doesn't\\" negates that meaning, suggesting that the subject falls short of providing a great story. Furthermore, the use of the word \\"great\\" indicates a higher-than-normal expectation of quality or enjoyment for the story. By saying that it doesn't deliver a \\"great\\" story, the speaker is suggesting that the outcome was far from meeting these expectations, which further strengthens the negative sentiment being conveyed. In conclusion, based on the language and structure of the given sentence, the sentiment is clearly negative. This assessment is supported by the presence of the contraction \\"doesn't,\\" which negates the positive verb \\"deliver,\\" and the adjective \\"great,\\" which indicates high expectations that were not met.

A:","completion":"Team A conducted a less safe experiment by heating a can of soup without venting it first. This is because heating an unvented can causes the pressure inside to build up due to the expanding gases and increasing temperature. Eventually, this increased pressure may cause the can to burst or explode, potentially leading to burns, injuries, or damage in the vicinity. In contrast, Team B took precautionary measures by venting the can of soup before heating it.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this. Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers, Messiah of Evil has potential, but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off. The premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back. It doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror. The surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon', a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later, the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded, murderous, squirrel-eating albino. Part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way. Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the 'intentional', the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - WRAP SCENE' blur hopelessly. Take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug-addled, feverish, stream-of-consciousness way, one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father, and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary. While we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture, Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be. The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse, bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'Dark Stranger' who came from the woods one day. In the meantime Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of years (you can hear the MST3K line already: 'man is dead, only his capitalist food tins remain') and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater. I generally think that the surreal works in careful, well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal? Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand. When the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks. The general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark, the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either. Add to that the choppy editing, average acting and Hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and I'd file Messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it's not particularly gory, trashy or sleazy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What would spur someone to walk up to a war memorial, fatally shoot a soldier guarding it, then rush into Canada's Parliament and open fire? The attacker, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, may have taken the answer to his grave when he himself was shot dead before he could seriously hurt anyone inside Parliament. Yet, bit by bit, we're learning about the 32-year-old Zehaf-Bibeau, a man with a criminal record and, according to a friend, an unstable mind. Investigators are digging to find out more. One thing they already know, though, is that the bloodshed is \\"a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,\\" according to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Here's what we know so far about Michael Zehaf-Bibeau:. He's the son of a Libyan father, Canadian mother. He was born October 16, 1982, to father Bulgasem Zehaf and mother Susan Bibeau, according to court documents tied to his parents' 1999 divorce. His father is from Libya, while his mother is Canadian, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said. The Globe and Mail newspaper described the father, Zehaf, as a businessman. Zehaf-Bibeau's mother is the deputy chairwoman of the immigration division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, according to her official profile. She's been with that agency since 1990, having worked as a refugee protection officer, legal adviser and manager of operational support, among other roles. \\"I know that the mother was very caring and a very involved parent. Actually both parents seem to have been,\\" Janice Parnell, a former neighbor, told CNN partner network CTV. \\"The boy seemed to have had a very good upbringing. He had a good home base. He was involved in community things.\\" He lived in several places in Canada. According to Canadian media reports, Zehaf-Bibeau worked as a miner and a laborer at various points in his life. Not only did he change jobs, he changed places. Born in Montreal, Zehaf-Bibeau also lived in Calgary and most recently in Vancouver, according to Paulson. He had a criminal record. One way that authorities traced Zehaf-Bibeau's past was by following his criminal record. Paulson said that Zehaf-Bibeau's \\"record indicated infractions related to drugs, violence and other criminal activities.\\" Specifically, court documents obtained by CNN partner network CBC reveal Zehaf-Bibeau was charged with drug possession in Quebec in 2004. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. In 2011, he was charged with robbery and uttering threats in Vancouver, CBC reported. He was found guilty of only the second charge and sentenced to a day in jail. What, if anything, does this criminal record have to do with what happened Wednesday? The RCMP commissioner said that Zehaf-Bibeau \\"had a very developed ... non-national security criminality of violence and of drugs and of mental instability.\\" Investigators are trying to determine what role that criminal past, if any, played in Zehaf-Bibeau's radicalization and decision to attack Wednesday, Paulson said. Sergeant-at-arms hailed as 'hero' Prime Minister: 'Terrorist' killed soldier 'in cold blood' He asked to go to jail to overcome crack addiction. In December 2011, as part of a psychiatric evaluation prior to a trial in Vancouver, Zehaf-Bibeau said \\"he wants to be in jail as he believes this is the only way he can overcome his addiction to crack cocaine,\\" according to a psychiatric assessment provided by a Canadian court. The 2011 assessment continues, \\"He has been a devoted Muslim for seven years and he believes he must spend time in jail as a sacrifice to pay for his mistakes in the past.\\" The psychiatric expert who completed the assessment wrote, \\"I am unable to find any features of signs of a mental illness.\\" \\"Although he seems to be making an unusual choice, this is insufficient basis for a diagnosis of mental disorder,\\" the expert said. A convert to Islam, he had 'radical views' As mentioned , Zehaf-Bibeau converted to Islam about a decade ago. At some point after that, he became radicalized -- though officially haven't specified when or who he rubbed elbows with. Paulson, the RCMP commissioner, spoke Thursday about Zehaf-Bibeau's radicalization as well as his \\"association with some individuals who may have shared his radical views.\\" Asked later what he meant by \\"association,\\" the national police commissioner said Zehaf-Bibeau's \\"email was found in the hard drive of somebody who was charged with a terrorist-related offense. \\"What does that mean?\\" the commissioner asked. \\"We need to understand what that means.\\" Some found his behavior troubling. Zehaf-Bibeau was asked to stop attending prayers at the mosque he attended because elders found his behavior \\"erratic,\\" a friend told the Globe and Mail. The friend, Dave Bathurst, said Zehaf-Bibeau once told him the \\"devil is after him,\\" and frequently talked about supernatural spirits. \\"I think he must have been mentally ill,\\" Bathurst told the paper. He wanted to go to Syria, couldn't get passport. Zehaf-Bibeau spoke of wanting to go to the Middle East to study. Bathurst, the friend, told the Globe and Mail that he \\"urged his friend to make sure study was on his mind and not something else.\\" More specifically, his mother told authorities Wednesday that her son \\"wanted to travel to Syria,\\" according to Paulson. He applied for a passport, which was \\"subject to an investigation,\\" at the time of the Ottawa attack, the commissioner said. \\"I think the passport figured prominently in his motives and -- I'm not inside his head -- but I think it was central to what was driving him,\\" Paulson said. He visited the U.S. at least four times. U.S. law enforcement officials are tracing back Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's travel to the United States and interviewing people with whom he came into contact, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. He visited at least four times, most recently in 2013, the official said. There's no reason to believe he's connected to any extremists in the United States, the official said. He had 'connections' to jihadists, wasn't necessarily part of a big network. Zehaf-Bibeau had \\"connections\\" to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday. According to two U.S. counterterrorism officials, Zehaf-Bibeau was connected to Hasibullah Yusufzai through social media. Yusufzai is wanted by Canadian authorities for traveling overseas to fight alongside Islamist fighters in Syria, The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, reported. Other radicalized individuals connected to Zehaf-Bibeau are still believed to be in Canada, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. Early indications are that his connections involved \\"interactions\\" online, including via Islamic extremist websites, a U.S. source told CNN. There is no evidence so far that Zehaf-Bibeau had any \\"operational links\\" to other jihadists, according to the source, who drew a distinction between interacting online and plotting an attack. And when asked Thursday by CNN's Christiane Amanpour if Zehaf-Bibeau is linked to a wider network of jihadists, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said \\"there's no evidence, at this stage, for us to know that. ... That's something authorities are looking at right now.\\" He was not on a Canadian list of possible extremists. Whatever his associations, Zehaf-Bibeau wasn't high on Canadian authorities radar when it comes to potential terrorist attacks. He was not among about 90 individuals that Canadian authorities are examining for possible Islamic extremist ties. \\"Had we have known that he wanted to travel to Syria, and had we had some basis to suspect that he wanted to do that for a criminal purpose, then he certainly would have been\\" on that list, Paulson said. The commissioner also noted, \\"There is no one path or formula to ... radicalization. And understanding each individual's path to that state is the challenge.\\" He recently came to Ottawa, was staying at shelter. Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau had been in the Canadian capital since at least October 2. During those few weeks, he stayed at the Ottawa Mission shelter, according to residents there. One resident, who asked to be identified only as Brian, recalled running into Zehaf-Bibeau -- who was then chanting and praying -- on the shelter's stairs the night before the attack. \\"I just walked by and I started singing (a Christian song),\\" Brian said. \\"And it didn't affect him at all. He just kept going.\\" Perhaps related to his short time there, Zehaf-Bibeau didn't frequent mosques in Ottawa, according to Aymler mosque imam Mohammed Lahlou. \\"We have no clue about that person,\\" Lahlou said. \\"And that kind of person should not have any place in our community.\\" He is believed to have acted alone. All day Wednesday, Canadian officials vacillated back and forth on whether Zehaf-Bibeau acted alone. By Wednesday night, they settled on the answer: yes. \\"It appears there was just one shooter and that shooter is dead,\\" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told CNN's Anderson Cooper. He's not connected to a similar incident this week. On Monday, a man who Canadian authorities said was \\"radicalized\\" killed a Canadian soldier with his car in Quebec. That man, Martin Rouleau Couture, was then shot and killed. Paulson said Thursday that investigators have not found any link between Couture and Zehaf-Bibeau. Prime Minister: 'Terrorist' killed soldier 'in cold blood' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was a 32-year-old Canadian man with a criminal record and a history of mental instability. He had converted to Islam around a decade prior to his attack on a war memorial and Canada's Parliament. Zehaf-Bibeau had been staying at an Ottawa shelter before the attack, and authorities now believe he acted alone in the incident. Zehaf-Bibeau was born in Montreal and had also lived in Calgary and Vancouver. He had a criminal record related to drugs, violence, and other criminal activities. Authorities are looking into whether his criminal past played any role in his radicalization. He had expressed a desire to travel to Syria but was unable to get a passport. He was found to have connections to jihadists, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria. Still, Zehaf-Bibeau was not on a Canadian list of possible extremists, and there is no evidence so far that he had any operational links to other jihadists. It is still uncertain what exactly led to Zehaf-Bibeau's attack and his motivations.

Which language is this?","completion":"The given text \\"Onnittelen häntä siitä\\" is in Finnish, which is one of the official languages of Finland and is also spoken in some parts of Sweden. Finnish is a member of the Uralic language family, specifically belonging to the Finno-Ugric branch, making it closely related to Estonian and more distantly related to Hungarian. The phrase \\"Onnittelen häntä siitä\\" translates to \\"I congratulate him/her for that\\" or \\"I congratulate them on that\\" in English. In this sentence, \\"Onnittelen\\" means \\"I congratulate,\\" \\"häntä\\" refers to \\"him/her,\\" and \\"siitä\\" translates to \\"for that.\\" Finnish is known for its agglutinative morphology, meaning that words can be constructed by adding various suffixes and other elements to the base, allowing for complex and lengthy expressions. This feature is prominent in the Uralic languages. Finnish is known for its intricate grammar system and vowel harmony rules, which might make it challenging for non-native speakers to learn. It does not have gendered pronouns, and it uses the same word, \\"hän,\\" for both \\"he\\" and \\"she.\\" Additionally, Finnish has 15 grammatical cases, influencing the way words change their forms and endings to denote their function in a sentence. Overall, the Finnish language is a fascinating and unique member of the Uralic languages and is an essential part of the Finnish culture and identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

We have the equation 3289*u - 98 = 3387*u. Think of \\"u\\" as the number of apples you have. We need to find out how many apples you have by solving for \\"u\\". First, we want to have u (apples) by itself on one side of the equation. Step 1: Let's make the number of apples (u) at the same side. To do this, we'll subtract 3289*u from both sides: 3289*u - 3289*u - 98 = 3387*u - 3289*u This simplifies to: -98 = 98*u Now we have -98 = 98*u. Step 2: To find the number of apples (u), we'll divide both sides by 98: (-98) / 98 = (98*u) / 98 This simplifies to: -1 = u So, the answer is u = -1.

From the uninspired plot to the lackluster performances, this movie quickly became a tiresome affair devoid of any genuine emotional depth or engagement. The storyline, which had potential to captivate the audience, unfortunately faltered under the weight of its own predictability. As the plot unfolded, it quickly became apparent that the screenwriters took the easy route and opted for clichés and overused tropes, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and disconnected from the narrative. The characters, sadly, were no better; they were one-dimensional and failed to evoke any empathy or connection. The actors clearly tried to make the best of their roles, but it felt as though they were being let down by the script. The dialogue was stilted and unrealistic, and it was difficult to see the motives and emotions behind the characters' actions. Visually, the film was lacking in its ability to create memorable scenes or any sense of grandiosity. The special effects were mediocre at best, and it seemed that the budgetary constraints were holding the production back from reaching its full potential. This resulted in a visual experience that was far from immersive or impactful. Ultimately, [Insert Movie Title] is a disappointing film that does not live up to its potential. It is a frustrating experience that leaves you feeling dissatisfied with the end product.

Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey. Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers. The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations.

On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

The research found that people who watched a movie in 3D improved cognitive skills, compared to those who watched it in 2D. The research was led by neuroscientist Dr Patrick Fagan from Goldsmiths University in London. More than 100 people took part in the experiment, where participants watched Disney filmBig Hero 6in either standard format or RealD 3D. They also carried out a brain-training-style test before and after seeing a section from the film. The test covered memory, reaction times and cognitive function and the results were compared later. According to the research, which was carried out in partnership with science group Thrill Laboratory, participants experienced a 23 percent increase in cognitive processing, as well as an 11 percent increase in reaction times. Dr Fagan said that the results showed enough of an improvement in brain function to suggest that 3D could play a part in improving brain power in the future. \\"These findings are more significant than you might think,\\" he said. \\"It is a fact that people are living longer and there is a noticeable decline in cognitive brain function in old age which can worsen future quality of life.

You can provide timothy hay in racks and hay balls, but be aware that chinchillas are known for getting stuck in them. Providing hay gives your chinchilla necessary fiber. Chewing hay helps them avoid tooth overgrowth. Pellets provide your chinchilla with a variety of vitamins and nutrients. Choose a pellet that is designed for chinchilla nutrition needs and follow the instructions provided with it for portion sizing. Place the pellets in a food dish and make sure that dish is cleaned daily before the pellets are put in it. Most adult chinchillas should eat around 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of pellets every day, depending on what type of pellets they are given. Feeding them other snacks too frequently can cause digestive problems. Safe treats include raisins, carrots, apple, oats, dried blackberry leaves, rose petals from plants that have not been sprayed with poisons of any kind, unsweetened cheerios, unsweetened shredded wheat, dried rose hips, and safe wood chew sticks. However, these should be given in very small servings and should only be given once or twice a week. Never give fruit, vegetables, nuts, or other treats that are not listed as safe.

The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for Perdiccas III (r. 368 – 359 BC), younger brother of Alexander II, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365 BC. The remainder of Perdiccas III's reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery. However, an Athenian invasion led by Timotheus, son of Conon, managed to capture Methone and Pydna, and an Illyrian invasion led by Bardylis succeeded in killing Perdiccas III and 4,000 Macedonian troops in battle.

London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Belfast, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield all have big arenas while Bristol has a £92m venue planned, The Welsh Government wants to ensure south Wales can compete with other areas of the UK for major music concerts and sporting events. Cardiff council acknowledge it is a \\"major priority\\" and Russell Goodway, cabinet member for investment and development, said: \\"We intend to bring forward our plans in the next few months.\\" London, Manchester and Birmingham, for example, are hosting Lady Gaga on her 2017 world tour while the recently-opened Glasgow's SSE Hydro hosted star American gymnast Simone Biles at the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championship. The government's major events team, which helped bring football's 2017 Champions League and Ashes cricket Tests to Cardiff, want a venue capable of staging similar events.

Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade Affirmed returned to racing in early August in the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga. He nearly became an upset loser to the front-running Sensitive Prince but closed in the last 100 yards in a race that Laz Barrera considered one of Affirmed's finest efforts. Alydar and Affirmed met once more, in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga. Affirmed, piloted by Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay substituting for the injured Cauthen, cut off Alydar entering the far turn, causing his rival to hit the rail and almost go down, losing six lengths before recovering his stride. Affirmed finished first but was disqualified and placed second. The horses never met again, and the final winning tally stood at Affirmed 7, Alydar 3. Affirmed then prepared to meet another major rival: 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew. The 1978 Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap marked the first time in racing history that two Triple Crown winners ever met in a race. Seattle Slew was a speed horse and got the first quarter mile in 24 seconds under jockey Angel Cordero, who never allowed Affirmed to get close. Seattle Slew won by three lengths in 1:45 4/5 for the one-turn mile and 1/8. The two horses met once more, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. This time, Affirmed was to be aided by his stablemate Life's Hope, who was entered in the race to extend Seattle Slew in the early stages. However, Affirmed's saddle slipped during the race, leaving his jockey with almost no control. He tired to finish unplaced for the only time in his career as Exceller and jockey Willie Shoemaker defeated Seattle Slew by a nose. As a three-year-old, Affirmed won 8 of 11 starts with 2 seconds and 1 unplaced run, for earnings of 901,541.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Question: What could happen to guns if they are wet? Options: - misfire - explode - jam - break - take life The answer is \\"misfire\\" because Answer:","completion":"When guns are exposed to water or moisture, several issues can arise that may impact their performance and safety. The four primary effects of wet conditions on guns include misfire, jam, break, or, in rare cases, explode. 1. Misfire: A misfire occurs when the primer in the cartridge fails to ignite the gunpowder due to the presence of water or moisture. This prevents the gun from firing properly and can be a common issue with wet firearms. 2. Jam: A jam is when the gun's moving parts do not cycle correctly, preventing proper loading, chambering, or ejecting ammunition. Wet conditions can cause rust, corrosion, or debris accumulation, which can lead to jamming issues. 3. Break: Wet conditions can cause metal components of the gun to rust and weaken over time, which may lead to them breaking. Additionally, wooden parts of the gun may absorb moisture, causing them to warp or crack. 4. Explode: Explosions can happen in rare instances when water seeps into the barrel and gets trapped between the bullet and the chamber. When the gun is fired, the water cannot escape quickly enough, and the pressure buildup can cause the barrel or chamber to rupture, resulting in an explosion. This is an uncommon occurrence, but it is still a potential risk with wet firearms. While \\"take life\\" is not a direct consequence of a gun being wet, it is essential to note that mishandling firearms or using them in unsafe conditions can lead to unintended harm or even fatalities. All firearms should be treated with respect and stored, cleaned, and used according to proper safety guidelines."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Engine A has a high vapor pressure, but engine B has a low vapor pressure. He noticed that to increase the speed of the engines he needed to increase the vapor pressure. and a hint : Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. Please answer this question : Would engine A have higher or lower temperature than engine B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Engine A would have a higher temperature than Engine B. The relationship between vapor pressure and temperature is directly proportional, meaning that as the temperature of a substance increases, so does its vapor pressure. In the given situation, Engine A has a higher vapor pressure compared to Engine B. Consequently, this implies that Engine A's temperature is higher than that of Engine B. The vapor pressure is a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when the substance is in equilibrium, with the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases remaining constant. An increase in temperature provides the liquid molecules in the two engines with more kinetic energy, enabling more of them to overcome the intermolecular forces, escape the liquid phase, and enter the gas phase. As a result, the vapor pressure rises. Since Engine A has a higher vapor pressure, it is evident that a greater number of its liquid molecules have overcome the intermolecular forces and passed into the gas phase. This increased vapor pressure contributes to an augmentation of the engine's overall speed. In comparison, Engine B, which has a lower vapor pressure, will operate at a lower temperature, and subsequently, lower speed. In summary, Engine A's higher temperature ensures that a larger number of liquid molecules can successfully escape into the gas phase, leading to elevated vapor pressure. Consequently, this higher vapor pressure allows Engine A to operate at a faster speed than Engine B, which has a lower temperature and vapor pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of Sir John Baker's daughter? Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by Sir John Baker. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West. By the 18th century the Baker's fortunes had waned, and the house, renamed Sissinghurst Castle, was leased to the government to act as a prisoner-of-war camp during the Seven Years' War.

One study involved sixty-eight healthy young women and men who ran at least twenty-four kilometers a week. The runners were observed on a treadmill machine . Sometimes they wore running shoes. Other times they ran barefoot . Researchers from the JKM Technologies company in Virginia, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado did the study. They found that running shoes create more stress that could damage knees, hips and ankle joints than running barefoot. They observed that the effect was even greater than the effect reported earlier for walking in high heels. The study appeared in the official scientific journal of The American Academy of Physical Medicine. The other study appeared in the journal Nature. It compared runners in the United States and Kenya. The researchers were from Harvard University in Massachusetts, Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. They divided the runners into three groups. One group had always run shoeless. Another group had always run with shoes. And the third group had changed to shoeless running. Runners who wear shoes usually come down heel first. That puts great force on the back of the foot. But the study found that barefoot runners generally land on the front or middle of their foot. That way they ease into their landing and avoid striking their heel. Harvard's Daniel Lieberman led the study. He says the way most running shoes are designed may explain why those who wear them land on their heels. The heel of the shoe is bigger and heavier than other parts of the shoe, so it would seem more likely to come down first. Also, the heel generally has thick material under it to soften landings. But the researchers do not suggest that runners immediately start running barefoot. They say it takes some training. And there can be risks, like running when your feet are too cold to feel if you get injured. The study was partly supported by Vibram,... What's the main idea of the passage? A) Walking in high heels could cause less serious effects than running barefoot. B) Two new discoveries encourage people to run in high heels. C) Running in shoes is partly good to runners.

Instead, I shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film. 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography. 2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be, by sharing Cybill Shepherd's (his then-gal) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just on one but on two occasions. Brava! The unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta. 3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic). - Slovakia, officially the Slovak Republic, is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east and Hungary to the south. Slovakia's territory spans about and is mostly mountainous. The population is over 5 million and comprises mostly ethnic Slovaks. The capital and largest city is Bratislava. The official language is Slovak, a member of the Slavic language family. - The Margraviate of Brandenburg was a major principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1157 to 1806. Also known as the March of Brandenburg (\\"), it played a pivotal role in the history of Germany and Central Europe. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The Duchy of Prussia or Ducal Prussia was a duchy in eastern Prussia established during the Protestant Reformation in 1525. It was the first Lutheran duchy with a dominant German-speaking population, as well as Polish and Lithuanian minorities. In old texts and in Latin, the term \\"Prut(h)enia\\" refers alike to \\"Ducal Prussia\\", its western neighbor Royal Prussia, and their common predecessor, Teutonic Prussia. The adjectival form of the name was \\"Prut(h)enic\\". - The concept of Germany as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander Julius Caesar, who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as \\"Germania\\", thus distinguishing it from Gaul (France), which he had conquered. The victory of the Germanic tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) prevented annexation by the Roman Empire, although the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established along the Rhine. Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks conquered the other West Germanic tribes. When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charlemagne's heirs in 843, the eastern part became East Francia. In 962, Otto I became the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the medieval German state. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - A unitary state is a state governed as a single power in which the central government is ultimately supreme and any administrative divisions (sub-national units) exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government. Of the 193 UN member states, 165 of them are governed as unitary states. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. - The German Revolution or November Revolution was a civil conflict in the German Empire at the end of the First World War that resulted in the replacement of Germany's Imperial government with a republic. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the establishment in August 1919 of a republic that later became known as the Weimar Republic. - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs.

As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies. - Brandenburg (Lower Sorbian: \\"Bramborska\\") is one of the sixteen federated states of Germany. It lies in the northeast of the country covering an area of 29,478 square kilometers and has 2.48 million inhabitants. The capital and largest city is Potsdam.

Movie title: Sick Girl Movie plot: Ida Teeter (Angela Bettis) is a shy entomologist who has a wide variety of insects all over her home, which caused her girlfriend to break up with her. Ida is introduced to the beautiful and strange girl Misty Falls (Erin Brown a.k.a. Misty Mundae), and is drawn to her. A mysterious package arrives for Ida one day, containing a large unidentifiable mantis-like insect. Landlady Lana Beasley is concerned with Ida's âpetsâ and the effect that may be laid upon her ten-year-old granddaughter Betty, who likes to disguise herself as a ladybug. Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is introduced to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max. Ida returns to find Misty asleep on the couch. She returns with a pillow (that has Mick inside) to give to Misty. In gratitude for Ida allowing her to stay, Misty returns the favor by seducing Ida. Unknowingly, Mickâs proboscis nips Misty's ear, which Misty dismisses. The next morning, Ida awakens to find that Misty has discovered her secret bug stash and has a great interest in bugs. They spend more time together, although Misty becomes weak and begins displaying unusual tendencies. Misty later comes across the pillow with Mick in it, and discovers that she has strange urges to lie next to it; the insect invades her much-chewed and saliva-doused ear with its proboscis.

This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers films, or at least one of my favorites. Most of the A-R movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories. This still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films. This movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs. The music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a tap solo by Rogers. She not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure. She dances also with Fred, of course, and they're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor. Growing up in the 1950s watching \\"Ozzie & Harriet\\" on television, it was a real kick the first time I saw this to see such a young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although she had that short early '30s hairstyle, I recognized her voice right away. Also in this movie are quick appearances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I have yet to out Ball. I can't find her, but I know she's in here. Astaire, except for some obnoxious gum-chewing in the first third of the film, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - although better in westerns - is likable, too. This is simply a nice, feel-good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is decidedly positive. The reviewer clearly views the film in high regard, appreciating not only the classic elements of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' performances but also the distinctive features the film offers. The reviewer commends the film's strong musical component, celebrates the presence of multiple likable characters, and appreciates the addition of a tap solo by Rogers to the movie. The reviewer finds joy in recognizing Harriet Hilliard from \\"Ozzie & Harriet\\" and seems to emotionally connect with seeing her in a much earlier role in her career. Although the reviewer comments on Astaire's gum-chewing as obnoxious, this appears more of an amusing curiosity rather than a substantive criticism of the film. Similarly, the note about Randolph Scott being better in westerns serves as a mild critique that doesn't significantly detract from the reviewer's overall appreciative outlook. Another strong marker of the review's positive sentiment is the language the reviewer uses, with descriptions like \\"not just great dancing but likable characters,\\" \\"always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor,\\" and \\"a nice, feel-good film.\\" These phrases ooze positivity and enthusiasm toward the film. Finally, the fondness felt when the reviewer mentions being unable to spot Lucille Ball is potentially another indication of their positive sentiment—the act of trying to engage with the film at deeper, even trivial, levels often reflects an affinity for it. In summary, the reviewer reflects ample enjoyment and appreciation for the film, resulting in an overwhelmingly positive review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

New President’s Council to Focus on Kids and Money President Obama has authorized a private-sector advisory council focused squarely on young people's ability to learn about money. Student debt and early retirement saving are high on the hit list. Flying somewhat under the radar, President Obama last month authorized another commission to help raise financial awareness—this one focused solely on young people. Members will be selected from the private sector over the next few months, and the group should hold its first meeting by the end of the year. We already have a Financial Literacy and Education Commission comprising the heads of 21 federal agencies including Treasury and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This group put together our national strategy for financial education and runs MyMoney.gov, an impartial personal finance website. We also have had a President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability comprising private-sector leaders in finance and education. This group issued its final report in January offering ideas for improving personal finance education and was responsible for two helpful websites—moneyasyougrow.org, which details what kids should know about money at what age, and moneyasyoulearn.org, which offers teachers tools to integrate personal finance lessons into subject areas like math and English. Now we have the new President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans. As the name suggests, this puts the federal government’s focus on young people. That is precisely where it should be as it relates to raising the financial I.Q. of Americans. The new group’s mission will be to: Countries such as Australia and Britain have mandated that financial education be part of every school’s curricula, signaling the importance of reaching young people and making money decisions a natural part of their life. We have no such mandate in the U.S. and likely never will. But we’re making progress. The JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy and the Council for Economic Education, two leading nonprofits in the fight against global financial illiteracy, have crafted standards to help schools in all 50 states begin to teach personal finance. They were instrumental in creating a model that encourages and instructs teachers interested in taking on the mission. There is now a broad effort to get personal finance incorporated into the common core initiative, which 46 states have agreed to. Private sector organizations like the credit card company Visa and accounting firm PwC have contributed millions of dollars to train teachers. Personal financial know-how on a broad scale is seen as the best way to avoid another financial crisis.

However, to answer the question about Chopin's relations being fictionalized in movies, one needs to delve deeper into the content of \\"A Song to Remember\\" and see how Chopin's relationships are portrayed in the film. \\"A Song to Remember\\" primarily focuses on the relationship between Polish composer Frederic Chopin and French author George Sand (whose real name was Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin). The film takes a fictionalized look at the relationship between Chopin and George Sand, portraying Chopin as a sensitive and frail artist, while Sand is presented as a strong-willed and supportive partner who played a significant role in promoting Chopin's work. Although certain aspects of their relationship are exaggerated or fictionalized for dramatic effect, the film does depict one of Chopin's important relationships in his life. So, despite the provided sentence not answering the question directly, by exploring the content of \\"A Song to Remember,\\" one can provide a valid answer to the question about Chopin's relations being fictionalized in movies: the film fictionalizes Chopin's relationship with George Sand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are , of course , lots of differences as well . Their mindsets could not be more different . Question: Why do they believe Tolkien and Tezuka are key authors ?","completion":"The user believes that Tolkien and Tezuka are key authors because they both played significant roles in shaping the world of entertainment in the 20th century. Here's a step-by-step justification for this belief: 1. Impact on their respective fields: Both Tolkien and Tezuka had a strong impact on their respective fields. Tolkien, as a prominent author in the fantasy literature genre, created the well-known Middle-earth universe and various novels, including 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings.' Tezuka, on the other hand, was a Japanese manga artist, writer, and animator who is considered the \\"father of manga\\" and \\"godfather of anime.\\" He created Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, and Black Jack, among others. 2. Influence on future generations: Their works have left a lasting impression on authors and artists alike. Tolkien popularized the fantasy genre and inspired countless authors, including George R.R. Martin and J.K. Rowling. Tezuka, as a pioneer in the manga and anime industry, also inspired future creators like Hayao Miyazaki and Satoshi Kon. 3. Creation of expansive universes: Both Tolkien and Tezuka created intricate worlds with deep lore and characters. Tolkien's Middle-earth is a carefully crafted universe with its languages, history, and mythology. Tezuka's vast body of work features interconnected stories and recurrent characters while exploring various themes, which allows fans to immerse themselves even deeper into his creations. 4. Fostering fan communities and engagement: The significant impact of Tolkien and Tezuka's works generated substantial fan communities who bonded over shared love and appreciation for their storytelling. This led to the creation of fanfiction - stories written by fans that use the original works' characters and settings as a base. This increases engagement and keeps their legacies alive. 5. Variety in themes and messages: Despite their different mindsets, both Tolkien and Tezuka tackled various themes and imparted messages in their works. This allowed them to resonate with their readers/viewers on multiple levels and transcend cultural barriers, further establishing their significance as key authors in their respective fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The first is that their back story will be available online so there is no need to ask about it. The second is that there would not be enough time anyway. Debbie Jevans, the chief executive of next year's England 2015 Rugby World Cup was different - is different - which perhaps explains why the Guardian named her the most influential woman in British sport earlier this year. A cynic might say that sounds a bit like topping a list of famous Belgians, Welsh World Cup heroes or English lacrosse legends, and Jevans would probably agree. When the main funding bodies in British sport declared they wanted female representation of at least 25% on the boards of national governing bodies by 2017, Jevans did not mince her words. \\"Is it ambitious enough? I don't think so,\\" she said. \\"Surely we've got to be aiming at 50%. \\"The talent is out there, the problem is that too often the default position is to see jobs in sport as male.\\" But the thing about default positions is they are usually triggered when something goes wrong - Jevans' life in sports administration seems to be an exercise in preventing that from ever happening. A former junior champion at Wimbledon, Jevans had a professional playing career that probably went under the radar at the time but would earn her a fortune now. Between 1979 and 1983, she played in 10 Grand Slam singles tournaments, with the highlight a run to the fourth round of Wimbledon that was ended by Virginia Wade. She also played a lot of doubles, reaching the quarter-finals of the mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 1978. Her partner was Andrew Jarrett, a man she would later marry. He is now Wimbledon's tournament referee. After her time on the pro circuit came to an end Jevans moved smoothly into the ranks of officialdom. By 1987, aged just 27, she was director of the women's game at the International Tennis Federation, and four years later she became general secretary. She then set up her own consultancy firm, working at one stage for the International Rugby Board in its bid to get rugby union back into the Olympics. But the really big break, or brave move, came in 2003 when she joined London's bid team for the 2012 Olympics. Her job was to draw up the budget and strategy for staging the sports (not building the venues!), a job she saw through to glorious completion nine hard, but happy, years later. Having managed 20,000 staff and a budget of £160m so successfully, it was not a surprise when she was given the chance to lead England Rugby 2015, an event that some claim is now the third biggest sports event in the world. Yet hers is a name the vast majority of British sports fans will not know, a face they have rarely seen on television, a voice they have rarely heard on the radio. And those previous six paragraphs of biography are pretty much all that is available for a woman who is well down the road to delivering her second global sports spectacular in three years. \\"I'd much rather be judged by the work of my team than talk about me,\\" she said when I tried to get her to talk about herself. \\"A public profile isn't important to me. But I will answer personal questions. Or you can at least ask them!\\" I tried for a bit - she is now amicably divorced from Jarrett, no kids, still plays doubles, born in Essex, lives in Chelsea, supports Leeds United. But half of the stuff we know about people with important jobs is none of our business. What matters is that they can do those jobs. Jevans can. \\"When I look back to the Olympics, what really made me happy was sitting in the stadium and just seeing how well everything went,\\" is her greatest memory of the greatest summer most British sports fans can remember. It went so well because Jevans and her team worked methodically from milestone to milestone - \\"proper milestones, not soft deadlines that can be missed\\" is how she describes it. She is following the same strategy for the Rugby World Cup. We were talking on the morning the window for registering for tickets was opened. A week before it had been the announcement of the tournament's training venues. A week later it would be a series of events to mark a \\"year to go\\". Now, a month on, Jevans is dealing with a problem she foresaw at least two years ahead. With demand for tickets, particularly England tickets, outstripping supply, the tournament risks being tarnished by cynical touts and their eye-watering prices. Nobody can accuse Jevans of sleepwalking into this. She spent the first two years of her job cajoling the Government to grant the Rugby World Cup the same legal protection from touts that the Olympics enjoyed and football gets. She failed, or was failed, but it is to her credit that she is not whining about it. \\"We lobbied Government about that but they decided against any new legislation,\\" she told me. \\"They didn't feel it was necessary. We have accepted that and respect the decision.\\" What Jevans did next was to put in place a series of measures that should at least limit the scope for blatant profiteering, and make sure as many genuine fans as possible can get to the games without second mortgages. If last month's public ballot for tickets is an indication of things to come, Jevans is very much on the case: calmly, quietly, but ever so effectively. It is a style that, despite my earlier bad joke about the lack of influential women in British sport, is becoming increasingly, and better-late-than-neverly, common. This year's magnificent Tour de France Grand Depart was understatedly engineered by another woman who earned her stripes with London 2012, Nicky Roche. Last year's well-regarded Rugby League World Cup was partly run by Sally Bolton, whose next trick will be to organise the 2017 World Athletics Championships. Throw Sport England's boss Jennie Price, UK Sport's chief executive Liz Nicholl and the Sports Minister Helen Grant into the mix and you have quite a sisterhood. Not content with shaking up one male-dominated sport, Jevans joined the Football League's board as an independent director this summer. \\"It's definitely getting better,\\" she acknowledged when I asked about the progress so many talented women were making in the higher ranks of British sport now. \\"But if I have a frustration it's that is has taken too long. It's great that people have been overt in their statements about equality, but it was frustrating. \\"We're getting there, though, and not just in sport. It's happening at FTSE-100 companies and in 'male' industries like construction. So the tide is turning.\\" Soon, the likes of Jevans will have washed away the last vestiges of a world where administrators were always, to paraphrase the former England rugby union captain Will Carling, boring, old, windy and male. Jevans is speaking at the Transforming Sport conference at Lord's on Thursday, 30 October.","completion":"Debbie Jevans, the most influential woman in British sports, is working hard to organize the 2015 Rugby World Cup and promote gender equality in sports administration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From dawn to dusk, we worked hard on that Economics project. I worked with each and every person in the group. I didn’t know how to plot a triple axis graph in excel, I learnt that day at 2 am. Our group also learnt many new things and we gave our 100% to that report. I, in my entire academic life, have never been careless towards the submission. I always submitted reports or assignments before time. Anyway, the submission day finally arrived. I had told one of the group members to print the report out and bind it and bring to the college with her. The lecture is scheduled at 2:00 pm. I called her for about 30 times asking where she was. She didn’t pick up any of our calls. There she entered the lecture hall at 2:07 pm and our professor being a strict one, rejected our project. Everything was washed out. Our efforts were washed away.

Q: Context: , commonly known as Tokyo Metro, is a rapid transit system in Tokyo, Japan. While it is not the only rapid transit system operating in Tokyo, it has the higher ridership among the two operators: in 2014, the Tokyo Metro had an average daily ridership of 6.84 million passengers, while the other system, the Toei Subway, had 2.85 million average daily rides., History. JR East was incorporated on 1 April 1987 after being spun off from the government-run Japanese National Railways (JNR). The spin-off was nominally \\"privatization\\", as the company was actually a wholly owned subsidiary of the government-owned JNR Settlement Corporation for several years, and was not completely sold to the public until 2002., Served by Shinkansen high-speed rail lines, Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo. It is the busiest station in Japan in terms of number of trains per day (over 3,000), and the fifth-busiest in Eastern Japan in terms of passenger throughput. It is also served by many regional commuter lines of Japan Railways, as well as the Tokyo Metro network., The is the name given to a 159.9 kilometre section of the Thoku Main Line between Ueno Station in Tokyo and Kuroiso Station in Nasushiobara , Tochigi , Japan . It is part of the East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) network . Service on the line has been extended to Tokyo Station via the Ueno - Tokyo Line ., High-speed rail is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of and existing lines in excess of are widely considered to be high-speed, with some extending the definition to include lower speeds in areas for which these speeds still represent significant improvements. The first such system began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the bullet train. High-speed trains normally operate on standard gauge tracks of continuously welded rail on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in its design., Lines. This station serves as the terminal station for two subsections of the JR East Tohoku Main Line, connecting the Utsunomiya Line (for , , and to the south and the Southern Thoku Main Line (for , , and to the north. It lies 163.3 km from the starting point of the line at . , The is a Japanese high-speed Shinkansen rail line, connecting Tokyo with Aomori in Aomori Prefecture in a route length of 674 km (419 miles), making it Japan's longest Shinkansen line. It runs through the more sparsely populated Thoku region of Japan's main island, Honshu, and is being extended as the Hokkaido Shinkansen through the Seikan Tunnel to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto (this section opened March 2016) and on to Sapporo by 2030. It has two Mini-shinkansen branch lines, the Yamagata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen. The line is operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East)., Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the ., The is a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan operated by five Japan Railways Group companies. Starting with the Tkaid Shinkansen in 1964, the network has expanded to currently consist of of lines with maximum speeds of , of Mini-shinkansen lines with a maximum speed of , and of spur lines with Shinkansen services. The network presently links most major cities on the islands of Honshu and Kyushu, and Hakodate on northern island of Hokkaido, with an extension to Sapporo under construction and scheduled to commence in March 2031. The nickname bullet train is sometimes used in English for these high-speed trains., The is a 575.7 km long railway line in Japan operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East). Although officially the line starts from Tokyo Station in Chiyoda, Tokyo, most of the long-distance trains actually begin at Ueno Station in Tait, Tokyo, and pass through such cities as Saitama, Utsunomiya, Fukushima, and Sendai, before reaching the end of the line in Morioka. The line originally extended to Aomori, but was truncated upon the extension of the Thoku Shinkansen beyond Morioka, which mostly parallels the Thoku Main Line., Ueno Station is close to Keisei-Ueno Station, the Tokyo terminus of the Keisei Main Line to Narita Airport Station., , abbreviated or \\"JNR\\", was the body which operated the national railway network of Japan from 1949 to 1987., The is a railway line of Japanese private railway company Keisei Electric Railway connecting Tokyo and Narita, Japan.

Article: Our body clock,or natural body rhythm,influences our energy and alertness.Paying attention to it can help us choose the suitable time of day when we best perform specific tasks. The reality,however,is that most of us organize their time around work demands,school deadlines,commuting or social events.Doing whatever your body feels like doing is a luxury in today's fast-paced modem society. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying.Obeying our body clock has significant health benefits.Disrupting our natural body rhythm,on the other hand,has been linked to problems such as depression,obesity,or headache,says Steve Key,a biology professor. When the body clock can synchronize(......)the rhythms of its natural processes,it \\"gives us an advantage in daily life\\",says Key. According to him,when it comes to cognitive work,most adults perform best in the late morning.As our body temperature starts to rise just before awakening in the morning and continues to increase until midday,our memory,alertness and concentration gradually improve. However,he adds,our ability to concentrate typically starts to decrease soon thereafter.Most of us are more easily distracted between noon and 4 pm. Alertness also tends to fall after eating a meal and sleepiness tends to peak around 2 pm,making that a good time for a nap. Surprisingly, tiredness may increase our creative powers.For most adults,problems that require open ended thinking are often best dealt with in the evening when they are tired, according to a study in the journal Thinking & Reasoning. When choosing a time of day to exercise,paying attention to your body clock can improve results.Physical performance is usually best from about 3 to 6 pm,says Michael Smolensky,a professor of biomedical engineering. Of course, not everyone's body clock is the same,making it even harder to synchronize natural rhythms with daily plans. Question: Which of the following is NOT true?

The words and their meanings are as follows: خیلی (khili) - very متاسفم (motaasafam) - sorry (I'm sorry) آیا (aaya) - whether, if ناراحتتون (naaraahatatoon) - upset you (your upset) کردم (kardam) - I did Step 3: Arrange the words appropriately in the target language (Portuguese) Now that I've understood the meaning of each word, my next step is to arrange them in a way that makes sense in Portuguese. I'll also make sure the grammar and structure of the sentence are consistent with the rules of the Portuguese language. Step 4: Provide the translated sentence in Portuguese Having arranged the words appropriately, the translated sentence in Portuguese would be: \\"Desculpe, eu te deixei chateado?\\" In this sentence, \\"Desculpe\\" means \\"I'm sorry\\", \\"eu te deixei\\" means \\"I made\\" or \\"I had caused\\", and \\"chateado\\" means \\"upset\\". The overall sentence conveys the meaning of the original Persian sentence, which is essentially asking whether the speaker has upset the other person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is a washed-up alcoholic baseball player who was a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners before getting kicked out of professional baseball for attacking an umpire. He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach. Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft), a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8â7. After the game, Buttermaker gives them non-alcoholic beer, and they spray it all over each other. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of trying, knowing that winning is not so important. Answer:","completion":"Considering the movie plot provided about Morris Buttermaker, a former professional baseball player turned children's baseball team coach who strives to make the underdog Bears team successful and eventually forms unexpected bonds, how do the team's initial struggles, as well as the introduction of skilled players like Amanda Whurlitzer and Kelly Leak, lead to the growth and development of personal relationships within the team and ultimately influence the outcome of the championship game, demonstrating the importance of camaraderie, perseverance, and learning that winning isn't everything in life?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In the original statement, a man dressed in black is standing behind three other people dressed in red and black. This suggests a gathering or situation where multiple individuals are present, and the people might be dressed in similar or coordinated attire. Fashion choices can often be indicators of an event, celebration, or social function. For example, formal wear or coordinated colors might suggest a wedding, gala event, or some other themed gathering. However, the sentence does not explicitly provide information on the setting, purpose, or nature of the gathering. The mention of people in an unspecified location does not necessarily confirm that they are at a party or social event. They could potentially be at a photoshoot, in a waiting area, or even participating in some other form of shared activity. Moving on to the sentence, \\"Some people are socializing at a party,\\" it can be considered a plausible assumption, given the presence of a group of individuals in apparently coordinated attire. The interpretation of socializing relies on the assumption that the people described in the original sentence are engaging in conversation and mingling with one another.

(Associated Press) \\"Now, instead of scaly animals portrayed as usually drab creatures, we have solid evidence for a fluffy colored past,\\" reports Mark A. Norell of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Examples of ancient feathers ranging from the simple to the complex are now being studied. They were preserved in amber found in western Canada, researchers led by Ryan C. McKellar of the University of Alberta report in Friday's edition of the journal Science. Amber, hardened tree resin, preserved a mixture of feathers from 70 million years ago. Other feathers contained in amber dating to 90 million years ago are less diverse. Specimens include simple filament structures similar to the earliest feathers of non-flying dinosaurs _ a form unknown in modern birds _ and more complicated bird feathers \\"displaying pigmentation and adaptations for flight and diving,\\" the researchers reported. Indications of feathers have been found on much older fossils, and the new discoveries indicate feathers continued to develop into modern form before the extinction of dinosaurs, explained Norell, who was not part of the research team. A separate report by Roy A. Wogelius of the University of Manchester, England, published online June 30 by Science, reports the finding of trace metals in feather fossils, suggesting their colors included black, brown and a reddish-brown. \\"Despite many reports over the past decade of feathered dinosaurs and new birds from China, only now are we beginning to understand just how diverse feather types were\\" millions of years ago, Norell said. ___ http://www.sciencemag.org ||||| A trove of ancient feathers both primitive and complex is providing scientists with an unprecedented snapshot of what some dinosaurs and birds looked like during the Cretaceous period. An account published online Thursday in the journal Science describes a host of feathers and feather-like filaments found in western Canada. The structures were ensconced in 70-million-year-old amber. Taken together, the feathers and filaments point to the diversity of this prehistoric plumed menagerie, said study coauthor Alexander Wolfe, a paleoecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada. \\"The simplest feathers are of greatest interest because these protofeathers have been inferred to be the evolutionary precedent to evolved feathers,\\" Wolfe said in an interview with The Times. Scientists have posited that feathers developed first as single, hair-like protrusions meant for insulation, then began to grow in clumps, and then as increasingly complex structures. At some point, they were probably used for other purposes (such as attracting mates), and later for flight. Many of the samples described in the study accurately match one of those stages. Some feathers even had coiled barbules, similar to those that have evolved on modern birds such as sandgrouses, which allow the animals to transport water to the nest to cool their incubating eggs. \\"We never thought we'd have fossils to show all these feathers, from primitive stage-one [protofeathers] to feathers of modern aspect,\\" Mark Norell, chairman of the division of paleontology at the American Museum of the Natural History, said in an interview with The Times. He was not involved in the study.

Credit: Science ||||| By Hans Villarica Protofeather fossils discovered entombed in amber from the Late Cretaceous era support theories of dinosaur and avian evolution -- and make for one beautiful gallery Dinosaur and bird feathers preserved in amber from a Late Cretaceous site in Canada reveal new insights into the structure, function, and color of animals that date back to about 78 million years ago. Researchers led by University of Alberta paleontologist Ryan McKellar say these specimens represent distinct stages of feather evolution, from early-stage, single filament protofeathers to much more complex structures associated with modern diving birds. After analyzing the preserved pigment cells, the authors add that these feathered creatures may have also had a range of transparent, mottled, and diffused colors, similar to birds today. They can't determine which feathers belonged to birds or dinosaurs yet, but they did observe filament structures that are similar to those seen in other non-avian dinosaur fossils. Their findings appear in the current issue of the journal Science. In the gallery below, with captions from McKellar, marvel at the beauty of these amber-preserved feathers. Then, in the Q&A that follows, learn more about how amber preservation works, the science of feather evolution, and the possibility of Jurassic Park-type experiments down the line. How significant is this discovery? This discovery is a pretty significant find. It supports a model for the evolution of feathers that has previously relied on compression fossils that are difficult to interpret and have been hotly debated. Also, the amber-entombed feathers show that some of the most primitive feather types, also known as protofeathers, were still around just before the dinosaurs went extinct. They existed alongside feathers that are nearly identical to those of modern birds. Given what we know about the animals that were alive in the area at the time, it is reasonable to suggest that the protofeather-like specimens are attributable to dinosaurs and are the first specimens of this type of feather to be recovered from amber. How does amber preservation work exactly? Preservation in amber can vary quite a bit among deposits. Amber tends to preserve specimens in great detail because tree resin has antibacterial and drying properties that partially mummify inclusions and slow the initial onslaught of decay. Over many years, the resin polymerizes, turning into a plastic-like substance that is quite resilient, but burial usually results in heating that can have a profound effect on the inclusions over the span of millions of years. The Canadian amber insect inclusions are largely preserved as hollow voids in the amber, with a thin film of carbonized, coal-like material, where the outside of the insect once was. The feathers appear to have fared much better, because they are fine and are not composed of material that decay easily. That said, many of the specimens show signs of partial decay, and there is no indication of how much, if any, original material remains intact. What's the backstory of these specimens? What originally got me interested in this project was a single feather fragment trapped in a spider web that had been given to Dr. Brian Chatterton. For my Ph.D. project, I worked on tiny, less than three millimeter, parasitic wasps trapped within amber from the same deposit. As part of this project I was able to go through the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology collection of 3,000 or so inclusions in great detail. After finding a lot of feather fragments in this collection, I had the good fortune of meeting the Leuck family, amateur collectors in southern Alberta, who donated a pair of additional specimens to the University of Alberta. Later, we learned that Dr. Philip Currie was also examining a trio of specimens from the deposit. We pooled the material, creating a surprisingly rich snapshot of feathers in the Late Cretaceous. This project underlines the importance of maintaining museum collections as well as the role that interested amateurs can play in palaeontology. Without these, there is no way that we would have been able to observe these important specimens. According to your paper, these feathers represent several distinct stages of feather evolution. Could you explain each stage briefly? The evolutionary-developmental model is an attempt to explain how the transition from small hair-like feathers to modern feathers with multiple tiers of branching occurred. A quick account of modern feather anatomy would go like this: Feathers have a central shaft called the rachis. Off of this shaft branch the tufts, which in turn branch off into small structures called barbules that are segmented like bamboo shoots. Stage 1 consists of individual filaments that are comparable to hair in terms of overall appearance. Stage 2 consists of multiple filaments that arise from a single base, forming barbs. Stage 3 is where feathers become branched structures, either by forming segmented barbules on their barbs or by forming barbs on their central shaft, the rachis, and then combining these features to make two tiers of branching. Stage 4 is where the barbules on each side of the barb were altered to connect barbs together and form a sheet or vaned feather. Stage 5 encompasses a wide range of finer alterations that actually permit powered flight and a wide range of additional uses for feathers. The notion of dinosaur specimens preserved in amber reminds me of Jurassic Park. Would what happened in that movie be plausible? What can we look forward to learning? Put simply, no. The specimens that we examined are extremely small and would not be expected to contain any DNA material. To put this into context, the only genetic material that has been recovered from amber is from lumps of mummified insect muscle tissue in much younger Dominican amber that are approximately 17 million years old and well after the age of dinosaurs. If we are able to obtain more material, we would really like to examine the chemical makeup of the protofeather-like specimens, as well as the pigments found within these specimens and other feathers. It would then be possible to investigate how much of the original feather material remains intact and gain a better understanding of the feathers' colors. Unfortunately, these investigations rely on being able to create small breaks within some of the specimens and examine them under very high magnifications, such as scanning electron microscopy, so they are not possible with the limited number of specimens that are currently available. A larger collection may also allow us to verify some of the other stages in feather evolution. ||||| Photo Color is coming to the formerly black-and-white Mesozoic world of dinosaurs and early birds. Not exactly high-definition color, and some formidable characters may show up in the same old drab and scaly wardrobes; they are dinosaurs, after all, with a reputation for resistance to change. But in time, you can look for splashes of color in museum dioramas of feathered figures from the age of dinosaurs. For more than a decade, hardly a season has passed without more discoveries of dinosaur and bird fossils in China bearing impressions of feathers and traces of chemical coloring agents. Now, in Canada, paleontologists have found 70-million-year-old amber preserving 11 specimens showing a wide diversity of feather types at that time. One specimen of so-called proto-feathers had a single bristlelike filament and some simple clusters. Others were complex structures with hooklike barbules that act like Velcro; in modern birds, this keeps feathers in place during dives. Still other specimens revealed feather patterns for flight and underwater diving. Preserved pigment cells encased in the amber, along with other evidence, suggested that the feathered animals had an array of mottled patterns and diffuse colors like modern birds, scientists at the University of Alberta, led by Ryan C. McKellar, said in a report published Thursday in the journal Science.

Question: what does girl take from father to meet her boyfriend? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Champagne Context: The Heiress Betty (Betty Balfour) draws the ire of her father after using his aeroplane to fly to her boyfriend (Jean Braden) on an ocean liner headed to France. French customs obviously, at the time, were not favorable to such behaviors. Even for daughters of wealthy men in the Champagne business. Marriage, in France, has always been preferred to casual relationships. Always uneasy due to seasickness, Betty's boyfriend is unable to dine with her. She notices a man watching her. He had been (briefly) watching her from a far, and sits to talk with her. Betty receives a telegram from her father who disapprovingly warns her the boyfriend is not going to be admired by her friends. To prove her father wrong she asks the boyfriend for his hand in marriage. A quarrel ensues during the trip and the two part company when it's over. The boyfriend regrets the fight and goes to Betty to apologize. He finds her excellence in chess, during a game with the mysterious man, to be quite surprising (he never took interest in her hobbies.) Another quarrel between the two is interrupted by the arrival of Betty's father (Gordon Harker). He tells Betty the family fortune, earned in the \\"champagne\\" business, has been wiped out in the stock market. The boyfriend leaves after hearing the news of their fortune.

A:","completion":"To determine whether this review would increase or decrease the chances of buying the product, I will analyze the review step by step. Step 1: Read the review title - \\"I'm with David Swanson here...\\" This suggests that the reviewer agrees with someone named David Swanson, whose opinion is not provided in this context. As a result, it is ambiguous and does not immediately sway my opinion either way. Step 2: Examine the reviewer's writing - \\"...I found it tediously written, with the constant whiny self-references...\\" Based on this statement, the reviewer found the product (a book) to be poorly written and annoying. This would generally decrease the chances of me buying the product. Step 3: Consider the reviewer's experience - \\"In my experience, no book every helped any of my kids toilet train.\\" The reviewer states that no books, including this one, have helped with toilet training. This suggests that the reviewer had a negative experience with this book, decreasing the chances of me buying it. Step 4: Analyze the reviewer's expectations - \\"That's not Frankel's fault, but when I hear accolades, I at least expect a clever book, even if it didn't help in my particular case.\\" Here, the reviewer recognizes that the book's lack of help might not be the author's fault. They still expected a \\"clever book\\" due to the positive reviews, even if it didn't help with toilet training. Their expectations were not met, which further decreases my interest in the product. Conclusion: Based on this review, the chances of me buying the product would decrease.

Q:Question: The matter in side a can of soda is in what state? Options: - vending machine - pop - store - liquid - picnic cooler Explain why a human would choose \\"liquid\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"liquid\\" as the answer to the question above because, among the given options, it is the state that accurately reflects the physical condition of the matter inside a can of soda. The question aims to identify the phase or state of matter that the content of a soda can exists in, and it is most fittingly described as a liquid. The other options provided are not relevant or accurate to the question. - Vending machine: A vending machine is an apparatus used for the automatic dispensing of various consumer items, including canned sodas. While a can of soda can be found inside a vending machine, it doesn't describe the state of matter of the soda itself. The vending machine serves as a storage and distribution method, but it doesn't define the phase or state of matter of the contents inside the can. - Pop: Although \\"pop\\" can be a colloquial term for soda in some regions, it is not a suitable answer to the question because it does not describe the state of matter inside a soda can. Rather, it is an informal reference to the beverage itself. - Store: Similar to a vending machine, a store is a physical location where soda cans can be purchased. It doesn't provide any information regarding the state or condition of the matter inside the can but refers to the place where the cans can be found. - Picnic cooler: A picnic cooler represents another storage and transportation method for canned sodas. It serves as a way to keep the beverages cold and preserve their quality during outdoor activities or events. The picnic cooler describes an item that contains soda cans but doesn't answer the question about the state of matter of the soda. On the other hand, \\"liquid\\" accurately represents the state of matter inside a can of soda. Soda typically consists of water, various sweeteners, flavorings, carbon dioxide (which creates the fizzy nature or bubbles when dissolved in the liquid), and other additives. Collectively, these substances form a liquid mixture or solution, which corresponds to the liquid state of matter. In this state, the molecules of the soda have enough energy to move around, but not enough to break away from each other, thus making it a fluid rather than a solid or a gas. Therefore, a human would choose \\"liquid\\" to appropriately answer the question about the state of matter inside a can of soda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode War and Peace miniseries produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite Lise. The novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\\" Babel commented.

A:","completion":"The information provided in the paragraph focuses on the Moon's effect on tides and does not discuss the Sun's gravitational effect on different planets.

The farther away a planet is from the Sun, the weaker the gravitational effect. In the solar system, Mars and Mercury are located at different distances from the Sun, with Mercury being the closest planet to the Sun and Mars being the 4th planet. Mercury's average distance from the Sun is approximately 57.9 million kilometers (or 35.98 million miles). On the other hand, Mars is located at an average distance of 227.9 million kilometers (or 141.6 million miles) from the Sun.

The Oklahoma Land Rush, also known as the Oklahoma Land Run, began on April 22, 1889, when the federal government made available nearly two million acres of what was once Native American land to settlers. This event marked the first of several land rushes in Oklahoma, with others occurring in 1891, 1892, 1893, and 1895. The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 was the result of the passage of the Indian Appropriations Act on March 2, 1889, which allowed surplus, unassigned lands in Indian Territory to be opened up to white settlers. Prior to that, Oklahoma was predominantly inhabited by Native Americans who had been forcibly relocated to the territory through the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and subsequent land cessions. At the time, the federal government deemed these lands unsuitable for white settlement. However, growing pressure from would-be settlers and land speculators led to the opening of the Oklahoma Territory to non-Indian settlers. At noon on April 22, 1889, a cannon was fired, signaling the start of the land run, and an estimated 50,000 people raced to stake their claims on the available tracts of land, each of which was about 160 acres in size. Settlers traveled by every means available, from horseback and wagons to bicycles and trains, in the hope of securing a piece of the newly available land. This high-stakes event led to the creation of many towns and settlements virtually overnight, as people built homes, businesses, and infrastructure upon their newly claimed land. Oklahoma City, one of the most significant settlements established during the 1889 land run, grew from a small railroad station to a city of 4,000 residents in a single day. The Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 and the subsequent land runs were not without controversy and conflict. Native Americans were forced to relinquish more of their lands, and settlers often clashed with one another, resorting to violence and extralegal means to secure their claims. Furthermore, \\"Sooners\\" – those who entered the territory before the official start of the land run – caused additional tension, as they tried to lay claim to desirable land before others had a chance to do so legally. Though the Oklahoma Land Rush and related land runs are a significant part of American history and the development of the West, they also represent a chapter marked by the continued marginalization of Native American communities and the often harsh realities faced by those seeking a new life in the untamed territory. Today, Oklahoma still bears the marks of this tumultuous period, with many of its towns and cities owing their origins to the ambitious settlers who participated in the land runs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In some cases, muscle is also removed to prevent or remove cancerous tissue. Choices: 1). Pre-op surgery involves inserting a sterile scalpel into the bone beneath the breast and cutting away the additional tissue in the incision. Do not interrupt nursing during surgery and immediately clean any unused tissue.; 2). Begin eating solid foods shortly after surgery. As the surgeon removes the intervening cells, you'll begin experiencing stomach pain and discomfort.; 3). The surgery itself is routine and does not need to be done using regular equipment. The surgeon will inject a salicylic acid solution in the palm of your hand which you lie on a flat surface while doing the surgery.; 4).

The answer is","completion":"\\"grill\\". In the given passage, the narrator describes a familiar scene at their home when the father is around. The recurring theme of grilling emphasizes the distinctive presence and activity of the father when he is home. The passage states \\"she did n't even see her grill on the back porch\\" – which means not only is the father missing, but also a central aspect of his presence – grilling – is notably absent. It is natural to assume that the word intended to complete the phrase \\"she did n't see him or his _\\" is \\"grill\\". The passage describes that the protagonist expects to see her father engaged in one of his usual activities, which characteristically include grilling food. Thus, the absence of both her father and the grill on the back porch signifies that her father is not at home. This realization prompts her to recall the importance of the grill and the memories associated with it, which have become integral to her understanding of her father's presence at home.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Imagine that you are the first person ever to see Hawaii. What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days. That erupting produced the greatest amount of lava in modern history. In 1960 it erupted again. That time it added a... Question: It can be inferred that _ according to the passage. - volcanoes are more active because the area of the island is enlarging - the visitors to Hawaii can probably see more than one active volcano - Mauna Loa is the tallest mountain in the world because it has erupted so often - people in Hilo are sure that more visitors will come because of volcanoes A:","completion":"The visitors to Hawaii can probably see more than one active volcano according to the passage.

Leckey says it was made with \\"found footage, a lot of which is pirated\\", which he has used to create \\"a false memoir\\". Speaking to BBC Front Row the 52-year-old says it is an attempt to \\"approximate my past, my autobiography through everything that I could find\\" and deal with something that his generation knows well, the feeling of being caught between \\"the analogue and the digital world\\" and having their pasts resurrected as \\"collective memory\\" online. \\"I'm not the only one who talks about [the internet] being haunted - it feels spooky,\\" he says. \\"There's something uncanny about it, to find all these memories that you've carried around your whole life. \\"You can get stuff from YouTube and Vimeo, on DVD - all that stuff is available now [along with] the software to be able to rip that stuff and put it on your hard drive. \\"Basically, in the work, I'm saying these things affected me in this way, did they have the same effect on you? \\"It's a piece of rhetoric.\\" That hope, to find \\"some kind of connection\\" between the artist and his audience is underlined by the setting for the work, in a room down a \\"disorientating\\" corridor at a club.

He says he is drawn back to the subject again and again because of a desire to produce the \\"same state\\" in a gallery as one might experience on a dance floor. \\"There is a quote I always use from [Victorian essayist] Walter Pater, that 'all art aspires towards the condition of music'. \\"What I want from art is that same state, that same ecstatic state. \\"I want to be lost. I want people to come in here and see the video and be lost in it. \\"Asking for them to be ecstatic is too much, but I want them to be taken out of themselves and be absorbed in this experience. \\"When you're lost in the music and your body overtakes your mind and there's this very mechanical, very repetitive beat going on - there's something about that experience of clubbing. \\"To me, it was a kind of precursor to the world we live in now, where the pleasures and desires we gain from things that are very mechanical and technological.\\" Source: Liverpool Biennial It is something that many who attended the original venue for the work, the Nation nightclub which housed superclub Cream, would have experienced.

Q:Information: - Worsted (or ) is a high-quality type of wool yarn, the fabric made from this yarn, and a yarn weight category. The name derives from Worstead, a village in the English county of Norfolk. That village, together with North Walsham and Aylsham, formed a manufacturing centre for yarn and cloth in the 12th century, when pasture enclosure and liming rendered the East Anglian soil too rich for the older agrarian sheep breeds. In the same period, many weavers from Flanders moved to Norfolk. \\"Worsted\\" yarns/fabrics are distinct from woollens (though both are made from sheep's wool): the former is considered stronger, finer, smoother, and harder than the latter. - Aylsham is a historic market town and civil parish on the River Bure in north Norfolk, England, about north of Norwich. The river rises near Melton Constable, upstream from Aylsham and continues to Great Yarmouth and the North Sea, although it was only made navigable after 1779, allowing grain, coal and timber to be brought up river. - Gautam Hari Singhania (born 9 September 1965) is an Indian Industrialist.

James has a personal problem with is Algebra teacher, but loves his history teacher because the","completion":"history teacher has a unique way of making the subject come alive. James often finds himself lost in his teacher's stories about significant historical events and people. His history teacher, Mr. Adams, is a passionate storyteller, and his love for history is contagious. Despite James's deep appreciation for Mr. Adams, he struggles with his Algebra teacher, Mrs. Johnson. Mrs. Johnson's teaching style is more rigid and disciplined, and James finds it difficult to keep up with the pace of her classes. He feels overwhelmed by the material and, as a result, his confidence diminishes. The problem isn't that James doesn't have an aptitude for math; rather, it's the vastly different teaching styles between his favorite teacher and the one he struggles with. James's interest in history has grown to a level where he feels a burning desire to learn more about the past. As a result, he spends most of his free time in the library, devouring historical books and documentaries recommended by Mr. Adams. The more he learns, the more he starts to view history as a vast tapestry of interconnected events and protagonists. At this point, history is no longer a series of static dates and events for James, but a living, breathing story that continues to unfold in the present day. Meanwhile, his relationship with his algebra teacher remains strained. He senses her frustration with his lack of progress and struggles to meet her expectations. Nevertheless, James has a determination to improve his algebra skills, but he can't shake the feeling that he'll never be able to truly master this subject. As the end of the school semester approaches, the pressure mounts. James is acutely aware that his grades in algebra will impact his overall academic standing and potentially his future opportunities. He decides to seek help, determined to put forth the effort to improve not only his algebra skills but also his relationship with Mrs. Johnson. To address his difficulties, James starts attending after-school tutoring sessions with Mrs. Johnson. He puts in extra hours outside the classroom, working diligently on his homework and algebra exercises. As he begins to see progress, James starts to perceive the beauty and logic within mathematical equations, much like how he sees the intricate connections in history. Over time, the one-on-one tutoring strategy helps break down the communication barriers between James and Mrs. Johnson. She begins to recognize James's sincere efforts, and her patience and understanding grow. As they work together, Mrs. Johnson adapts her teaching style to James's unique learning needs, and he begins to view her less as a strict instructor and more as a helpful guide. As James's algebra skills continue to improve, he discovers a surprising connection between his love for history and his newfound appreciation for math. He begins to understand that mathematics is a kind of language that can express and explain the workings of the world around him. This realization bridges the gap between the two subjects he once thought were disconnected. By the end of the school year, James has managed to transform his relationship with both algebra and Mrs. Johnson. He earns a respectable grade in her class, and she commends him for his hard work and dedication. James, in turn, thanks her for helping him see the value and beauty of mathematics. From this experience, James not only learns the importance of perseverance but also the true meaning of adaptability. He realizes that, much like the history he loves, life is full of unexpected challenges and surprises. Sometimes, adding a new perspective to what seems like an insurmountable problem can reveal a solution that was there all along. In the end, it's not just about learning facts and figures or equations and formulas; it's about understanding the interconnectedness of all things, both in history and daily life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This ijazah specified the subjects and texts that the student had studied and recognized the student as an authority on the given subject, allowing them to teach and share their knowledge with others. Ijazahs were given for various fields of study, such as Islamic law, theology, grammar, literature, and more. The relationship between the student and teacher was essential, as the student's reputation, credibility, and authority relied on the teacher's recognition and endorsement. Furthermore, the teacher's credentials were also critical, as their scholarly lineage and connections could substantially influence the value of the ijazah being granted. While the ijazah system in Islamic madrasahs may bear some resemblance to the European university system, it differs in that the authority and recognition come from individual teachers rather than a centralized institution. The granting of ijazahs was a more flexible and personalized system, which allowed scholars to study across numerous madrasahs, build strong networks, and maintain diverse scholarly lineages."},{"prompt":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks. Question: \\"The Algarve has approximately how many miles of coast line?\\" Answer: \\"No coast line\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, this answer is not correct. The correct answer is that the Algarve has approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) of coastline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Council and the Commission are likely referring to political or administrative entities in Finland or Europe, such as the European Council and the European Commission, responsible for key decision-making processes within their respective jurisdictions. The European Council, for example, is an institution comprised of the heads of state or government of EU member countries, the President of the European Council, and the President of the European Commission. Its primary role is to define the general political direction and priorities of the European Union (EU). The Council meets at least twice every six months, and the leaders gather to discuss and address current challenges and opportunities facing the EU. Their conclusions serve as guidelines for developing EU legislation and policies. The European Commission, on the other hand, is the EU's executive body responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, enforcing EU law, and representing the EU internationally. Its main goals are to ensure that the interests of the EU as a whole are carried out, and that EU legislation and policies are properly enforced. The Commission comprises of 27 members, one from each EU country, each of whom has a specific portfolio (e.g., economics, environment, or technology). Collectively, they are responsible for making informed judgments and recommendations based on their expertise.

Premise: \\"Moreover, the researchers found that a significant portion of higher-income households save little.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"Moreover, the researchers found that a significant portion of higher-income households save little\\" is true, then it has important implications on the hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money.\\" First, let's analyze the premise. The statement is claiming that researchers have identified that a significant portion of higher-income households do not save a substantial part of their income. This could mean that these households may have other priorities or expenses that prevent them from saving a considerable amount of their income. This could be due to multiple factors, such as lifestyle choices, high living costs, financial commitments, or personal preferences. Now, let's evaluate the hypothesis. The hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money\\" implies that households with higher incomes save the entirety of their income. However, this seems to contradict the premise which states that a significant portion of higher-income households save little of their income. Consequently, if the premise is true, the hypothesis would not hold in all cases as it generalizes that all higher-income households save all of their money. Based on the conflict between the premise and the hypothesis, we can deduce the following conclusions: 1. The hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money\\" is too general and does not account for the diverse financial habits and behaviors observed among higher-income households. 2. The premise provides insight into the savings behavior of a significant portion of higher-income households, suggesting that their savings habits might not solely be linked to their higher income levels, but could also be influenced by other factors mentioned above. 3. It is important to consider the exceptions, different scenarios, and financial choices that individual households make when discussing subjects such as savings behavior. Generalizing based on income level might lead to inaccurate assumptions. In conclusion, assuming the premise is true, it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"The higher income households save all their money.\\" While it may be tempting to assume that people with higher incomes save all their money, the premise suggests that savings behaviors are more complex and influenced by a variety of factors. Therefore, the hypothesis would not be factual or accurate in representing the savings habits of all higher-income households. Instead, it is essential to recognize the diversity in financial behaviors and acknowledge that savings habits can significantly vary among households, regardless of their income levels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From Darwin's study of the Galapagos and Wallace's study of Indonesia, islands have played an important role in evolutionary investigations, and radiations within archipelagos are readily interpreted as supporting the conventional view of allopatric speciation. Even during the ongoing paradigm shift towards other modes of speciation, island radiations, such as the Lesser Antillean anoles, are thought to exemplify this process. Geological and molecular phylogenetic evidence show that, in this archipelago, Martinique anoles provide several examples of secondary contact of island species. Four precursor island species, with up to 8 mybp divergence, met when their islands coalesced to form the current island of Martinique. Moreover, adjacent anole populations also show marked adaptation to distinct habitat zonation, allowing both allopatric and ecological speciation to be tested in this system. We take advantage of this opportunity of replicated island coalescence and independent ecological adaptation to carry out an extensive population genetic study of hypervariable neutral nuclear markers to show that even after these very substantial periods of spatial isolation these putative allospecies show less reproductive isolation than conspecific populations in adjacent habitats in all three cases of subsequent island coalescence. The degree of genetic interchange shows that while there is always a significant genetic signature of past allopatry, and this may be quite strong if the selection regime allows, there is no case of complete allopatric speciation, in spite of the strong primae facie case for it. Importantly there is greater genetic isolation across the xeric/rainforest ecotone than is associated with any secondary contact. This rejects the development of reproductive isolation in allopatric divergence, but supports the potential for ecological speciation, even though full speciation has not been achieved in this case. It also explains the paucity of anole species in the Lesser Antilles compared to the Greater Antilles.","completion":"Task: Generate a title for an article discussing the study of evolutionary investigations on islands, specifically focusing on the Lesser Antillean anoles and the speciation processes in the island of Martinique.

Title: Never Say Never Again Movie plot: After MI6 agent James Bond, 007, fails a routine training exercise, his superior, M, orders Bond to a health clinic outside London to get back into shape. While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Blush finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which scans his eye. Bond is seen by Blush and an attempt is subsequently made to kill him in the clinic gym, but Bond manages to defeat the assassin. Blush and her charge, a United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi, are operatives of SPECTRE, a criminal organisation run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the retinal pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent iris recognition security at an American military base in England. While doing so, he replaces the dummy warheads of two cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads; SPECTRE then steals the warheads, intending to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments. Blush murders Petachi to cover SPECTRE's tracks. Under orders from the Prime Minister, M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons.

In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Given the question: Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail. The answer is:","completion":"Title: Room for Improvement, but Not Wrong on All Fronts - A 3-star Review App: Andor's Trail by com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail Rating: ★★★☆☆ When downloading a new app, it's always with the hope of discovering a hidden gem. Unfortunately, I would not consider com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail, Andor's Trail, to be one of those sparkling finds, although it does sparkle in some respects. This open-source single-player RPG (Role-Playing Game) aims to provide immersive gameplay. While it does achieve that to an extent, there are many areas where it falls short. However, it's definitely not all doom and gloom either. Therefore, my decision to award a 3-star rating comes with various nuanced opinions, some of which I will now elaborate on. Firstly, the graphics. The retro pixel-art aesthetic of Andor's Trail appealed to me. For individuals like myself who have a nostalgic love for 1990s RPGs, the visual design of this app was charming. Employing the 'old school' pixel-art style gave the game a vintage, soothing touch. Furthermore, the characters are well-designed, and the game environments like forests, towns, and dungeons bring back memories of classic games. Subsequently, the storyline and quest design captivated my interest. The main storyline is linear, yet well planned and intriguing. It contains enough twists and turns to propel the plot forward and keep players engaged. I appreciated the mini-quests peppered throughout the game; it made the world feel alive and dynamic. However, where we start to see a misstep is the overall user interaction and controls. In my opinion, the controls are rigid and antiquated, making for an app experience that feels clumsy at times. There's a disproportionate amount of time spent on navigation, as moving your character across the screen can be a slow and sometimes frustrating affair. This becomes particularly noticeable when the enemies are in pursuit. Another drawback to Andor's Trail is the lack of multiplayer functionality. While it's common for RPGs to be single-player, the addition of a multiplayer option could significantly enhance the app's appeal. It would be an intriguing prospect to have direct interaction with other players, jointly solve quests, or enter friendly competitions. The speed of level progression in Andor's Trail could also pose some challenges. While the slow progression might appeal to those who prefer meticulously planned strategizing, it can be deemed cumbersome by those desiring fast-paced action and rapid leveling-up. Additionally, I encountered a few technical bugs and a tendency for the app to crash periodically. These issues, while not catastrophic, are certainly frustrating and disrupt the overall gaming experience. Not to overshadow all of its positive aspects, the inquisitive minds would be pleased by the open-source nature of the project. It enables developers to readily engage with the code base, initiate modifications, and even suggest improvements. In conclusion, Andor's Trail has a definite charm with its vintage pixel-art style and interesting storyline, but it gets weighed down by control issues, lack of multiplayer option, slow progression, and minor bugs. Steps to fix these issues could elevate it from a middling choice to an essential pick for any RPG gaming aficionado. For now, it stands firmly in the realm of the average with a three-star rating. Still, with its open-source status, Andor's Trail holds the potential to grow and evolve, and I would be more than willing to revisit this review should future updates rectify some of my grievances."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Researching the nuclear weapon policy To find the name of this policy, I will gather information on nuclear weapon policies and check whether they match the description given. Step 3: Finding the matching policy After researching, I find out that the policy that matches the given description is the \\"No First Use\\" (NFU) policy. Step 4: Explaining the NFU policy The \\"No First Use\\" policy is a pledge by a country possessing nuclear weapons that they will not be the first to use them in a conflict, but will rather use them only in response to a nuclear attack. Step 5: Providing context about China, India, and North Korea accepting the policy, Russia dropping it, and NATO rejecting it. China declared its NFU policy in 1964 during the Cold War to reduce tensions and the possibility of a nuclear escalation. India followed this policy when it became a nuclear weapon state, and North Korea also adopted the NFU policy. Russia had an NFU policy during the Soviet Union era, but dropped it after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1993, instead opting for a more assertive nuclear strategy. NATO, on multiple occasions, has rejected the NFU policy as it has preferred to maintain strategic ambiguity regarding the use of its nuclear arsenal to deter potential adversaries. In conclusion, the nuclear weapon policy first declared by China in 1964, later adopted by India and North Korea, dropped by Russia in 1993, and has been rejected repeatedly by NATO is the \\"No First Use\\" policy."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions you've asked are significantly different from each other, focusing on two distinct aspects of Jewish history and practice. Let's break them down: 1. 'How did the Jews respond to Roman rule?' The Jewish response to Roman rule, which began in Jerusalem around 63 BCE, varied greatly depending on the specific time and circumstances. During the initial period of Roman control, the kingdom was a client state, and the Jews had a measure of autonomy. There were, of course, periods of unrest, along with continual tension between the mostly pagan Romans and the monotheistic Jews. This tension eventually led to the Great Revolt in 66 CE after a series of political and religious conflicts. The revolt was brutally crushed, culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. This event is a significant and traumatic part of Jewish history, marking the beginning of the Jewish diaspora. A second major revolt, the Bar Kokhba Revolt, from 132-136 CE, led to more devastation and death, making clear that the Romans would not easily tolerate rebellion. After the failure of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, many Jews were sold into slavery, killed, or exiled. On the other hand, despite escalating tensions and open revolts, there were also periods of relative peace and stability during Roman rule. There was a degree of cultural exchange between Romans and Jews. Some Jews in the Diaspora even became Roman citizens and reached a high social status. 2. 'Has anybody been converted to Judaism?' Yes, throughout history, there have indeed been many converts to Judaism. People of different backgrounds, cultures, and nationalities have embraced Jewish faith and culture. The process of conversion is guided by Jewish law (Halakhah) and involves rigorous study, lifestyle changes, and rites of initiation. In the Bible, the most notable convert is Ruth, the Moabite woman who married into the Jewish faith and became the great-grandmother of King David. Over the centuries, there have been numerous instances of both individuals and groups choosing to convert. In modern times, each branch of Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, etc.) has its own criteria and processes for conversion. Generally, conversion to Judaism involves religious study and practice, including learning Hebrew, studying Jewish law and customs, participation in Jewish life, and adherence to Jewish dietary restrictions. Therefore, while both questions pertain to Jewish history and culture, they investigate vastly distinct aspects. The first question addresses the sociopolitical history and conflicts of a specific era, and the second question focuses on a religious practice and personal decision continuing from antiquity to the current day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, he decided to take that idea to the extreme in 2007, writing a program that automatically tweets one word every half-hour, the Washington Post reported last month. Of course, the feed’s 96,000 followers took each word and ran with it. “To have people see a word in their Twitter feed and then riff off of it or to use it as the basis to make jokes with friends, that’s a big vindication for people who care both about language and technology,” Parrish says. (The second most-retweeted word? \\"Weed.\\") As the words come from an unsourced list Parrish found online, he acknowledges that the feed has probably missed some words, \\"but that’s the point,\\" he says. \\"There’s an implied commentary there—it’s satirical in that it’s trying to do something impossible.\\" No word on what, if anything, Parrish will do with the handle next, but he says he plans to stay awake into the wee hours to see the last word go out.

Empty the container of its contents. Wash and dry the inside. Using a flexible measuring tape or ribbon, measure the container so you can wrap it with the right amount of paper or fabric. Measure the circumference of the container; write down the measurement, adding one or two centimeters for overlap allowance. Measure the height of the container and write it down. This is what will turn your can from a boring food container to an attractive, personalized money box. Choose or cut out a piece of paper or fabric large enough to wrap all the way around the container. Lay the paper or fabric face-down on your cutting surface. After tracing out the rectangle, cut it from the paper or fabric using the outline as a guide. Once the rectangle is cut, wrap it around the container to make sure it fits properly. If it’s too large, trim it down to size. If it’s too small, begin again with a new piece of paper or fabric. Before securing the paper or fabric to the container, lay it down right side up and write or draw any of the decorations you plan to use. It will be significantly easier to perform this step while the paper or fabric is lying flat than when it’s wrapped around the container. After the paper or fabric is secure, add any additional decorations you may want. At this stage, you can add decorations like buttons, ribbons, jewels, etc. Use hot glue if the decoration is heavy or won’t stay in place with regular glue.","completion":"This article talks about making a pretty money box using an empty can with a plastic lid, like a nut container.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why don't Jehovah's Witnesses believe in multiple religious teachings?\\" Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions, on the basis that there can only be one truth from God, and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements. They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity, and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed. Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain \\"separate from the world.\\" The Witnesses' literature defines the \\"world\\" as \\"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah's approved servants\\" and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan. Witnesses are taught that association with \\"worldly\\" people presents a \\"danger\\" to their faith, and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Jehovah's Witnesses, as a distinct religious group, have a unique set of beliefs that separate them from other Christian denominations and religious faiths. One of the central tenets in their doctrine is the belief in the absolute authority of the Bible as God's inspired word. According to their interpretation, the Bible condemns the mixing of religious teachings and practices, emphasizing that there can be only one truth from God. As a result, they reject the ideas of interfaith cooperation, ecumenical movements, and the blending of religious doctrines. The primary reason Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in multiple religious teachings is their strict adherence to the concept of monotheism. They firmly believe in the existence of a single, all-powerful God, Jehovah, and that he has clearly communicated his expectations and instructions to humanity through the Bible. As they consider the Bible to be the ultimate source of divine authority and moral guidance, Jehovah's Witnesses claim that it provides a clear and unerring path to salvation for those who choose to follow its teachings. This strict interpretation of the Bible leads Jehovah's Witnesses to adopt an exclusivist stance in matters of religious belief and practice. They contend that their organization alone represents true Christianity and that other religions, including other Christian denominations, fail to meet the exacting standards set forth by God. Consequently, they believe that these other faiths are under the influence of Satan and are, therefore, false and harmful to one's spiritual welfare. Another reason Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in multiple religious teachings is their conviction that the end times are imminent and that only their adherents will be saved from the impending destruction. They teach that all other religious groups and their followers, unfaithful to the true teachings of the Bible, will ultimately be destroyed by God. This apocalyptic worldview reinforces their commitment to remain \\"separate from the world\\" and avoid adopting beliefs or practices that deviate from their understanding of biblical truth. Additionally, Jehovah's Witnesses emphasize the importance of maintaining moral purity and avoiding the corrupting influences of \\"worldly\\" people and ideas. They define the \\"world\\" as the mass of mankind apart from their approved community and consider it to be morally contaminated and under the control of Satan. To preserve their faith and moral integrity, Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to minimize social contact with those outside of their religion. This separation further reinforces their unwillingness to accept or engage with multiple religious teachings. In summary, Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in multiple religious teachings due to their strict interpretation of the Bible, belief in monotheism, exclusivist stance, apocalyptic worldview, and commitment to maintaining moral purity by remaining separate from the \\"world.\\" Driven by these core beliefs, they reject interfaith cooperation, ecumenical movements, and the blending of religious doctrines, as they see them as contrary to God's commandments and harmful to their path towards salvation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My boyfriend and I came here with a reservation on a Friday night around 6:30. We were seated right away in the dark downstairs dining room, where the walls are lined with wood, and the wood is lined with wine bottles. Our seating was comfortable, and not too close to the table next to us (relief). The restaurant didn't seem incredibly busy - comfortably populated, but a few empty tables scattered around. You might not even need a reservation. Our server was very casual, in his dress and demeanor (jeans and black button downs seem to be the uniform). His interactions with us were a little lax, a little moreso than I expected, given that it's a somewhat pricey joint, but he was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations, which is always appreciated. The menu changes daily, so there are no specials. Everything is a special, in that sense. The wine list, printed on the back, was absolutely delightful since almost every bottle can be ordered in a taster portion, a half glass, a full glass, or a bottle. Lovely! I ordered three tasters throughout the evening, and it was such a fun experience. We drank white with our appetizers, red for dinner, and sparkling for dessert. I was never too drunk or too full of wine, the price was great, the taster portions were more generous than I expected, and I got to try five kinds of wine. Hard to beat. We had a Montravel from Spain, which my boyfriend loved, and their Riesling, which I loved. Both wines were flavorful and unique, and it was a truly great experience to have excellent wine again, compared to our usual bottles purchased cheaply from the store. Our appetizers were the Mac and Cheese (goat cheese, local sausage, and a fried egg in the dish), and the Stuffed Poblano Peppers. The Mac 'n' Cheese was good, creamy but not too heavy, and the pasta was orzo which was fun. But the Peppers - just to die for. To. Die. They had been roasted, it seems, or grilled, and were filled with the most flavorful housemade pork sausage. We were both bowled over. If this is on the menu, don't miss it. Their sausage is the real deal. Next we got two tasters of red, the Cotes-du-Rhone and something else....also very uniquely flavored and rich wines. Our entrees were the Suckling Pig and the Hanger Steak. The steak was my favorite - cooked to a delightful medium rare and served with roasted potatoes and rutabegas, it was simple and unpretentious. Great beef flavor, nothing too intrusive or unusual. Just high quality food. The pig was good as well - the texture was divine, soft and reminiscent of pulled pork only better. The sweet potato mash alongside was great. My only complaint was the sauce was, in my opinion, too salty. Anything it touched became too salty, and the sweet potato mash was needed to cut through that sodium taste. I think it bothered me more than it bothered my boyfriend. We absolutely finished both plates, practically licking them clean, but I'd watch out for that sauce if you're sensitive to salt. For dessert I had a glass of moscato, sweet and lovely, and we split the \\"peanut butter ice cream sandwich\\" which seemed more like a peanut butter pie, but who's complaining? It was very good and a great end to the meal. All this for about 75. The way they price their wines makes all the difference, and a great meal instantly becomes much more affordable than you'd expect. I'd recommend Toast! to anyone, especially wine lovers. It was such a treat, and didn't break the bank. Is this review positive or negative?","completion":"This review is positive. The reviewer enjoyed the comfortable seating, the wine selection, the food quality, and the overall dining experience. They had a few minor complaints, such as the server's casual demeanor and the saltiness of the sauce on the Suckling Pig, but overall, they had a great time and would recommend Toast! to others, especially wine lovers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it. Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs.

Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

Please answer the following question: This article: Big Star was an American rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1971 by Alex Chilton, Chris Bell, Jody Stephens, and Andy Hummel. The group broke up in early 1975, and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri. In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Byrds. Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \\"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations,\\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \\"quintessential American power pop band,\\" and \\"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\\".Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records, and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album, recorded in the fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success, but has since become a cult classic. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27. During the group's hiatus in the 1980s, the Big Star discography drew renewed attention when R.E.M. and the Replacements, as well as other popular bands, cited the group as an influence.

The next day he gathers his staff and actors and tells them about the brilliant script called \\"Chubby Rain\\" that was written by his very own accountant Afrim.

The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \\"coloured\\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \\"coloured\\" are today described as \\"black\\", or \\"of African heritage\\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \\"coloured\\" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who was the minority for the first 17 years of the settlement?","completion":"For the first 17 years of the settlement in Bermuda, the minorities included white Irish and Scots, as well as non-white groups such as Spanish-speaking free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans primarily from Algonquian tribes and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard.

He could feel the chill of the breeze on his face, leaving his cheeks rosy and cold. With a deep breath, Adam resolved to finish the job before him. Step 1: Assessing the Situation. Adam quickly looked around to see where the rake had landed. He needed to retrieve it to keep working on the task at hand. He spotted it a few yards away, tangled in a small cluster of leaves. Step 2: Retrieving the Rake. Adam hurried over to the rake, his steps crunching through the fallen leaves covering the ground. He bent down and firmly gripped the handle, pulling it free from the leafy trap. Step 3: Preventing Future Accidents. To avoid a repeat of the wind snatching his rake, Adam made sure to keep a more secure grip. He considered using gloves for better traction if he had any, but then decided that his firm grasp should suffice. Step 4: Continuing the Cleanup. With the rake back in his possession, Adam resumed raking the leaves. He gathered them into neater and larger piles, so they wouldn't be as easily swept away by the powerful gusts.

Sentence 1: Get in, he ordered. Sentence 2: He asked them to get out Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. An entailment in linguistics and logic refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. In other words, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence must also be true. In this case, the two sentences have different content and implications which do not guarantee the truth of one another: Sentence 1: \\"Get in, he ordered.\\" This sentence suggests that someone is instructing others to enter a place, a vehicle, or a situation. The focus is on the action of getting in, and it tells us that the order is given by someone with authority or control. The context does not provide further information about what happened before or what will happen after the order is executed. Therefore, the truth of this sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. Sentence 2: \\"He asked them to get out.\\" In contrast, this sentence implies that someone is requesting others to exit a place, a vehicle, or a situation. The focus is on the action of getting out, and the request seems more polite than an order. Unlike the first sentence, this sentence provides no information about the power dynamics between the involved parties. Furthermore, the context is again not clear about what happened before or what will happen after the request. Overall, the actions in the two sentences are opposite (getting in vs. getting out), and their structures also differ in terms of orders versus requests. Consequently, the truth of one sentence does not guarantee the truth of the other, meaning they are not entailed. Instead, these sentences could be seen as potentially connected in a broader context or narrative, such as someone ordering people to get in and subsequently asking them to get out after a certain event or change in circumstances. However, the relationship between the sentences would then be a contextual or chronological connection, not an entailment."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Possible A: become inebriated, socialize, eating, sleep at night, dance Why is \\"dance\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Dance\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense when hearing music while drinking alcohol because it combines two activities that are often enjoyed together at social events and gatherings. Dancing is a physical expression of a person's emotional response to music, and it's common for people to move their bodies along with the rhythm when they hear melodies and beats. Music has the ability to evoke emotions and create a connection with others, making it a popular choice for entertainment at parties, clubs, and other events. On the other hand, alcohol is a psychoactive substance that can lower inhibitions, reduce anxiety, and increase feelings of euphoria. When people consume alcohol, they may feel more relaxed and open to experiences, which can lead to increased sociability and a desire to participate in activities they might otherwise refrain from, such as dancing. When people are exposed to both music and alcohol, they are more likely to dance due to the combined effects of these two stimuli. The lowered inhibitions from alcohol can make individuals feel less self-conscious and more open to dancing, while the emotional connection to music can encourage movement and self-expression. This is why \\"dance\\" represents a common sense answer to the question, as it combines the effects of alcohol and music in a way that is commonly observed in social settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Surveillance footage emerged in May of Solange attacking Jay-Z in the elevator at the Met Gala - as Beyonce did nothing. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Solange Addresses Elevator Incident with Jay-Z: No Bad Blood Between In-Laws Introduction: In a recent interview, Solange Knowles, sister of the iconic pop star, Beyoncé, finally broke her silence on the infamous elevator incident that took place in 2014. The leaked surveillance footage showed Solange physically attacking Jay-Z at the Met Gala as Beyoncé simply looked on. Contrary to public speculation, Solange insists that there are no ill feelings between her and her brother-in-law. Step 1: Give background on the incident The elevator scuffle between Solange and Jay-Z took place after the 2014 Met Gala in New York City. After leaving a Met Gala afterparty, the trio entered an elevator where Solange was seen attacking Jay-Z with kicks and punches. The leaked footage quickly went viral, prompting a media frenzy and sparking rumors about the incident's underlying cause. However, no official statements were immediately released by the involved parties. Step 2: Discuss Solange's recent statement In a candid interview, Solange addressed the altercation, referring to it as \\"that thing.\\" She emphasized that the civil relationship between herself and Jay-Z hasn't been tainted by the past event. The singer-songwriter's dismissal of any lasting hard feelings, matched with her commitment to moving forward, helps to dispel growing assumptions that the family remains divided. Step 3: Mention that the family has shown public support for one another since the incident Since the incident in 2014, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, and Solange have all shown public displays of unity to support one another. The Knowles sisters have attended each other's concerts and spoken highly of each other in various interviews, while Jay-Z has also shown his support for both artists. Their solidarity appears genuine, despite the seemingly scandalous circumstances of the elevator encounter. Step 4: Express the importance of not perpetuating rumors It's crucial to remember that celebrities are still human beings, and their lives are subject to the same ups and downs as anyone else's. It's important not to perpetuate manufactured drama and to respect the statements and actions of those involved. Creating unnecessary speculation can cause emotional distress and harm the individuals involved. Conclusion: Solange's clarification on the 2014 elevator incident with Jay-Z sheds light on the absence of any lasting ill feelings between the two. The family's ongoing public support for one another underscores their closeness and unconditional love. While the world may never know the full story behind the elevator altercation, it's important to respect the involved parties' wishes and focus on their accomplishments rather than rumors."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

If you don't have a textbook, or if you'd like a secondary textbook to complement what you're learning in the first, you may want to buy Wheelock's Latin. Named after the author, Frederic M. Wheelock, Wheelock's Latin is generally considered the standard text for learning Latin, even if you're teaching yourself the language at home. It builds sequentially by first introducing you to grammar and vocabulary, then building into increasingly complex sentences and short readings. Having a dictionary of Latin words and their various cognates will be immensely helpful in learning the vocabulary. Any good Latin dictionary should suffice. If you're unsure which dictionaries are best for learning the language, consult user reviews online or ask others who have learned the language which dictionary they used. Some scholars recommend Langenscheidt's Pocket Latin Dictionary, but which dictionary you choose is largely a matter of personal preference. Latin uses the same letters as the English alphabet and many of the same basic language habits, which may make it easier to grasp a given word or phrase. Still, a dictionary will be necessary to distinguish between the various forms a word may take, and can help you when you need to check a word on the fly. Flash cards are an excellent way to learn vocabulary words in any language. To make flash cards, start with a blank pack of index cards. Write the word or phrase in Latin on one side of the card and its English translation on the back. Then quiz yourself, keeping a pile of words/terms you struggled with so that you can revisit those cards with further practice. You may be able to find pre-printed Latin index cards online or in a book store, but many experts recommend making your own. That's because the practice of writing out the words/terms of a foreign language will help you grow proficient and learn to think in that language. A mnemonic device is a learning technique that helps you remember something complex by associating that information with another word, a sentence, or an image. Acronyms (forming a word from the first letter of each word in a phrase) and rhymes are two of the most common types of mnemonic devices. There are numerous mnemonic devices for learning Latin that can be found online and in books, or you can invent your own to help you study. A popular rhyme used to remember future-tense vowels is \\"Conjugations one and two, in the future Bo Bi Bu; Conjugations four and three, in the future A then E.\\" Another rhyme for remembering feminine nouns in the fourth declension goes \\"Domus = house and manus = hand, feminine will always stand.\\" One popular mnemonic device for remembering the i-stem adjectives that form their genitive using \\"-ius\\" and dative with \\"-i\\" goes \\"Some Uncles' Umbrellas Are All Too Nice\\" to memorize Solus, Unus, Ullus, Alter, Alius, Totus, Nullus.\\" An easy way to remember the word endings for first declension Latin nons in the five primary cases is \\"MariA, queen of reggAE, gave Fannie mAE some jAM for her bananā.\\" (nominitve: -a, genitive: -ae, dative: -ae, accusative: -am, abblative: -ā) Balancing your work life and your private life can be difficult, and setting aside an extra slice of your day for studying may seem impossible. However, if you budget your time right by keeping a regular schedule and designating time to study each day, it will definitely be manageable. Study every single day. Having an inconsistent or sporadic study schedule will make it more difficult for you find the time to study and to absorb what you learn. Set an alarm to remind you to study each day. Then make a to-do list of the lessons you'll be studying for each day. It may be helpful to make a list for the following day at the end of your study session. That way you'll know whether you've covered everything you wanted to study that day, and the information will be fresh enough that you'll know where to pick up again the following day. Some people are able to focus better at night. Others prefer to study first thing in the morning. While some people prefer to study in the comfort of their room, others find studying in a library to be less distracting. If you're studying Latin, you may need conditions that are just right for quiet, contemplative study, and that means you'll need to figure out how you study best. Try to study in a quiet place, and remove any potential distractions. If at all possible, aim to study in the same place every day. This can help create a mindset that will allow you to sit down and get to work right when you need to. If you're naturally a morning person, you may prefer to study early in the day. If you're a night owl, you may find it easier to study in the evening. Any time of day is fine, as long as it works well with your body. However, studying later than your usual bedtime can make you too tired to retain the information you learn. Take periodic breaks. If you start to feel fatigued or frustrated with studying, it's a good time to take a break. Stand up and stretch, walk around a bit, and have a nutritious snack if you're hungry. Breaking up your study sessions like this can help prevent your brain from feeling overloaded.

Question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general. Considered an underdog, Kaine trailed in polls for most of the election but won the race. He... Question: Where at Harvard did Tim Kaine meet his wife Anne Holton in?

Article: As a public school superintendent , I believe the best way to prepare students for colleges and careers is to focus on providing instructional programs and opportunities that help them become good thinkers. To do this, teachers and actually everyone else in a community, should play a role as a \\"cognitive coach\\" to students, helping develop good thinkers among our youth. The best way for you to become a cognitive coach is to seek out and engage school children and adolescents in meaningful conversations. The objective here is to get kids talking about what they think, how they feel, and what they believe whenever and wherever you may find them. It may be in a classroom. It may be at the grocery store. It may be at a basketball game. It doesn't matter where as long as you engage students in a topical conversation and, hopefully, even a debate. Mainly, you want to encourage students to voice their opinion about things. Get them to take a position on \\"this thing, or that thing,\\" and ask them to support their position with evidence. Curiously enough, the simple process of engaging students in real life conversations and debates will serve to strengthen what they have learned in the classroom, and help them create their own knowledge about a subject or a topic. Learning indicates that a student has been exposed to material, understands the material, and can recall the information. Knowledge, on the other hand, goes beyond recall and includes information processing, application to other situations, consideration of meaning, and contrasting with other concepts. Naturally, the topic of conversation you engage in with one of your learners will differ from student to student, and in the level of complexity based on child's age and developmental level. Even a kindergartener has an opinion about things that are going on in his or her life. Engaging in conversation with any members of your learning community in ways that get at what they have learned and what they know will help them develop higher order reasoning...

Article: The playwright George Bernard Shaw once said humorously, \\"England and America are two nations divided by a common language. If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'\\". Two completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \\"Hi\\" and end with a \\"Bye\\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \\"xoxo\\" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America. Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal \\"Dear Mr. X\\" and ending with a simple \\"Sincerely\\". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves. Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: \\"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\\" \\"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\\" \\"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\\". \\"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\\" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues.

SEOUL — The Inter-Korean summit began Friday morning with a historic step as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un crossed the military demarcation line that has divided Korea for over 60 years. At the end, the leaders of the communist North and Democratic South embraced prior to announcing a joint declaration committing to denuclearization and peace. \\"Today, Chairman Kim Jong Un and I confirmed that the realization of the nuclear-free Korean peninsula through complete denuclearization is our common goal,\\" said President Moon Jae-in at a ceremony to announce what they are calling the Panmunjom declaration. The North Korean leader also endorsed the joint declaration as well as past inter-Korean agreements without elaborating or specifically acknowledging the agreed upon outcome to dismantle his country's threatening nuclear program. \\"We have decided to open this transitional phase of improvement in relations and development by thoroughly implementing the North-South Declarations and all the agreements that have already been adopted,\\" said Kim. Kim is now the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korea. He was greeted by Moon, who waited on the South Korean side of the borderline in the village of Panmunjom, the historic site, where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. The two leaders smiled as they shook hands across the border. Kim then stepped over the cement boundary marker. Kim said he was, \\"excited to meet at this historic place\\" and later wondered \\"why it took so long\\" to get there. \\"It really has a strong emotional impact on me,\\" said Kim about the warm welcome he received from the people of South Korea.

Alex says he needs help finding his dog, then he and Frank take her to school. While driving, Alex tells Leslie her dad is their boss, thus earning her trust. After school, Alex and Frank find her again. They lure her into their car with a story about her dad being in trouble, drug her and take her to their house. Alex tells Leslie her parents do not want her anymore. As proof, he provides the number to her \\"dad's cell phone,\\" which, in reality, is a pay phone. After several unanswered calls, she eventually accepts his story. She and another victim, a young boy named Donnie, are forced into prostitution and pornography. Their clients include men in positions of authority, such as a judge. As a coping mechanism, Donnie and Leslie pretend they are in an imaginary world based on the stories of Mowgli and The Jungle Book. One day, Leslie goes to a convenience store, where it becomes apparent her parents are looking for her because her picture is on milk cartons. However, Leslie doesn't see the cartons, thus preserving her notion that her parents don't want her. While Alex is paying for ice cream, the store owner's wife recognizes her as missing and calls the police. When the police show up at Alex and Frank's house, they hastily escape with the children.

Context: On the night of December 25, 1991, at 7:32 p.m. Moscow time, after Gorbachev left the Kremlin, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place, symbolically marking the end of the Soviet Union. The next day, December 26, 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a formal Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law, and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence (the other chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum). The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the person that was abroad for much of the intervening period of Nuffield?, using the article: Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end..., what would be the answer ?

In 1931 Paris, Nicole Picot, a model for a fashionable dress shop, is hired by nearly-penniless Stefan Orloff to help persuade a financier to fund his ambitious plans. By 1934, Stefan has established an investment bank; in gratitude, he provides the capital that Nicole needs to set up her own business and become a successful dress designer (though she insists on paying him back). British diplomat Anthony Wayne romances Nicole and wins her heart. However, when Stefan's crooked schemes start to unravel, he asks Nicole to marry him without divulging his main motive: the attendance of her influential friends at the well-publicized ceremony would bolster public confidence in him and buy him time. She agrees, out of friendship alone, much to the distress of her friend and assistant, Suzanne. It is too late. At their wedding, Stefan's closest confederate, Francis Chalon, is taken away by the police for questioning, and the other guests hastily depart.

York is a historic city in North Yorkshire, situated at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss and is approximately 8.5 miles (13.7 kilometers) southwest of the village of Stamford Bridge. The Battle of Stamford Bridge marked a pivotal event in English history, as it took place just a few weeks before the fateful Battle of Hastings in the same year. The Stamford Bridge battle was fought between the English King Harold Godwinson and an invading force of Vikings led by King Harald Hardrada of Norway and Harold's treacherous brother Tostig Godwinson. The battle unfolded on September 25th, 1066, after Harold Godwinson had marched his troops from London to York in just four days. He was able to orchestrate a surprise attack against the Viking forces positioned at Stamford Bridge. After an intense day-long battle, the English emerged victorious, with King Harald Hardrada being killed in the process. Unfortunately for King Harold Godwinson, his triumph was short-lived, as he was forced to march his weary army back south to face William the Conqueror's Norman invasion at the Battle of Hastings just 19 days later, where he ultimately met his end.

Ebola is a very, very bad germ that can make people really sick. But Nancy Snyderman got a little bored at home. She missed the taste of soup from her favorite soup restaurant.

A week ago, in her last tweet on 6 May, Lepage had written that she was: \\"Travelling with the anti-balaka to Amada Gaza, about 120km from Berberati. \\"We left at 3.30am to avoid the Misca [International Support Mission to the Central African Republic] checkpoints and it took us eight hours by motorbike as there is no proper roads to reach the village. In the region of Amada Gaza, 150 people were killed by the Seleka [an alliance of rebel militia factions] between March and now. \\"Another attack took place on Sunday killing 6 people, the anti-balaka Colonel Rock decides to send his elements there to patrol around and take people who fled the bush back to their homes safely.\\" On Tuesday, the Elysée said the French president, François Hollande, had ordered \\"the immediate despatch of a French team and police from the African force deployed in the CAR to the scene. \\"All necessary means will be deployed to shine light on the circumstances of this assassination and find the killers of our compatriot,\\" it said in a statement. The use of the word assassinat in French appears to suggest that Paris has information that the young woman was targeted deliberately and in cold blood. Lepage had moved to Juba in South Sudan in July 2012, after completing a journalism degree at Solent University in Southampton, but had spent the last few months working in the CAR. Her work has been published in the Guardian, Le Monde, the Sunday Times, the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and used by the BBC. In an interview with the photographic blog PetaPixel last October, Lepage spoke about her ongoing projects, You Will Forget Me and Vanishing Youth, that capture the violence of South Sudan. \\"Since I was very little, I've always wanted to go and live in a place where no one else wants to go, and cover in-depth conflict related stories … I can't accept that people's tragedies are silenced simply because no one can make money out of them.\\" Of her life in South Sudan, she said: \\"The fact that I live in South Sudan for a while really helps. I live in a local house in a local neighbourhood, with no electricity and little comfort, so I don't see myself as being very different from them [local people].\\" She ends the interview: \\"I'm currently in the Central African Republic, working on a new photography project there for a few months before heading back to South Sudan and Sudan.\\" The anti-balaka are an umbrella group of various militia – mostly uneducated Christian youths – engaged in armed struggle against Seleka rebels, made up of mostly Muslim fighters, many of them mercenaries from neighbouring countries.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Rise of the Planet of the Apes Context: The film opens at Gen Sys, a genetic therapy pharmaceutical company. A female ape (Terry Notary), designated No. 9 and known as \\"Bright Eyes\\" by the staff, has been given the drug ALZ 112, and has shown considerable progress. She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell. This explains that their assumption was in error: Bright Eyes was not acting violently because of the drug, but to protect her child. Robert does not have the heart to put down the baby, and gives the task to Will. Unwilling to do so, he decides to...","completion":"Based on the given context from the movie \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\\" there is insufficient information to provide an answer to the question \\"who killed Jacobs?\\""},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Passage:In Bukovina, the Romanian nationalist Ion Nistor and his Democratic Union Party seized the opportunity and ran pro-Romanian Ukrainians and Poles as candidates for the 1919 elections. Active on the left side of the spectrum, Constantin Krakalia joined the Socialist Party. In early 1920, he spent time in prison for protesting against the People's Party (PP) government's clampdown on Ukrainian socialism. He ran in the elections of May against Bogatyrets, taking a seat in the Assembly of Deputies, where he demanded a plebiscite over the territorial status of Bukovina and Maramureș. The election of November 1922 were held under the watch of National Liberal Party (PNL), which supported centralizing policies. During the race, the incumbent Rusyn Senator Jevhen Kozak was arrested and intimidated. Fearing persecution, Krakalia made his way into the opposition Peasants' Party; the other Ukrainian socialists soon came into contact with the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine, and were either arrested or pushed to leave Romania.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

Write an article based on this \\"The brother of a murdered private detective has urged the prime minister to continue with the second part of the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics.\\"","completion":"Title: The Continuing Quest for Press Ethics: A Murder Victim's Brother Pleads for the Resumption of the Leveson Inquiry Introduction The Leveson Inquiry, a significant investigation into the UK's media practices and ethics, remains a subject of intense discussion almost a decade after its initial launch. Prompted by the infamous phone-hacking scandal in 2011, the inquiry's extensive recommendations have nonetheless not been pursued in their entirety. Amidst growing pressure to resume its second part, the brother of a murdered private investigator has recently called upon the UK Prime Minister to follow through with the investigation, thereby addressing lingering concerns about press attitudes towards ethics and their potential role in the unsolved case. The Leveson Inquiry: A Refresher Lord Justice Leveson's public inquiry followed allegations of widespread phone hacking by Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper News of the World. The scandal, involving hacked voicemails and messages of celebrities, politicians, and even crime victims, rightfully provoked outrage, leading to the examination of not only News of the World, but other publications as well. Part one of the inquiry investigated the relationship between the press and the public, along with the extent to which current media practices adhered to ethical standards. It sought to balance press freedom with individual privacy concerns while addressing any potential criminal activity within news organisations. Meanwhile, the planned second part of the inquiry was set to address any additional illegal conduct and ties between news organisations, police, and politicians, but it has yet to be pursued. The Case of a Murdered Private Detective The case involving the unsolved murder of private detective Daniel Morgan – who, prior to his tragic death, had allegedly uncovered evidence of police corruption – has remained unresolved for more than 30 years. Morgan's brother has come forward, urging the British Government to continue with the second part of the Leveson Inquiry, especially since it could shed light on connections that might have contributed to Daniel's killing and the subsequent failure to bring his murderers to justice. This plea to the Prime Minister highlights various potential criminal implications and unsavoury relationships between the press and crime enforcement, emphasising the need to re-examine the media landscape more comprehensively. Resuming the Leveson Inquiry could serve to scrutinise unethical practices that perhaps still lurk within news reporting, and aid in solving the mystifying case that resulted in Daniel Morgan's untimely demise. Pursuing the Second Part of the Leveson Inquiry: Potential for Positive Change The continuation of the Leveson Inquiry could generate multiple benefits for the UK’s media landscape: 1. Accountability: Implementing the second part enables the prosecution of illegal and unethical conduct that was hitherto overlooked or suppressed. By fully examining connections between news organisations and law enforcement, it holds responsible parties accountable for their actions. 2. Restoration of Public Trust: With allegations of illegal cooperation between the media and government officials still looming heavily, the Leveson Inquiry’s continuation would send a clear message that unscrupulous tactics will not be tolerated. This would reinforce public trust in both the press and government institutions. 3. Improved Ethical Standards: Part two of the inquiry could strengthen media regulations and practices, filling in existing gaps and highlighting unethical practices. In turn, media outlets would be able to defy pressure to engage in sensationalist or harmful reporting, thanks to a regulatory environment that prioritises journalistic integrity. Conclusion The impassioned plea by a murder victim's brother highlights the urgency surrounding the necessity to revisit the second part of the Leveson Inquiry. Beyond addressing the broad implications of decades-old misconduct, the resumption of the investigation could also open the door to the prosecution of those linked to Daniel Morgan's tragic murder. Most importantly, the continuation of the inquiry would serve as a catalyst for a more transparent, accountable, and ethical media sphere – fostering trust in a powerful industry that wields considerable influence over public opinion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. and the situation: Two friends had a sleepover. They spent most of the time online looking up stuff and talking about it. Bill looked up the Gaia hypothesis, while Frank read about the Flat Earth theory. Answer the following question: Which friend read less about the composition of our atmosphere? A:","completion":"Based on the background information and the situation provided, it can be inferred that Frank, who read about the Flat Earth theory, likely read less about the composition of our atmosphere in comparison to Bill, who looked up the Gaia hypothesis. The Gaia hypothesis is directly related to the interactions and processes within the Earth's biosphere, which involve self-regulation of atmospheric conditions to maintain homeostasis. This hypothesis discusses the interconnections between different components of the Earth's system, such as the atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere, and how these components work together to maintain a stable environment suitable for life. Therefore, Bill's research on the Gaia hypothesis would have provided him with more information on the Earth's atmospheric composition and how it relates to the overall functioning of the biosphere. On the other hand, the Flat Earth theory is a belief that the Earth is flat, rather than an oblate spheroid as science demonstrates. While this theory might touch upon general information about the Earth's structure, it is not inherently focused on the composition of the atmosphere or processes maintaining Earth's homeostasis. Followers of this theory may challenge scientific explanations related to Earth's shape and its interaction with various celestial bodies but do not specifically center on the in-depth understanding of the Earth's atmosphere. Thus, it can be concluded that in this situation, Frank, who read about the Flat Earth theory, likely read less about the composition of our atmosphere than Bill, who looked up the Gaia hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you’ve been treating your wart but it isn’t improving, talk to your doctor to find out if you need additional treatments. Your doctor may be able to give you a stronger treatment than what you can find in the store. They may treat your wart in their office and might even be able to remove it. Alternatively, your doctor might offer you a prescription-strength topical cream. Sometimes warts can develop on your hands and feet, which might make it hard for you to carry out your daily activities. If this happens, talk to your doctor about treatment options that can help your wart heal faster. Then, follow your doctor’s advice so you can get back to your normal activities. Medical treatments can help your wart heal a lot faster than they would with home treatment. Try not to worry, but this could be a sign that what you have is more serious than a wart. For instance, it’s possible that your bump is skin cancer. Visit your doctor to get your skin examined so you can get a proper diagnosis. Then, discuss your treatment options with your doctor. It might just be a wart, so you probably don’t need to worry. However, it’s better to be safe than sorry.

You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, \\"I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves.\\" Question: In the first experiment, the subjects _ . - were not told that they would be stared at - lost their sense when they were stared at - were not sure when the would be stared at - were uncomfortable when they were stared at The answer is:","completion":"In the first experiment, the subjects were not told that they would be stared at."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I understand the input sentence is about a situation in a married life where spouses are advised not to take turns in preparing food. 2. The first change I make is replacing the word \\"sposati\\" with \\"in coppia\\". Both mean being in a relationship, but the latter is more general, not necessarily implying marriage. 3. Next, I change the context from cooking to another common household chore, cleaning the house. This change keeps the overall message similar and is semantically related. 4. Then, I make an additional small change in the verb used for describing the action. The word \\"fate\\" is replaced by the verb \\"delegate\\", which adds a little bit of difference, while still keeping the sentence structurally and semantically similar to the original. 5. These changes result in a sentence that has a high commonsense plausibility; it’s reasonable in many relationships for couples not to take turns in cleaning the house.

Article: Once there lived an old man in a mountain village. He was a famous hunter. He often went hunting alone in the mountains. He was not afraid of any wild animals, not even a tiger. One night, someone saw a tiger come into the village, and stole two sheep away. The next night the tiger came again. The villagers were frightened. They asked the old hunter to catch it so that they could have a safe life. When the old man heard about the tiger, he thought hard. He wondered why the tiger came at night twice but only stole the sheep. The next night he walked outside the village. Suddenly he saw the tiger coming. He quickly threw himself on the ground. To his surprise, the tiger did not come at him, but went away. He followed it quietly and found it was running on two of its feet just like a man. Then everything was clear. On the fourth day, when it got dark, the hunter took some animal skins with him and hid himself behind a big tree near the village. He was waiting for the \\"tiger\\". As soon as the \\"tiger\\" came near the tree, the old hunter jumped out, caught the \\"tiger\\" by the \\"leg\\" and said, \\"Don't be afraid. I do not mean to hurt you. You know who I am, don't you?\\" The \\"tiger\\" said \\"Yes\\" and took off the tiger's skin. \\"You are poor. But you mustn't steal anything from others. Here are some animal skins for you. You may sell them at the market. With the money, you can buy food and clothes for your family. Work harder and try to make a living. \\" With tears in his eyes, the poor man thanked the kind-hearted old hunter and walked home. Question: What did the old hunter do when he first saw the tiger?

Options: - haversack - desk - cabinet - backpack - house The answer is \\"backpack\\" because A:","completion":"The answer is \\"backpack\\" because a backpack is an ideal option for carrying scissors securely and conveniently from one building to another where you'll need to use them soon. Let's elaborate on why that's the best choice among the given options: 1. Haversack: While a haversack is a type of bag, it is typically smaller and used for carrying lightweight items. For items like scissors, which have sharp edges, a haversack may not be the most protective or secure choice to prevent accidental damage to the scissors or other items in the bag. Additionally, haversacks often have drawstring closures, which are less secure than zippers and may allow the scissors to fall out. 2. Desk: Placing the scissors on a desk would not be practical if you will need them in a different building shortly. The desk is stationary and located within a room, so leaving the scissors there would mean you would have to physically go back to the room to retrieve them, which defeats the purpose of having the scissors readily available for use in the other location. 3. Cabinet: Similar to the desk, a cabinet is also a stationary furniture piece that doesn't allow for easy transportation of items. Leaving the scissors in a cabinet would make it inconvenient and time-consuming to retrieve them when needed in the other building. 4. Backpack: A backpack is a versatile and secure choice for carrying items such as scissors. Backpacks typically have multiple compartments and zippered closures, making them a safe and efficient means of transporting items. The scissors can be placed in a specific compartment, protecting them from damage and ensuring they don't inadvertently damage other items in the backpack. With the scissors securely packed, it's easy to carry them and have them readily accessible when needed in the other building. 5. House: Placing the scissors inside the house would be impractical for the same reasons as the desk and cabinet options. The house is stationary, and leaving the scissors inside would require going back to retrieve them, which is neither efficient nor effective in ensuring their availability for use in the other building. In summary, a backpack is the best choice from the given options to securely hold and transport scissors that you will need to use in another building soon. It offers convenience, accessibility, and security, allowing you to quickly access and utilize the scissors when needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – How many trees are there on earth? A lot … or, more precisely, 3.04 trillion (about 422 per person on the planet, CNN notes). That's what some scientists discovered this year after conducting a global tree census, NPR reports. To put that number in context, it would take some 96,000 years to plant 3 trillion trees, if you were planting a tree per second, says ecologist Thomas Crowther, who led the study while working at Yale University. A previous estimate, based on satellite images, had the world's tree population at about 400 billion—some 7.5 times less than the new estimate, which was published September in the journal Nature. \\"It's a huge, astronomical number that I don't think I could comprehend before this study,\\" Crowther tells NPR. Still, Crowther cautions, \\"It's not like we discovered new trees,\\" so it's not time to say, \\"There's plenty left. No worries.\\" In fact, per Nature, the researchers think the total number of trees has been slashed nearly 50% in the last 12,000 years. And about 15 billion trees are cut down each year. The tree census involved getting tree counts in certain areas from people on the ground, using existing forest inventories, and entering the data into computer models. The whole thing started when Crowther's friend, part of the Billion Tree Campaign, was trying to figure out what kind of impact planting a billion trees would have. He asked Crowther how many trees are on the earth. At the time, Crowther tells NPR, \\"It doesn't seem like anyone had any idea.\\" Now they do … and the information could be used to weigh whether trees should be preserved, rather than cut down to make way for farms, a Stanford University ecologist tells Nature. (Droughts might be even worse for trees than we thought.)","completion":"How many trees are there on Earth? There are a lot of trees! About 3.04 trillion of them to be exact. That's like having 422 trees for every person on the planet! But what does trillion mean? Well, a trillion is a really, really big number that's almost too big for us to imagine. To give you an idea, if you wanted to plant 3 trillion trees and could plant one tree every second, it would take you 96,000 years to finish. That's a lot of trees! The scientists found out there were this many trees by doing a special count called a \\"Global Tree Census\\". Before, they thought there were only around 400 billion trees, but after these studies by the smart ecologist called Thomas Crowther and his friends, they discovered there are a lot more trees than that! However, just because there are a lot of trees doesn't mean we don't have to worry about them. Even though there are a lot of trees on Earth now, around 12,000 years ago there used to be almost double the number of trees we have today. And sadly, every year, people chop down about 15 billion trees! Thankfully, the scientists are using their new information about how many trees there are to help decide if they should try to save more trees instead of cutting them down to make way for farms and other things. So, even though there are a lot of trees, it's really important to take care of them and make sure we don't lose even more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a test of commonsense. Complete the next sentence: How to serve a tennis ball Get in position. Before you begin to serve the ball, you have to stand behind the baseline, on the side opposite the service box where you'll be serving. You should stand sideways, pointing your left foot to the opposite post of the net, with your right foot being parallel to the court.","completion":"Prepare the ball. Take a moment to select a ball that is in good condition, without any fraying seams or visible wear. Make sure it is of the appropriate pressure and bounce for a regulation tennis match. Keep additional balls close by so that if one is deemed unsuitable, you can quickly replace it. Correctly grip the racket. You'll want to grip the racket using the \\"Eastern\\" or \\"Continental\\" grip, as these are the most common grips for serving. For the Eastern grip, ensure that the base knuckle of your forefinger is against the third bevel of the racket handle, while the Continental grip places that same knuckle on the second bevel. Both grips keep the racket face at an optimal angle for serving. Bounce the ball. As a matter of preference and timing, bounce the ball a few times on the ground, being mindful of your nerves and the rhythm you want to establish. This can help you feel comfortable and focused on the task at hand. Initiate your toss. With the ball in your non-dominant hand (left hand, if you are right-handed), hold your arm and hand straight without any bend in your wrist. As you bend your knees slightly, you will toss the ball in front of you, emphasizing a smooth and controlled motion, with the goal of achieving a consistent and reliable toss trajectory. As a general rule, you should aim to toss the ball around 1 to 2 feet above your maximum reach. Simultaneously, as you start to toss the ball, begin the backswing of your racket by bending your dominant elbow and bringing it back, so that it forms an approximate 90-degree angle (similar to a trophy pose). This will help you generate power during the next phase of your serve, the upward motion. Hit the ball. Just before reaching the peak of the toss, use your legs to propel your body upwards (a motion called \\"loading\\"), and extend your racket-arm towards the ball. Keep your eye on the ball as you make contact with it with the middle of your racket strings, aiming at a slight downward angle to ensure it clears the net while still landing in the correct service box. Follow through. As you make contact with the ball, allow your natural momentum to guide the follow through. Ideally, your racket should complete a fluid arc over your shoulder, with your body weight shifting forward into the court. Recover and prepare for the return. Once you have completed your serve, quickly return to a ready position, with your racket hand close to your body and both feet shoulder width apart. This ensures that you are prepared to handle any return shots from your opponent. Remember to practice your serve frequently, as consistency and accuracy are key factors in reducing errors and improving your overall game. Being able to rely on your serve during crucial moments in a match can make the difference between winning and losing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future). Paragraph: Last week, an exact clone of Earth appeared next to our current Earth. Scientists have come to call this new planet, Terra. Terra has the exact same cities, civilizations and history as Earth. Scientists are completely baffled as to how this planet exists, but it undeniably does. The only difference between Earth and Terra is that the citizens of Terra output half as many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as citizens of Earth do. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Terra have more or less concentration of carbon dioxide than Earth? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Terra has less concentration of carbon dioxide than Earth. Since the citizens of Terra output half as many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as citizens of Earth do, this would lead to a lower concentration of carbon dioxide on Terra compared to Earth. The reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, would result in a slower rate of climate change and a lower overall concentration of these gases in Terra's atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

Standing on the steps of the Supreme Court, Scott Lively, president of Abiding Truth Ministries, told reporters he’s filing a motion with the Supreme Court calling for the recusal of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. ADVERTISEMENT “Justices Ginsburg and Kagan, knowing full well that unique legal issues regarding the definition of marriage would soon come before them, deliberately officiated at so-called homosexual wedding ceremonies creating not merely the appearance of bias, but an actual and blatant conflict of interest,” he said. “In my personal view they have committed an unparalleled breach of judicial ethics by elevating the importance of their own favored political cause of gay rights above the integrity of the court and of our nation.” The case before the court, known as Obergefell v. Hodges, stems from a 6th Circuit Court of Appeals decision to uphold same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan and Kentucky. The court has grouped the appeals from the couples in the four states together and will hear two and a half hours of arguments Tuesday morning, 90 minutes more than the court typically allows. In their rulings, the justices will seek to answer whether states are required to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and whether states have to recognize same-sex marriage licenses from other states under the 14th Amendment. Lively said Kagan and Ginsburg's “vividly demonstrated disposition” in favor of the same-sex couples shows they are unable to render a fair judgment. He and more than a dozen leaders of anti-gay-marriage groups stood behind a wall of empty cardboard filing boxes stacked on the steps of the court on Monday morning. The boxes — 60 in all — were there to \\"symbolically\\" represent 300,000 restraining orders that Faith2Action President Janet Porter said will be delivered to the Supreme Court and to Congress to keep the justices from ruling on gay marriage. “We have appealed to Congress to restrain the judges, and the good news is Congress has heard our cry,” Porter said. Last week, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced the Restrain the Judges on Marriage Act of 2015, which would remove jurisdiction to rule on gay marriage from federal courts. In the Senate, Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzGroup aiming to draft Beto O’Rourke unveils first 2020 video Howard Dean looking for a 'younger, newer' Democratic nominee in 2020 Congress can stop the war on science MORE (R-Texas) has introduced The Protect Marriage from the Courts Act, which would also limit the federal courts’ jurisdiction to consider same-sex marriage cases. “Congress has the ability to remove appellate jurisdiction,” Porter said. “What that means is, we can actually take from them their right to rule on marriage before they even rule on marriage.” During the press conference, Larry Sternbane, 51, stood quietly back behind the crowd holding a sign that read, “Don’t like gay marriage? Don’t get gay married.” “This right here is the last gasp of a group that is losing this issue in the public square,” he said. “They are talking to themselves. There are a bunch of tourists listening, and the only ones clapping when somebody ends is them.” ||||| Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the West conference room at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post via Getty) Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the 82-year-old leader of the Supreme Court’s minority liberal wing, has cast aside her usual restraint in the past months and left little doubt where she stands on the upcoming gay marriage case. The Supreme Court hears arguments in the case, Obergefell v. Hodges, on Tuesday, and will most likely announce in June whether states will still be allowed to ban same-sex marriage and refuse to recognize the rights of couples married in other states. Ginsburg, a former civil rights lawyer, has been uncharacteristically outspoken in advance of one of the most significant civil rights decisions in decades. In August, she became the first Supreme Court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding. Since then, she’s highlighted the big shift in public opinion on gay marriage in interviews and public speeches, breaking from her usual reticence when it comes to talking about upcoming cases. In February, Ginsburg told Bloomberg that it “would not take a large adjustment” for Americans to accept nationwide marriage equality, given the “enormous” change in people’s attitudes about same-sex marriage. New York Times columnist Gail Collins wrote in January that Ginsburg has a “strong hunch” about the way the case will turn out. “I would be very surprised if the Supreme Court retreats from what it has said about same-sex unions,” Ginsburg told Collins, referencing the 2012 decision that found the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages. Two anti-gay-marriage groups, the National Organization for Marriage and the American Family Association, have since called on Ginsburg to recuse herself, arguing that she can no longer be impartial. They’ve also targeted Justice Elena Kagan for officiating at a same-sex marriage, asking her to step down from the case, too. Legal experts say the calls for recusal are unwarranted, given the 2012 ruling that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages in states that allow them. The constitutional issue at stake in the current case is whether states can ban same-sex marriage at all. Officiating at a same-sex marriage in a jurisdiction that already allows it does not call into question the justices’ impartiality on that question, according to Columbia Law School professor Jamal Greene. SLIDESHOW: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: A look back >>> The earlier gay rights decision gives Ginsburg more leeway to comment on the issue generally. Though the court did not find a fundamental right to marriage, the majority opinion held that same-sex marriages have an essential “dignity” like any other marriage and that the federal government does not have a good reason to discriminate against them by refusing to recognize them. “She’s not saying anything that she hasn’t said in an opinion,” said Margo Schlanger, a former Ginsburg clerk who is now a law professor at the University of Michigan. “So it’s not like, ‘Wow, that’s a new one and the court hasn’t ruled on it since Baker v. Nelson,’” she said, referencing the 1972 case that upheld a state same-sex marriage ban after the court refused to hear the appeal.

(Associated Press) The justices are meeting Tuesday to offer the first public indication of where they stand in the dispute over whether states can continue defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman, or whether the Constitution gives gay and lesbian couples the right to marry. The court is hearing extended arguments, scheduled to last 2 ½ hours, which also will explore whether states that do not permit same-sex marriage must nonetheless recognize such unions from elsewhere. Same-sex couples can marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The cases before the court come from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, four of the 14 remaining states that allow only heterosexual marriage. Those four states had their marriage bans upheld by the federal appeals court in Cincinnati in November. That is the only federal appeals court that has ruled in favor of the states since the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law. Justice Anthony Kennedy has written the court's three prior gay rights decisions, including the case from two years ago. All eyes will be on Kennedy for any signals that he is prepared to take the final step in granting marriage rights to same-sex couples. Such an outcome was inconceivable just a few years ago. The first state to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry was Massachusetts, in 2004. Even as recently as October, barely a third of the states permitted it. Now, same-sex couples can marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia, a dramatic change in the law that has been accompanied by an equally fast shift in public opinion. The main thrust of the states' case is to reframe the debate. \\"This case is not about the best marriage definition. It is about the fundamental question regarding how our democracy resolves such debates about social policy: Who decides, the people of each state or the federal judiciary?\\" John Bursch, representing Michigan, wrote in his main brief to the court. Other arguments by the states and more than five-dozen briefs by their defenders warn the justices of harms that could result \\"if you remove the man-woman definition and replace it with the genderless any-two-persons definition,\\" said Gene Schaerr, a Washington lawyer. The push for same-sex marriage comes down to fairness, said Mary Bonauto, who will argue on behalf of the plaintiffs. The people who have brought their cases to the Supreme Court are \\"real people who are deeply committed to each other. Yet they are foreclosed from making that commitment simply because of who they are,\\" she told reporters last week. Arguments made by Bonauto, other lawyers for same-sex couples and more than six-dozen supporting briefs have strong echoes of the 1967 Loving v. Virginia case, in which the Supreme Court struck down state bans on interracial marriage. In that case, the justices were unanimous that those bans violated the constitutional rights of interracial couples. No one expects unanimity this time. But many believe the justices will take the final step toward what gay rights supporters call marriage equality, in part because they allowed orders in favor of same-sex couples to take effect even as the issue made its way through the federal court system. That was action through inaction, as other judges played a major role over the years. Only 11 states have granted marriage rights to same-sex couples through the ballot or the legislature. Court rulings are responsible for all the others. A decision is expected in late June. ___ Follow Mark Sherman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/shermancourt . ||||| The scene outside the Supreme Court today felt a lot like a football game tailgate party -- and for supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage who have spent days camped out to score a seat, Tuesday's oral arguments are the Super Bowl. The justices will hear arguments into two related questions: one, whether states must allow same-sex couples to marry; and two, whether states must recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. There were at least sixty groups -- mainly supporters, but also some opponents -- who had been waiting on the corner of First and East Capitol Streets for days, hoping for a coveted chair inside the courtroom. Frank Colasonti Jr. and his husband James Ryder of Birmingham, Michigan, were among the first in line. They said they had been there since Friday evening, snoozing in sleeping bags and hiding under tarps when it rained. But the partners for 27 years, husbands for the last one, said this argument was too important not to try to attend. \\"We really never thought ...\\" Colasonti said before getting choked up. \\"We really never thought we'd see it in our lifetime,\\" Ryder said, finishing his husband’s sentence. \\"It really never seemed like an option that it would ever happen,\\" he continued, noting that they had filed their income taxes jointly for the first time this year. The couple was among some 300 spouses who married on a single day in 2014 when Michigan's gay marriage ban was temporarily lifted. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder later said he would not contest the validity of those marriages although the ban was reinstated. Michigan is one of four states arguing in favor of their same-sex marriage bans. The others are Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. Besides the many same-sex couples and their families who flocked from those states, there were many law students who wanted to see a case that future classes will likely study. \\"However this is decided it's going to be one of the most iconic and well-read cases in casebooks so this is going to be really exciting to be here,\\" Wyatt Fore, a third-year law student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor said. He said he had been in place, lawn chair and law books in tow, since Friday night. Emotions and opinions on both sides of Tuesday's arguments run high, but at this unique gathering of legal minds, students, same-sex couples and pastors, the tendency is to live and let live -- or in this case, wait and let wait. Pastor Rick Grogan of Fort Worth, Texas, acknowledged that he was one of the few opponents of same-sex marriage camped out, a buoy in a sea of Human Rights Campaign banners and rainbow flags. \\"You've got, what, 20-something states who have banned it in their constitution. Now, nine people are going to tell the whole nation what to do,\\" he said, sprawled on a blanket with an opened Bible in his hand. But he said the discourse among his neighbors had been respectful. After all, if people toss footballs around during a pre-game tailgate, why wouldn't they engage in elevated debate before a Supreme Court argument? \\"Even though people disagree, it's been pleasant so far,\\" Grogan said. As he spoke, a group of same-sex marriage supporters from Kentucky posed for a group picture, just steps away. ||||| Hard to imagine any of that happening to John Roberts . The retirement talk started around 2011, when the Harvard Law School professor Randall Kennedy wrote an essay in The New Republic arguing that both Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer should quit while there was still a Democratic president to nominate replacements. “What’s more, both are, well, old,” he added uncharitably. As time moved on, the focus shifted almost exclusively to Ginsburg (“Justice Ginsburg: Resign Already!”). Perhaps that’s simply because she is older than Breyer, who is now 76. Or perhaps there’s still an expectation that women are supposed to be good sports, and volunteer to take one for the team. From the beginning, Ginsburg waved off the whole idea. (“And who do you think Obama could have nominated and got confirmed that you’d rather see on a court?”) Anyway, since Republicans took control of the Senate in January, it’s become pretty clear that ship has sailed. “People aren’t saying it as much now,” she said with what sounded like some satisfaction. Obviously, a time will come. But as far as clarity on the bench, productivity and overall energy go, that time doesn’t at all seem to be at hand. Her medical history is studded with near disasters — colon cancer in 1999, and pancreatic cancer 10 years later. Both times she returned to the bench quickly. (In the latter case, Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky apologized for predicting she’d probably be dead within nine months.) Last year she had a stent placed in one of her coronary arteries. That happened on a Wednesday, and the court’s public information officer quickly told reporters that Ginsburg “expects to be on the bench on Monday.” HER physical fierceness is legend. Scalia, her improbable good friend, once recounted a summer when he and Ginsburg had both snagged a gig teaching on the French Riviera. “She went off parasailing!” he told The Washington Post. “This little skinny thing, you’d think she’d never come down.” She has since given up that sort of recreation, but she still works out twice a week in the Supreme Court gym with her personal trainer. Plus there are the daily stretching exercises at home. At night. After work. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It’s the combination of Ginsburg’s woman-hear-me-roar history, her frail-little-old-lady appearance and her role as the leader of the Supreme Court’s dissident liberals that have rallied her new fan base, particularly young women. The second woman to be appointed to the Supreme Court, she’s part of the generation who came of age after World War II and led a revolution that transformed women’s legal rights, as well as their role in the public world. There’s a famous story about the dean at Harvard Law inviting Ginsburg and her tiny group of fellow female law students to dinner, then asking them how they’d justify having taken a place that could have gone to a man. Ginsburg was so flustered she answered that her husband, Marty, was a law student and that it was very important for a wife to understand her husband’s work. “That’s what I said,” she nodded. The dean, Ginsburg said, told her later that he had asked only because “there were still doubting Thomases on the faculty and he wanted the women to arm him with stories.” You have to wonder if the dean was trying to rewrite history. Or maybe joking. But Ginsburg believed the explanation: “He was a wonderful man, but he had no sense of humor.” During law school Marty Ginsburg developed testicular cancer . Ruth helped him keep up with his work by bringing him notes from his classes and typing up his papers, while also taking care of their toddler, Jane. Plus, she made the Harvard Law Review. This is the kind of story that defines a certain type of New Woman of Ginsburg’s generation — people whose gift for overachievement and overcoming adversity is so immense, you can see how even a nation of men bent on maintaining the old patriarchal order were simply run over by the force of their determination. (Ginsburg herself isn’t given to romanticizing. Asked why the women’s rights revolution happened so quickly, she simply said: “Well, the tide was in our favor. We were riding with winners.”) Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

She has a son, a daughter and four grandchildren, one of whom called and said “Bubbe, you were sleeping at the State of the Union!” after the cameras caught her famous nap. She travels constantly. The day we talked, she was preparing to go off to a meeting of the New York City Bar, where she would introduce Gloria Steinem , who would deliver the Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Distinguished Lecture on Women and the Law. A few weeks earlier, at a gathering of the Association of American Law Schools, Ginsburg had introduced her old friend Professor Herma Hill Kay, recipient of the Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lifetime Achievement Award. When you reach this kind of stature, there are lots of echoes. She’s spent much of her life being the first woman doing one thing or another, and when it comes to the retirement question, she has only one predecessor to contemplate — her friend Sandra Day O’Connor, the first female Supreme Court justice, who left the bench at 75 to spend more time with her husband, John, who was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease . “She and John were going to do all the outdoorsy things they liked to do,” Ginsburg recalled. But John O’Connor’s condition deteriorated so swiftly that her plans never worked out. Soon, Ginsburg said, “John was in such bad shape that she couldn’t keep him at home.” O’Connor has kept busy — speaking, writing, hearing cases on a court of appeals and pursuing a project to expand civics education. But it’s not the same as being the swing vote on the United States Supreme Court. “I think she knows that when she left that term, every 5-4 decision when I was in the minority, I would have been in the majority if she’d stayed,” Ginsburg said. Besides not retiring, another thing Ginsburg is planning not to do is write her memoirs. “There are too many people writing about me already,” she said. There’s an authorized biography in the works, along with several other projects to which she has definitely not given a blessing. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “But now — this is something I like,” she said, picking up a collection of essays, “The Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” The justice also seems to be looking forward to an upcoming “Notorious R.B.G.” book, written by Shana Knizhnik, who created the blog, and Irin Carmon of MSNBC. The name started as a play on the name of the Brooklyn gangsta rapper Notorious B.I.G. , but it’s taken on a life of its own as a younger-generation tribute to Ginsburg. “The kind of raw excitement that surrounds her is palpable,” Carmon said. “There’s a counterintuitiveness. We have a particular vision of someone who’s a badass — a 350-pound rapper. And she’s this tiny Jewish grandmother. She doesn’t look like our vision of power, but she’s so formidable, so unapologetic, and a survivor in every sense of the word.” So Ginsburg is planning to be on the bench when the Supreme Court decides mammoth issues like the future of the Affordable Care Act and a national right for gay couples to marry. She says she doesn’t know how the health care case will turn out. But like practically every court observer in the country, she has a strong hunch about which way gay marriage will go: “I would be very surprised if the Supreme Court retreats from what it has said about same-sex unions.” The speed with which the country has already accepted gay rights was, she theorized, just a matter of gay people coming out, and the rest of the country realizing that “we all knew and liked and loved people who were gay.” She recalled Justice Lewis Powell, who told his colleagues he had never met a gay person, unaware that he’d had several gay law clerks. “But they never broadcast it.” The National Organization for Marriage, a conservative group, recently demanded that Ginsburg recuse herself from the case since she had said that it would not be difficult for the American public to accept a ruling in favor of a national right to gay marriage. Don’t hold your breath. ||||| It’s come to this: Even those who most strongly oppose gay marriage think the Supreme Court is likely to support a constitutional right to same-sex unions — and are looking beyond Tuesday’s legal arguments to demand that Congress intervene. Wielding placards supporting “traditional marriage” and reciting prayers for divine intervention, pastors and other social conservatives who gathered on the court’s steps Monday sounded resigned to a ruling they believe would be deeply damaging to the nation. Story Continued Below “We recognize that we are at a crossroads like never before in this nation’s history,” the American Decency Association’s Bill Johnson said, urging gay-marriage opponents to hope for the best but brace for the worst. “I would just say to each one of us that there is still that possibility that, despite the darkness of the day, that God answers prayers.” “We now perhaps are days away from this very court telling us that holy matrimony between one man and one woman, ordained by God in the Garden of Eden … is merely a relic of a bygone era,” added Kay Daly of the Coalition for a Fair Judiciary. “I’m hopeful but, at the same time, I have a great deal of trepidation.” On Tuesday, the court will hear arguments on same-sex marriage cases that could lead to a ruling forcing every state to certify gay unions. The justices’ endorsement of such a sweeping constitutional right was almost unthinkable even a decade ago, but jurisprudence has changed so quickly — alongside public opinion — that even two of the court’s most die-hard conservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, seemed to concede earlier this year that the court was moving toward granting a right to marry. Thus, those who inveighed against the evils of same-sex marriage outside the court building on Monday were already looking past the justices to Congress, urging lawmakers to support legislation that would strip federal courts of jurisdiction over marriage-related litigation and forbid officials from spending federal funds to enforce whatever the Supreme Court holds in a ruling expected by late June. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced a bill last week that would make both such moves. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has proposed a similar measure, along with a constitutional amendment that would prohibit the federal government from interfering with state gay-marriage bans. The anti-gay-rights activists’ concern that they may need such measures is not without foundation. While the comments of legal pundits are easy to dismiss as mere speculation, the court’s most conservative justices also seem to be among those who see the writing on the wall. In February, when the Supreme Court refused to block an appeals court ruling requiring Alabama to recognize same-sex marriage, Thomas and Scalia joined to warn that the justices’ refusal to step in “may well be seen as a signal of the Court’s intended resolution” of the marriage cases it will hear Tuesday. The pair of conservative justices never made exactly clear if they agreed or disagreed with the likely public assessment of where the court would come out, but their overall tone suggested that a ruling in favor of same-sex marriage might be inevitable. Many legal observers predicted it would be at least several years before the issue of same-sex marriage returned to the high court after a pair of decisions the justices issued in 2013. One landmark, 5-4 ruling in the case of Windsor v. U.S. struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. But the justices passed up on technical grounds a case out of California where they could have resolved the issue definitively. The move punted the issue back to the lower federal courts, which acted with surprising speed and near-unanimity to strike down gay-marriage bans across the country. “I don’t know if it’s a rocket docket,” said Daly. “This is dangerous in a lot of ways … It’s gratifying in one sense. It’s terrifying in another.” However, some conservatives believe the court actually acted too slowly, particularly when it decided last October not to take up appeals from five states that asked the justices to confront the issue head-on. That gave other courts more time to issue more rulings in favor of same-sex marriage, eventually spreading the practice to 37 states. The flurry of rulings, and the justices’ refusal to stay them, created a kind of on-the-ground momentum that could be hard for the justices to reverse. “The combination of this broadly worded but deeply confusing opinion in Windsor, coupled with their refusal to take responsibility for what lower courts have done with it, is significant,” said University of Richmond Law professor Kevin Walsh. “Once it became clear what lower courts were doing with the decision in Windsor, [the justices] should have addressed whether the Constitution requires recognizing same-sex marriage.” A crowd gathering in advance of Tuesday's Supreme Court hearing on gay marriage. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO In January, the high court finally agreed to wade into the issue again, granting review to cases from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee after the federal appeals court with jurisdiction over those states — the Sixth Circuit — bucked the trend and ruled against same-sex marriage rights. There’s a broad expectation that the Supreme Court is likely to rule at least 5-4 in favor of a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage, with Republican-appointed Justice Anthony Kennedy joining the court’s Democratic appointees expected to back such a right. A total of five lawyers are expected to square off during the scheduled 2½ hours of argument Tuesday. Two private attorneys — Mary Bonauto of Gay and Lesbian Advocates & Defenders and Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, a former lawyer in the Justice Department’s Office of Solicitor General — will argue in favor of same-sex marriage rights, as will Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. Arguing for the four state bans on gay marriage will be former Michigan Solicitor General John Bursch and Joseph Whalen, who works in the office of Tennessee’s solicitor general. Advocates for same-sex marriage rights are expected to argue that there’s no rational basis for prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying and that, even if there were, measures that discriminate against gays and lesbians should be subjected to heightened scrutiny that such bans can’t possibly meet. The lawyers for the states counter that there are a variety of reasons to allow states to enforce such bans, including a respect for voters who put the measures in place. Other reasons revolve around a kind of autonomy for states, as well as longtime justifications for same-sex marriage bans, including promoting male-female marriages, and encouraging procreation and child rearing. While it hasn’t received much discussion, there is a potential twist in how the court could rule on same-sex marriage. When the justices agreed to hear the four cases in January, the court not only asked lawyers to address the issue of whether the Constitution requires states to allow gay couples to marry but also added a question about whether states should be required to recognize marriages approved in other states. That raises the possibility that a majority of judges could stop short of requiring states to allow same-sex couples to marry, but insist that states accept as married any couple legally married in another state. That would allow states to maintain their same-sex marriage bans, but cure some of the problems gay and lesbian married couples face relating to hospital visitation, inheritance, divorce and child-raising. Gay rights advocates sounded confident Tuesday that the massive shift in public opinion in favor of same-sex marriage would propel the justices toward the more sweeping ruling. “Simply put, this isn’t a question any longer of a country evolving. This country has evolved,” Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said, echoing President Barack Obama’s language as his position on the issue morphed from opposing gay marriage to embracing it. “Now, it’s just a question of when our laws will finally catch up,” Griffin added. The plaintiff whose name leads off the cases the Supreme Court will hear Tuesday, Jim Obergefell of Ohio, said he’s surprised at how quickly the country has come to accept same-sex marriage in the wake of the last pair of rulings from the justices in 2013. “The last two years it’s been amazing how much has changed and how quickly it’s changed,” said Obergefell, who married his terminally ill, long-term partner John Arthur in an unusual ceremony aboard a medical aircraft at the Baltimore airport in 2013. Arthur died a few months later. Obergefell is fighting for the right to be listed as Arthur’s husband on his death certificate. “What I hope will happen in June is long overdue, but I have to be happy that it is on the verge of happening,” Obergefell said. ||||| Lawyers and friends of Kennedy are reluctant to speak for the record, but most of them do not believe his views on gay rights stem from personal experience, such as having a child, relative or close friend who is gay.

Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Usage: 'I_LOOK' corresponds to the command 'look'. It meets the criteria because it is one of the specified actions and its command is in lowercase. Part #2: Directional words 'left' and 'right'. Usage: In the command 'turn left', 'left' denotes the direction of turning. It meets the criteria because it is used to specify the direction of an action. Part #3: The word 'opposite' for turning the agent backward. Usage: For the action pair 'I_TURN_LEFT' followed by 'I_TURN_RIGHT', the command would be 'turn left and turn right'. It meets the criteria because it follows the instruction that the word 'and' can be used to execute multiple actions sequentially. Part #4: The word 'around' to execute an action while turning around. Usage: For 'I_TURN_LEFT' followed by 'I_JUMP', the command would be 'jump around left'. It meets the criteria because it demonstrates that an action like 'jump' can be executed while the agent turns around in a specified direction. Part #5: The word 'and' for executing multiple actions sequentially. Usage: In the command 'turn left and walk', the agent will 'turn left' and then 'walk'. It meets the criteria because it follows the instruction that the word 'and' means executing the next action after the previous one. Part #6: The word 'after' for indicating the order of actions. Usage: In the command 'walk after turn left', the agent will 'turn left' and then 'walk'.

Now, we want to isolate \\"l\\" by adding 66 to both sides of the equation. 6*l - 66 + 66 = 0 + 66 6*l = 66 Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by 6 to isolate \\"l\\".

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I went about it: 1. I started by going through the given list: [-62, 6, -29, -32, -63, -82, 59, -38, 95, -1] 2. Next, I checked each number in the list to determine if it's even or odd. 3. An even number is any number that is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. In other words, if a number can be divided by 2 and results in a whole number, it's considered even. Now I will check each number: - -62 is even, since it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder (-62/2 = -31). - 6 is even (6/2 = 3). - -29 is odd since it can't be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder (-29/2 = -14.5). - -32 is even (-32/2 = -16). - -63 is odd (-63/2 = -31.5). - -82 is even (-82/2 = -41). - 59 is odd (59/2 = 29.5). - -38 is even (-38/2 = -19). - 95 is odd (95/2 = 47.5). - -1 is odd (-1/2 = -0.5). 4. Based on the above checks, I removed the odd numbers from the list and kept only the even numbers: [-62, 6, -32, -82, -38]. 5. Lastly, I returned the list containing only the even numbers within brackets to meet the formatting requirements: [-62, 6, -32, -82, -38] So, the output is: [-62, 6, -32, -82, -38]"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In June 1426 Hussite forces, led by Prokop and Sigismund Korybut, significantly defeated the invaders in the Battle of Aussig. Despite this result, the death of Jan Žižka caused many, including Pope Martin V, to believe that the Hussites were much weakened. Martin proclaimed yet another crusade in 1427. He appointed Cardinal Henry Beaufort of England as Papal Legate of Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia, to lead the crusader forces. The crusaders were defeated at the Battle of Tachov. The Hussites subsequently invaded parts of Germany several times, though they made no attempt to occupy permanently any part of the country. Korybut was imprisoned in 1427 for allegedly conspiring to surrender the Hussite forces to Sigismund of Hungary. He was released in 1428, and participated in the Hussite invasion of Silesia. But after a few years, Korybut returned to Poland with his men. Korybut and his Poles, however, did not really want to leave; but the Pope threatened to call a crusade against Poland if they did not.

Saying Investigation Is Over, Police Release Final Sandy Hook Shooting Report Authorities in Connecticut released a final report on Friday outlining the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012, providing the most complete account to date for one of the nationâs most wrenching massacres. It contained hundreds of photographs, hours of video and voluminous crime scene reports. The stateâs Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection said that the release of the full report, which included many redactions, âis indicative that this State Police criminal investigation is concluded.â Questions of how and when to release sensitive investigative details from the shooting have been prevalent since shortly after the massacre, which left 20 first graders and six adults from the school dead. The shooter, Adam Lanza, 20, also killed his mother and himself. In a letter accompanying the report, Reuben F. Bradford, the commissioner of the stateâs Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, said that the names and âcontextually identifying information of involved childrenâ were withheld, including descriptions of the children, their clothing and their belongings. He added that âall visual images depicting the deceased have been withheld, as well as written descriptions whose disclosure would be highly offensive to a reasonable person and would violate the constitutional rights of the families.â Mr. Bradford said that balancing the âoften competing interests of government transparency and individual privacy has been difficult.â Stephen J. Sedensky III, the stateâs attorney in Danbury, had fought to keep private the recordings of 911 calls made from the school. But Judge Eliot D. Prescott of the Superior Court in New Britain ruled last month that there was no legal basis to keep the recordings secret; they were released on Dec. 4. He said their release âmay serve to vindicate and support the professionalism and bravery of first responders.â The recordsâ release on Friday followed the issuance of a far shorter report last month by Mr. Sedenskyâs office. At the time, the account provided the most detail yet about Mr. Lanzaâs final months â his bedroom windows covered with black trash bags, as he passed time playing violent video games and spoke to his mother only over email, even though they shared a floor in a house on Yogananda Street. But the stateâs attorneyâs report did not offer a motive for the massacre. It also did not name the children who died, nor did it include graphic descriptions of the crime scene. âThere is no clear indication why Sandy Hook Elementary School was selected,â Mr. Sedensky wrote then, âother than perhaps its close proximity to the shooterâs home.â Mr. Lanza had created a spreadsheet of some of the worst massacres in American history, according to the authorities, and seemed to carefully plan his attack. According to information from a GPS device, he had driven to the area of the school one day earlier, while his mother was away. Around 9:34 a.m. on Dec. 14, Mr. Lanza blasted through the glass windows at the schoolâs locked entrance, the police said. At 9:40, he shot himself in a first-grade classroom. Mr. Bradford, from the Emergency Services and Public Protection Department, said that while the investigation was closed âfor administrative purposes,â additional supplemental reports might be released in the coming months. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Connecticut authorities released a final report on the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that took place on December 14, 2012, in Newtown.

Information about the deceased was also withheld, as it would violate the constitutional rights of the families. Balancing government transparency and individual privacy has been challenging during the investigation and release of the Sandy Hook report. Last month, recordings of 911 calls from the school were released, following a judge’s decision. The motive for the shooting is still unclear, but it is suggested that Lanza selected Sandy Hook Elementary School due to its close proximity to his home.

You’ll notice the metal is actually organized into thin strips that all point in one direction. Unless otherwise noted, clean along the grain of the stainless steel. Use a damp, soapy washcloth to wipe the surface along the grain. Rinse the washcloth with clean water, then wipe the stainless steel appliance again. Wipe it with a dry cloth to prevent water spots. Cleaners containing chlorides (including iodine, bromine, chlorine, and fluorine) can cause pitting and damage your stainless steel. Alcohol, ammonia, or mineral spirits can also hurt the protective layer over the steel surface. Finally, abrasive steel wool or steel brushes can scratch the stainless steel surface and encourage rust.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Regretting that tattoo you got? Cheer up: There's a good chance a dermatologist can remove it for you -- but success is going to depend on a number of factors, including how big the tattoo is, what colors it contains and whether you smoke. Italian researchers who treated 352 people between 1995 and 2010 say they are the first to fully explore the factors that make some tattoos harder to remove than others. Their findings were published online Monday in the Archives of Dermatology. The doctors used the current standard procedure for tattoo removal, which involves repeated laser treatments spaced several weeks apart. The devices they used, called Q-switched lasers, removed tattoos for 47% of patients in 10 sessions, nearly 75% in 15 sessions. But success varied. Tattoos were harder to remove if they were: -- More than 12 inches. -- Colors other than black or red. -- More than three years old. -- On feet or legs. -- On a smoker. Smoking may impair natural healing processes that help clear ink after treatment, researchers say. A separate study in the journal looked at a newer laser, not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and found it removed more than 75% of tattoo ink in an average of four sessions. But the study of the picosecond laser included only 12 patients and did not directly compare it with the standard lasers. It was partially funded by Cynosure, Inc., the manufacturer. Typical side effects for any laser treatment can include pain, redness and swelling, says Nazanin Saedi, director of laser surgery and cosmetic dermatology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. She worked on the study of the picosecond laser when she was a fellow at SkinCare Physicians in Chestnut Hills, Mass. But it's the cost, in time and money that discourages many peoplewho want their tattoos removed, says George Hruza, clinical professor of dermatology at St. Louis University in Missouri. He says he charges 200 to 600 per laser session, depending on how big and difficult-to-remove a tattoo is. He says doctors are experimenting with several techniques that might speed up a process that can take a year or two and, in extreme cases, \\"cost as much as car.\\" Still, it's a growing business, Hruza says, thanks to the rising popularity of tattoos and the inevitable regrets among some people who get them. \\"Some people come in a week after they get the tattoo,\\" he adds. Maybe it's a good thing that most people seem to like their tattoos: 21% of adults have at least one tattoo and just 14% of those who have them regret them, according to a recent ||||| As growing numbers of people rue the tattoos they got in their youth, a new study has found that tattoo removal is less likely to succeed if the person is a smoker, the design contains colors such as blue or yellow and is larger than 12 inches. The study is believed to be the first research that looked at several factors—which included tattoo size and location on the body—involved with successful tattoo removal, according to the researchers. As more people rue the tattoos they got in their youth, a new study has found that tattoo removal is less likely to succeed if the skin design contains certain colors. Jennifer Corbett Dorren has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Getty Images. The standard procedure for removing tattoos currently is treatment with a laser called a Q-switched laser, or QSL, applied over a number of sessions. But the technique can lose its effectiveness depending on certain variables, according to the study, published online on Monday in the American Medical Association's Archives of Dermatology. Smoking, for instance, can reduce by 70% the chance of successfully removing a tattoo after 10 treatment sessions. Dermatologists have long known certain colors are easier to remove than others, but the findings on the impact of smoking on tattoo removal are new. The research was conducted at a laser-surgery center in Milan, Italy, from 1995 through 2010. There were 352 people in the study, of which 201 were men, with a median age of 30 years old. As many as 22% of U.S. college students have at least one tattoo, according to background information in the study, and about half of people who get tattoos later try to have them removed. In order to remove tattoos, patients must undergo about 10 laser treatments several weeks apart. The light from the laser targets pigments in the ink of the tattoo and helps the ink break down. Over time the ink is removed through the body's lymphatic system. Each treatment costs about 200 and isn't covered by insurance. Overall, the study found about 47% of people had their tattoos successfully removed after 10 laser treatments and it took 15 treatments to remove tattoos from 75% of patients. Black and red pigments in tattoos were most easily removed. All-black tattoos had a 58% successful-removal rate, while tattoos with black and red pigments had a 51% success rate after 10 treatments. The presence of other colors such as greens, yellows or blues reduced the chances of effective removal of a tattoo by as much as 80%, the study found. Other factors that reduced the procedure's success included a design larger than 12 inches or one located on the feet or legs. Karthik Krishnamurthy, director of the cosmetic dermatology clinic at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, N.Y., who wasn't involved in the study, explained that black and red inks absorb the wavelength of light emitted by the QSL laser better than other colors. Older tattoos are harder to remove in part because the ink particles move deeper into the skin over time, the researchers said. And smoking is believed to hinder tattoo removal because smoking is known to hinder wound healing. The researchers also found that the amount of time between QSL treatment sessions was important to the technique's success. Treatment intervals of eight weeks or less were found to be less effective for tattoo removal. A separate study, also published in the Archives of Dermatology, however, suggests a different type of laser currently in development called a picosecond alexandrite laser, can remove tattoos with fewer treatments than the QSL laser. The study involved 15 patients and was partly funded by Cynosure Inc., a Westford, Mass., firm that is waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to clear its picosecond laser for marketing. Most patients could have their tattoos removed with four or fewer treatments, said one of the study's authors, Nazanin Saedi, who was a fellow at SkinCare Physicians in Chestnut Hill, Mass., where the study was conducted. Dr. Saedi is now an assistant professor and director of laser surgery and cosmetic dermatology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

The 30 miles of steep roads that snake through the mountains of Logan Canyon in Utah are enough to make most drivers'hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear River Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Canyon hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine-but the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became. Rounding a sharp U-turn at mile marker473, Andersen saw a truck that had skated off the road and immediately tapped his brakes. In an instant, the car was sliding at 25 miles per hour toward the shoulder of the highway, then rolling down a steep ten-foot dam toward the extremely cold Logan River. As it hit the water, the car tipped toward the passenger side, hesitated, and then rolled onto its roof and sank into the river. There was no time to tell the kids what to do. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the upside-down car was filled with water. \\"It was frightening how fast we were completely underwater,\\"remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken product development manager.\\"You're thinking, is this how it's all going to end?\\" Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids.

That's when he saw a group of men, about ten in all, appear at the top of the dam. One after another, they raced down into the water.

In addition, the weather was fine on that New Year's Eve, which further led Andersen to believe that the drive to the Bear River Mountains would be uneventful. However, despite his familiarity with the road and the seemingly favorable weather conditions, Andersen found that the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became due to ice. This unexpected slipperiness ultimately caused the car accident that led to their vehicle falling into the freezing cold Logan River. As the car rolled into the river, its windows broke, and it was quickly filled with water, endangering Andersen and the three children who were with him: his nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-year-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Fortunately, Andersen was able to think quickly and escape the submerged car, taking a deep breath of air at the surface of the water. Upon seeing a group of about ten men who had appeared at the top of the dam, Andersen was filled with hope as they raced down to assist in the rescue effort. These brave men were able to help Andersen safely retrieve all three children from the submerged vehicle, shouting with concern about who else might still be trapped inside. In this experience, Andersen learned the importance of not being too complacent about road conditions or the risks associated with driving, even on familiar routes and during seemingly good weather.

The answer is:","completion":"\\"Africa\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a continent known to have diverse habitats, including grasslands, savannahs, and jungles, where lions are commonly found. Africa is home to the largest lion population, and these big cats are native to several African countries. The other possible answers provided in the question can be analyzed as follows: 1. Veldt: Veldt, also known as veld, refers to the open grasslands of South Africa, which is an African country. Lions reside in grasslands and savannahs, making the veldt a suitable habitat for lions. However, this answer is region-specific to South Africa, while Africa is broad and encompasses a variety of lion habitats. 2. Ocean: Lions are not aquatic animals and do not live in the ocean. They are terrestrial mammals known for their preference for dry regions and grasslands. 3. Savannah: Savannahs are tropical grasslands with scattered trees, and they are one of the primary habitats where lions are found. The African savannah is particularly famous for its lion population. However, using \\"Africa\\" as the answer would cover other habitats where lions are found in addition to savannahs. 4. Jungle: Lions typically prefer open areas, such as grasslands and savannahs, where they can more easily hunt their prey. However, some lions may inhabit the jungle in West and Central Africa or the forests of the Gir National Park in India, making it another possible answer connected with human common sense. That said, using \\"Africa\\" as the answer still encompasses more habitats, including the jungle. In conclusion, \\"Africa\\" as an answer is aligned with human common sense because it acknowledges the continent's diverse habitats and locations where lions naturally dwell. This answer covers grasslands, savannahs, and jungles within Africa, making it a more comprehensive choice compared to more specific options like veldt or savannah."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: I've got the wind up somehow. Hypothesis: I've got the wind up before the pitch. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must first analyze what the premise and the hypothesis mean. Here, we'll break down the meaning of each and then discuss the relationship between them. Premise: \\"I've got the wind up somehow.\\" In this context, \\"wind up\\" is an idiomatic expression which means to be agitated, anxious, nervous, or worried about something. When someone says they have the wind up \\"somehow,\\" it implies that the cause or the reason for being anxious is not entirely known, or perhaps there are multiple possible causes. This premise focuses on the emotional state of an individual who experiences anxiety or nervousness due to an uncertain situation. Hypothesis: \\"I've got the wind up before the pitch.\\" This hypothesis is introducing a specific scenario in which the speaker is suggesting that their anxiety or nervousness is occurring \\"before the pitch.\\" The phrase \\"the pitch\\" likely refers to an event in a sports context, such as baseball, where a pitcher throws a ball to a batter, or in a broader sense, it could refer to a presentation or proposal made to someone else, such as a sales pitch. In either sense, the emotional state in the hypothesis remains the same. The nervousness or anxiety is being experienced, however, now the cause of that emotional state is identified as occurring before a particular event (\\"the pitch\\"). Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise reveals an emotional state of unease without providing a specific cause or situation. In contrast, the hypothesis provides a specific context concerning when this emotional state occurs. In this case, it is before an event, such as a presentation or a sports match. If we consider the premise as a superset of all possible situations where someone might have the wind up for unknown or uncertain reasons, the hypothesis can be seen as a subset of these situations, referring specifically to the time before a pitch. In other words, the hypothesis is offering a more focused context than that of the premise. However, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is necessarily entailed by the premise. The premise leaves room for various possibilities, whereas the hypothesis presents a specific context. Although the hypothesis could potentially be one example falling within the broader scope of the premise, it cannot be said that the premise necessarily leads to or infers the hypothesis's exact context. In summary, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. While both the premise and the hypothesis explore circumstances in which an individual experiences anxiety, the premise does not provide enough information to determine that the anxiety is occurring before a pitch. The hypothesis, on the other hand, narrows down the context and specifies the situation where the anxiety occurs. So, while the hypothesis may be a valid example of a situation in which someone has \\"the wind up,\\" it is not entirely dictated by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Meghan Keneally PUBLISHED: 14:22 EST, 6 December 2013 | UPDATED: 16:55 EST, 6 December 2013 Bode Miller's wife is now saying that it was 'fate' that she had a miscarriage earlier this year because they wouldn't have been able to spend as much time with his baby from a previous relationship. How much time they are able to spend with the 9-month old is the basis of a contentious custody battle between the Olympian skier and his ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna. McKenna, an ex-marine who moved from California to New York when she was seven months pregnant, was awarded temporary custody of her young son over the Thanksgiving holiday, but now the bitter exes and their legal teams will be back in a Manhattan court next week for the next hearing. That reason is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to Bode's son with OPTIONS: - Bode, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Bode Miller, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - California, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Manhattan, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - McKenna, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Meghan Keneally, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Miller, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Nate vs Sam, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - New York, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Olympian, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Sara McKenna, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. - Thanksgiving, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names.","completion":"- McKenna, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names. The correct answer is \\"McKenna\\" because the sentence refers to Bode Miller's son with his ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna. The reason behind their contention is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to Bode's son with McKenna. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Bode, Bode Miller, Miller, Olympian: These options refer to Bode Miller himself, not his ex-girlfriend (Sara McKenna) with whom he is having a custody battle. - California, Manhattan, New York: These options refer to locations, not the person (Sara McKenna) involved in the custody battle. - Meghan Keneally: This is the name of the author of the article, not relevant to the custody battle. - Nate vs Sam: This option does not relate to any person or fact mentioned in the text. - Thanksgiving: This refers to the holiday mentioned in the text, not the person (Sara McKenna) involved in the custody battle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What did the captain from West Point do as soon as he gets to Furnace Creek? is inside the article: Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame. But the real villain is Leverett, who bribed Walsh and organized the Apache raid. A guilty conscience causes Walsh to write a confession. Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes. Cash gives him the confession and tells him to take it to the Army as proof. Wounded in a gunfight with Leverett but victorious, Cash recovers and reads in the paper about the proof of General Blackwell's innocence., can you guess it ?

Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element. Now answer this question: What are the two dialectical groups of Catalan?","completion":"The Catalan language is divided into two main dialectical groups: Eastern Catalan and Western Catalan. While both groups share a strong lexical unity, they also exhibit some notable differences in word choices. Eastern Catalan primarily includes dialects spoken in the eastern regions of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the Roussillon area of France, while Western Catalan encompasses dialects spoken in the Valencian Community, western parts of Catalonia, and the eastern regions of Aragon. The differences between Eastern and Western Catalan can be attributed to various factors such as historical, geographical, and sociolinguistic influences. Despite these dialectal variations, the two groups still maintain a high level of mutual intelligibility. Within each of these two groups, any lexical divergence can be explained as an archaism, implying that the variations are due to the retention of certain linguistic features from older forms of the language.

He and his gang are particularly upset by the hanging of a friend by Braxton, a land baron who takes the law into his own hands. Logan's men pull off a daring train robbery, only to lose much of the money. They decide to seek vengeance against Braxton by killing his foreman Pete Marker and by buying a small property close to Braxton's ranch, then rustling his stock. First the gang, without Logan, rides off across the Missouri River and north of the border to steal horses belonging to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In their absence, Logan plants crops and enters into a relationship with Braxton's virginal daughter, Jane. Braxton is obsessed with both his rustling problem and his daughter. He sends for Robert E. Lee Clayton, a notorious \\"regulator\\" who, for a price, will take care of rustlers personally. Clayton arrives with a fancy wardrobe, a perfumed scent, an Irish brogue and a Creedmoor rifle (a Model 1859 Sharps rifle) with which he is deadly accurate from a very long distance. Quickly suspicious of Logan, who doesn't strike him as a farmer, Clayton dons a variety of disguises and begins to pick off Logan's gang, one by one. Identifying himself as \\"Jim Ferguson,\\" he kills Logan's young friend Little Tod by dragging him with a rope through the raging Missouri. Clayton spies on Logan with binoculars and taunts Braxton about his daughter's affair with a horse thief. Braxton attempts to discharge him but Clayton is determined to finish what he starts. He amuses himself by shooting two more of Logan's partners, Cary and Cy, from a distance and then by wearing a \\"granny\\" dress while brutally killing Logan's closest friend, Cal, with a handmade weapon. Logan knows it's kill or be killed. He also wants vengeance against Braxton for having hired the regulator in the first place, despite his feelings for Jane. One night after a campfire goes dark with Clayton serenading his horse, Logan slits his throat. He then comes after Braxton, who has lost his mind â...

Q:Given the following context: After several years having focused entirely on his career with the Regional Information Service, Jaojoby was approached in 1987 by Frenchman Pierre Henri Donat to contribute several recordings to Madagascar's first salegy compilation album, Les Grands Maîtres du Salegy (\\"Grand Masters of Salegy\\"). The runaway success of one of the tracks he composed and performed, \\"Samy Mandeha Samy Mitady\\", elevated salegy from a regional genre to one of nationwide popularity, leading a newspaper to declare him the \\"King of Salegy\\". High demand for live performances led the singer to return to Antananarivo in 1988 to form a band named \\"Jaojoby\\" that included former bandmates from Los Matadores and The Players. Jaojoby begin touring regularly at home and abroad, performing his first international concerts in Paris in 1989. In the meantime, he worked as a press attaché for the Ministry of Transport, Meteorology and Tourism from 1990 until 1993, at which point he left his job to become a full-time musician.The 1992 release of Jaojoby's first full-length album, titled Salegy!, was facilitated by fRoots magazine editor Ian Anderson, who had worked with Jaojoby to record several of his tracks for a radio broadcast two years previously. Jaojoby's second album, Velono, was the first salegy album to be recorded in France, as well as the first of his albums to be produced in a professional-quality recording studio. Following the 1994 release of Velono, Jaojoby became a regular on the international music festival circuit and has performed at such events as WOMAD in Reading, the Festival du Bout du Monde in Brittany, WOMEX in Spain, the Festival des Musiques Métisses in Angoulême, the MASA Festival in Abidjan, and similar events in Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Jaojoby's excitement over his rise to international celebrity was attenuated by the 1995 death of the band's original drummer, Jean-Claude Djaonarana, who had first performed with Jaojoby as a member of Los Matadores. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who formed the band named Jaojoby?

When an atom's nucleus has too few or too many neutrons, it becomes unstable, resulting in the atom undergoing radioactive decay. The two main types of decay are alpha decay and beta decay, with each type affecting radioactivity levels differently. When an atom undergoes alpha decay, it releases an alpha particle, consisting of two protons and two neutrons. This event signifies a transformation of the original atom into a different element. Consequently, the release of these subatomic particles increases the radioactivity of the surrounding environment, as well as causes the formation of a new element with a different atomic mass and number. On the other hand, beta decay occurs when a neutron in an unstable nucleus transforms into a proton and an electron. The proton remains within the nucleus, while the electron, also known as a beta particle, is released into the environment. Similar to alpha decay, beta decay leads to an increase in radioactivity levels and the formation of a different element. Supposing that a disturbance occurs in the nuclei of specific atoms, causing them to have an altered balance between protons and neutrons, this, in turn, will impact the rate of radioactive decay that these atoms exhibit. When considering the second effect mentioned, which is the increase in radioactivity levels due to particle emission, the perturbation of the nuclei will likely lead to a quantitative change in the rate of decay. If the perturbation causes the atom to become more unstable, the rate of radioactive decay and consequent radioactivity levels will increase. This is because a higher number of unstable atoms will decay more rapidly, releasing a greater amount of subatomic particles into the environment, thus increasing the radioactivity. Alternatively, if the perturbation somehow restores stability to the nucleus or makes it less prone to decay, the radioactivity levels may decrease or have no effect. In such a case, fewer subatomic particles would be released into the environment, minimizing or stabilizing radioactivity levels. In conclusion, the effect of nuclear perturbations on radioactivity levels depends on the degree and nature of the disturbance. The outcome can lead to an increase, decrease, or have no effect on radioactivity levels, considering the specific conditions of the alteration and the overall stability of the affected atoms."},{"prompt":"Answer the question below: Kathy did some experiments on two different alkanes and one of the alkanes had twice as many carbon atoms than the other.

Input: To study the influence of a linker rigidity and donor-acceptor properties, the P-CH 2 -O-CHR-fragment in acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (e.g., acyclovir, tenofovir) was replaced by the P-CH 2 -HN-C(O)-residue. The respective phosphonates were synthesized in good yields by coupling the straight chain of x-aminophosphonates and nucleobase-derived acetic acids with EDC. Based on the 1 H and 13 C NMR data, the unrestricted rotation within the methylene and 1,2-ethylidene linkers in phosphonates from series a and b was confirmed. For phosphonates containing 1,3-propylidene (series c) fragments, antiperiplanar disposition of the bulky O,O-diethylphosphonate and substituted amidomethyl groups was established.

An illness prevented Merckx from taking part in the Milan-San Remo at the start of the 1973 calendar. During a span of nineteen days, Merckx won four classics including Omloop Het Volk, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, and Paris-Roubaix. He decided to race the Vuelta a Espana and the Giro d'Italia, instead of racing the Tour de France. He won the opening prologue of the Vuelta to take an early lead. Despite Ocana's best efforts, Merckx won a total of six stages on his way to his only Vuelta a Espana title. In addition to the general classification, Merckx won the race's points classification and combination classifications. Four days after the conclusion of the Vuelta, Merckx lined up to start the Giro d'Italia. He won the opening two-man time trial with Roger Swerts and the next day's leg as well. Merckx's primary competitor, Fuente, lost a significant amount of time during the second stage. He won eighth stage that featured a summit finish to Monte Carpegna despite Fuente attacking several times on the ascent. Fuente tried attacking throughout the race of the race, but was only able to make time gains on the race's penultimate stage. Merckx won the race after leading from start to finish, a feat only previously done by Alfredo Binda and Costante Girardengo. He also became the first rider to win the Giro and Vuelta in the same calendar year. The UCI Road World Championships were held in Barcelona, Spain in 1973 and contested on the Montjuich circuit. During the road race, Merckx attacked with around one hundred kilometers left. His move was marked by Freddy Maertens, Gimondi, and Ocana. Merckx attacked on the final lap, but was reeled in by the three riders. It came down to a sprint between the four, of which Merckx came in last and Gimondi in first. Following the road race, Merckx won his first Paris-Brussels and Grand Prix des Nations.

But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision.

The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln to a tee, one of his best roles. The film concerns two young men, brothers, on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed. In classic angry mob style, the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them, until honest Abe steps into the fray.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Idea of New Attention Disorder Spurs Research, and Debate With more than six million American children having received a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, concern has been rising that the condition is being significantly misdiagnosed and overtreated with prescription medications. Yet now some powerful figures in mental health are claiming to have identified a new disorder that could vastly expand the ranks of young people treated for attention problems. Called sluggish cognitive tempo, the condition is said to be characterized by lethargy, daydreaming and slow mental processing. By some researchers’ estimates, it is present in perhaps two million children. Experts pushing for more research into sluggish cognitive tempo say it is gaining momentum toward recognition as a legitimate disorder — and, as such, a candidate for pharmacological treatment. Some of the condition’s researchers have helped Eli Lilly investigate how its flagship A.D.H.D. drug might treat it. The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology devoted 136 pages of its January issue to papers describing the illness, with the lead paper claiming that the question of its existence “seems to be laid to rest as of this issue.” The psychologist Russell Barkley of the Medical University of South Carolina, for 30 years one of A.D.H.D.’s most influential and visible proponents, has claimed in research papers and lectures that sluggish cognitive tempo “has become the new attention disorder.” In an interview, Keith McBurnett, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and co-author of several papers on sluggish cognitive tempo, said: “When you start talking about things like daydreaming, mind-wandering, those types of behaviors, someone who has a son or daughter who does this excessively says, ‘I know about this from my own experience.’ They know what you’re talking about.” Yet some experts, including Dr. McBurnett and some members of the journal’s editorial board, say that there is no consensus on the new disorder’s specific symptoms, let alone scientific validity. They warn that the concept’s promotion without vastly more scientific rigor could expose children to unwarranted diagnoses and prescription medications — problems that A.D.H.D. already faces. “We’re seeing a fad in evolution: Just as A.D.H.D. has been the diagnosis du jour for 15 years or so, this is the beginning of another,” said Dr. Allen Frances, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke University. “This is a public health experiment on millions of kids.” Though the concept of sluggish cognitive tempo, or S.C.T., has been researched sporadically since the 1980s, it has never been recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which codifies conditions recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. The editor in chief of The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, Charlotte Johnston, said in an email that recent renewed interest in the condition is what led the journal to devote most of one issue to “highlight areas in which further study is needed.” Dr. Barkley declined repeated requests for interviews about his work and statements regarding sluggish cognitive tempo. Several of the field’s other key researchers, Stephen P. Becker of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Benjamin B. Lahey of the University of Chicago and Stephen A. Marshall of Ohio University, also declined to comment on their work. Papers have proposed that a recognition of sluggish cognitive tempo could help resolve some longstanding confusion about A.D.H.D., which despite having hyperactivity in its name includes about two million children who are not hyperactive, merely inattentive. Some researchers propose that about half of those children would be better classified as having sluggish cognitive tempo, with perhaps one million additional children, who do not meet A.D.H.D.’s criteria now, having the new disorder, too. “These children are not the ones giving adults much trouble, so they’re easy to miss,” Dr. McBurnett said. “They’re the daydreamy ones, the ones with work that’s not turned in, leaving names off of papers or skipping questions, things like that, that impinge on grades or performance. So anything we can do to understand what’s going on with these kids is a good thing.” But Dr. McBurnett added that sluggish cognitive tempo remained many years from any scientific consensus: “We haven’t even agreed on the symptom list — that’s how early on we are in the process.” Steve S. Lee, an associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who serves on the editorial board of The Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, said in an interview that he was conflicted over the journal’s emphasis on sluggish cognitive tempo. He expressed concern that A.D.H.D. had already grown to encompass too many children with common youthful behavior, or whose problems are derived not from a neurological disorder but from inadequate sleep, a different learning disability or other sources. About two-thirds of children with an A.D.H.D. diagnosis take daily medication such as Adderall or Concerta, which often quells severe impulsiveness and inattention but also carries risks for insomnia, appetite suppression and, among teenagers and adults, abuse or addiction. “The scientist part of me says we need to pursue knowledge, but we know that people will start saying their kids have it, and doctors will start diagnosing it and prescribing for it long before we know whether it’s real,” Dr. Lee said. “A.D.H.D. has become a public health, societal question, and it’s a fair question to ask of S.C.T. We better pump the brakes more diligently.” Dr. McBurnett recently conducted a clinical trial funded and overseen by Eli Lilly that investigated whether proposed symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo could be treated with Strattera, the company’s primary A.D.H.D. drug. (One of Strattera’s selling points is that it is not a stimulant like Adderall and Concerta, medications more susceptible to abuse.) His study, published in The Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, concluded, “This is the first study to report significant effects of any medication on S.C.T.” An Eli Lilly spokeswoman said in an email, “Sluggish cognitive tempo is one of many conditions that Lilly scientists continue to study to help satisfy unmet medical needs around the world.” Representatives of the drug companies that make the best-selling medications for A.D.H.D. — Shire (extended-release Adderall and Vyvanse), Novartis (Focalin) and Janssen (Concerta) — said they are not currently conducting research into sluggish cognitive tempo. However, because the new condition shares so many symptoms with A.D.H.D., these products might easily be repositioned to serve the new market. Dr. Barkley, who has said that “S.C.T. is a newly recognized disorder,” also has financial ties to Eli Lilly; he received 118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements, according to propublica.org. While detailing sluggish cognitive tempo in The Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Dr. Barkley stated that Strattera’s performance on sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms was “an exciting finding.” Dr. Barkley has also published a symptom checklist for mental health professionals to identify adults with the condition; the forms are available for 131.75 apiece from Guilford Press, which funds some of his research. Dr. Barkley, who edits sluggish cognitive tempo’s Wikipedia page, declined a request to discuss his financial interests in the condition’s acceptance. “I have no doubt there are kids who meet the criteria for this thing, but nothing is more irrelevant,” Dr. Frances said. “The enthusiasts here are thinking of missed patients. What about the mislabeled kids who are called patients when there’s nothing wrong with them? They are not considering what is happening in the real world.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of one of the researchers of sluggish cognitive tempo. He is Stephen P. Becker, not Steven. In addition, the article misstated the institution with which another researcher, Stephen A. Marshall, is affiliated. It is Ohio University, not Miami University in Ohio.

The Persian Wars (also known as Greco-Persian Wars) were a series of wars fought between the Persian Empire and the Greek city-states primarily in the 5th century BC (499-449 BC).

Write an article with the title: \\"CIA torture architect breaks silence to defend 'enhanced interrogation'\\" Article:","completion":"Title: CIA Torture Architect Breaks Silence to Defend 'Enhanced Interrogation' Introduction: In a surprising move, the architect behind the CIA's notorious torture program, known as \\"enhanced interrogation,\\" has come forward to defend the controversial practices that were implemented during the post-9/11 era. This marks the first time that a high-ranking official from the intelligence community has spoken publicly about the morally contentious techniques, including waterboarding, stress positions, and sleep deprivation. Step 1 - Present the subject's key points: Dr. James Mitchell, a retired Air Force psychologist and contractor for the CIA, has recently broken his silence to justify the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. In his defense, Dr. Mitchell claims that the methods were necessary to extract vital information from high-profile terrorists, ultimately leading to the prevention of further attacks on American soil. He also emphasizes that the tactics were legal and authorized by government officials, although acknowledging the discomfort involved for detainees. Step 2 - Delve into the background of the enhanced interrogation program: The CIA initiated the enhanced interrogation program soon after the 9/11 attacks, under the Bush administration. It continued until 2009, during which time several captured terrorists, such as Kahlid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind behind the attacks, were subjected to these controversial methods. These tactics have been widely criticized due to their inhumane nature and have caused significant damage to America's global standing and reputation. Step 3 - Highlight the key criticisms of the program: Human rights organizations, members of Congress, and the international community have heavily criticized the CIA's enhanced interrogation program. They argue that the tactics utilized amount to torture, which violates both U.S. and international law. Critics also point out the methods' lack of effectiveness, citing instances where detainees provided false or already accessible information under duress, leading to wasted resources and misguided intelligence actions. Step 4 - Include Dr. Mitchell's counterarguments: Dr. Mitchell rebuts the criticism by stating that the enhanced interrogation program did, in fact, yield valuable information that would not have been obtained otherwise. He insists that the discomfort experienced by detainees during the process was carefully calibrated to leave no long-term physical or psychological harm. Mitchell also cites the urgency of the post-9/11 environment, suggesting that unconventional methods like waterboarding were necessary under such extraordinary circumstances. Step 5 - Discuss current perspectives and ongoing debate: While President Obama officially put an end to the enhanced interrogation program in 2009, the debate surrounding its moral and legal implications remains heated. Both the U.S. government and the CIA have continued to grapple with the challenging legacy of the era. Dr. Mitchell's decision to defend the program publicly adds another dimension to the conversation and raises new questions about the ethical boundaries of national security measures. Conclusion: Dr. James Mitchell's public defense of the CIA's enhanced interrogation program has reignited the debate regarding the delicate balance between national security and adherence to ethical standards. As the world faces new and evolving threats, it's crucial to develop effective strategies that protect not only the physical safety of citizens but also the foundational principles that underpin democratic societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A baby shower is a party where a pregnant woman is \\"showered\\" with gifts and good wishes. A baby shower is usually given by a close female friend or a relative of the mother-to-be. Sometimes co-workers of a pregnant person will also hold a baby shower for her. The baby shower is usually given when the mother-to-be is between 6 and 9 months pregnant. _ the date of a baby's birth isn't always exact. Sometimes a baby shower can also happen after the baby is born. A baby shower can be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or a catering hall. Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby showers are also including the father-to-be. Like a bridal shower, a mother-to-be will register a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list usually includes things the mother wants for her baby like clothes, diapers and even furniture. This way friends and family members can go to the stores and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15. At a baby shower, people can give cards with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most of these cards also include money or gift cards to help the mom-to-be buy whatever else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games as well. In one game everyone guesses the date of the baby. Another game lets people taste baby food and guess the flavor.

News article: The NFL preseason matters a little more than you think It’s the eternal question: How much does the NFL preseason really matter? No one looks at spring training as a harbinger of things to come in the baseball season. Few even know the NBA or NHL preseason exists (legend has it that the latter starts a few days after the end of the Stanley Cup Finals). But football fans, always looking for some clue to the future successes of their teams, try and glean some information from the silly season in August, when the stars usually sit and benchwarmers dominate. We know we shouldn’t. We say it’s meaningless, yet every season we try to convince ourself that it does. If a team goes 4-0, that momentum might carry them into the regular season. If they’re 0-4, then preseason doesn’t matter at all, and you’ll rattle off the records of some of the all-time great teams who didn’t win in preseason (e.g. the 1991 Washington Redskins, who went 17-2 after an ugly 1-3 preseason). But what’s the real answer? FTW looked at five years at data to find out that, surprisingly, you can find a little information about how a team will fare based on its preseason record. But only a little and only if you look real hard. Granted, this is only five years of data with about 160 preseason wins and losses and 60 playoff teams, so it’s hardly gospel, but it does provide an interesting look into how the exhibition season can lead to the extra season in January. There’s nothing in the numbers to ensure or remove playoff chances for teams based on preseason records. But teams that make the playoffs actually do tend to have better preseason records than teams that don’t. In the past five years, 75% of playoff teams have had two wins or more. Only 25% have had zero or one wins in the preseason. That’s a pretty startling statistic for a group of “meaningless” games. But that’s only half the question. We can’t just look at how many 2-2 or 3-1 playoff teams made the postseason, but how many didn’t. That leads us to our next chart. In it, we look at the collective preseason win totals of teams from 2010-2014. The X-axis represents the number of wins each NFL team had in that specific preseason. (For example, in 2010, two teams had zero wins in the preseason, six teams had one win, 14 teams had two wins, nine teams had three wins, four teams had one win, and so on throughout each year. Note: In one year, the New York Giants won five games. Their total has been knocked down to four in these numbers.) This is where it gets slightly more interesting. While getting two or more wins is still the best path to the playoffs, your percentage of making the playoffs with a given record barely changes. You’re actually more likely to get in with an 0-4 record than a 4-0 record. In the chart above, for instance, a team had about a 40% chance of making the playoffs by going 0-4, 2-2, 3-1 or 4-0. Those percentages all hovered around 40%, which is, not surprisingly, how many teams get into the playoffs in a given year. So even though more teams disproportionately make it with 2-4 wins (that number would be 60% in everything were equal, it’s 75% instead), 40% of teams with an 0-4 mark are still making it in. The reason more teams in the playoffs have 2+ wins is because that’s what most teams have in the preseason. The outlier is 1-3, in which only 28% of teams make the playoffs, something I imagine would revert closer to the mean if we used a larger sample size. Okay, now that we’ve gone way too deep into preseason football, what does it all mean? Basically, it’s better to go 2-2 than it is to go 0-4, but the percentage of teams making the playoffs with a specific preseason record is the same across the spectrum. But, really, last year’s NFC East is a perfect example of what can be the utter meaningless and randomness of preseason games. The New York Giants went a perfect 5-0, then only went 6-10 in the regular season. Washington went 3-1, then only managed four wins in the regular season. Meanwhile, Dallas was 0-4 in exhibition games and went on to go 12-4 and came within a catch of going to the NFC championship. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1. The NFL preseason has often been considered as less relevant in determining a team's success during the regular season, but recent data analysis shows it might be more significant than previously thought. 2. A study looking at five years of data found that 75% of playoff teams achieved at least two preseason wins, while only 25% had zero or one win. 3. Although 2+ preseason wins are more common among playoff teams, the percentage of teams making the playoffs with a specific preseason record (0-4, 2-2, 3-1, or 4-0) is roughly the same across the board, around 40%. 4. Last year's NFC East division showcased the potential randomness and lack of correlation between preseason and regular-season success, with the New York Giants having a perfect preseason but underperforming in the regular season, while the Dallas Cowboys had a poor preseason yet excelled in the regular season. 5. The findings suggest that while preseason records don't guarantee playoff chances, there is a slightly higher likelihood for teams with better preseason performances to make the playoffs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","completion":"In May 2006, the European Union suspended negotiations for the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with Belgrade, citing the lack of cooperation of the Serbs with the United Nations Tribunal. To provide more context on this issue, the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) is a type of agreement that the European Union (EU) enters into with countries from the Western Balkans, including Serbia, as a framework for cooperation and preparation for their future integration into the EU. These agreements cover various areas, such as political dialogue, trade, and legislative approximation, aiming to harmonize the legal frameworks of the aspiring country with that of the EU. Serbia's cooperation, or lack thereof, with the United Nations (UN) International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was a crucial aspect of its progress toward EU integration. The ICTY was established in 1993 to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the wars in the former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 2001. During the 1990s, Serbia was involved in a series of conflicts, including the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. The EU wanted Serbia to cooperate fully with the ICTY to ensure that individuals responsible for war crimes would be held accountable and that justice would be served. In May 2006, due to Serbia's lack of cooperation with the ICTY, specifically their inability or unwillingness to apprehend and transfer suspects to The Hague, the EU decided to suspend their negotiations for the Stabilization and Association Agreement. This move was intended to send a strong message to Serbia, emphasizing that full cooperation with the ICTY is a prerequisite for further EU integration. This suspension also aimed to encourage Serbia to enhance its efforts to capture war crime fugitives and cooperate with the international tribunal more effectively. Over the years, Serbia's relations with the EU have evolved, but cooperation with the ICTY and dealing with the legacy of its past conflicts remain critical factors in Serbia's path to EU integration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chesley Sullenberger was born in Denison, Texas, His father was a descendant of Swiss-German immigrants named Sullenberger. He has one sister, Mary. The street on which he grew up in Denison was named after his mother's family. According to his sister, Sullenberger built model planes and aircraft carriers during his childhood, and says he became interested in flying after seeing military jets from an Air Force base near his house. Sullenberger was appointed to the United States Air Force Academy, entering with the Class of 1973 in June 1969. He was selected along with around a dozen other freshmen for a cadet glider program, and by the end of that year, he was an instructor pilot. In the year of his graduation, 1973, he received the Outstanding Cadet in Airmanship award, as the class \\"top flyer\\". Following graduation with a Bachelor of Science and his commissioning as an officer, the Air Force immediately sent Sullenberger to Purdue University to pursue a master's degree prior to entering Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT). Following completion of his graduate degree at Purdue, he was assigned to UPT at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, flying the T-37 Tweet and T-38 Talon. After earning his wings in 1975 as a USAF Pilot, he completed replacement training in the F-4 Phantom II at Luke AFB, Arizona. This was followed by his assignment to the 493d Tactical Fighter Squadron of 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, where he flew as a United States Air Force fighter pilot in the F-4D Phantom II. Following his assignment at RAF Lakenheath, he was reassigned to the 428th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing at Nellis AFB, Nevada, again flying the F-4D. He advanced to become a flight leader and a training officer, and attained the rank of captain, with experience in Europe, the Pacific, and at Nellis Air Force Base, as well as operating as Blue Force Mission Commander in Red Flag Exercises.

Obviously he will rotate out at some point, but that point has not yet been determined and it will not occur anytime soon. Until then, he will continue to ably lead our coalition forces in Afghanistan. General David Petraeus is expected to leave his post as commander of United States troops in Afghanistan, the Times Of London reports early Tuesday evening. The Washington Post reported earlier in the day: No final decisions have been made, but military officials said that Petraeus, who took command last July, will rotate out of Afghanistan before the end of the year. The general who replaces Petraeus will have to navigate a tricky relationship with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani leaders... According to the Times, the Pentagon is expected to name a replacement for Petraeus by the end of the year. President Barack Obama tapped Petraeus to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal last summer after controversy swirling around critical comments the then-commander made about Obama administration officials to Rolling Stone landed him out of his post. Reuters reports: Petraeus has been talked about for a while as a possible successor to Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), who is expected to retire in October. Any move would be part of a broader shake-up in the administration, which will also see Defense Secretary Robert Gates retire this year. ... His departure, especially with Gates on his way out, could create the space for Obama to recalibrate Afghan strategy, backing away from the military surge and focusing more on a political settlement - if he wants to do so. The Post notes that Petraeus is not the only leading U.S. official in Afghanistan expected to rotate out of his post this year. Among others, U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry, who has expressed reservations about the country's Afghan war strategy, will reportedly leave his job in coming months. The Times reports: It forms part of a sweeping reorganisation of top American officials in Afghanistan, which the Obama Administration hopes to present as proof that its strategy does not depend on the towering reputation of one man. ||||| The Pentagon has denied that the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, is planning to quit by the end of the year. The Times reported that the Pentagon was looking to replace Petraeus, who was appointed eight months ago. But the Pentagon said that while it constantly reviewed rotations, particularly as a number of senior posts were about to fall vacant, no decision had been made about Petraeus. Petraeus is popular in the US, credited with first turning around Iraq and now, as head of Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf), helping to reverse Taliban gains in southern Afghanistan and bring a degree of stability. Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon spokesman, said: \\"Despite some sensational speculation by one of the London papers, I can assure you General Petraeus is not quitting as Isaf commander, but nor does he plan to stay in Afghanistan for ever. \\"Obviously he will rotate out at some point, but that point has not yet been determined and it will not occur any time soon. Until then, he will continue to ably lead our coalition forces in Afghanistan.\\" By the end of the year, Petraeus will have done 18 months, a normal rotation for the post, and he would be in the running for a more senior post back in the US. US forces are due to begin a drawdown in July but Petraeus will fight to keep as many as possible in Afghanistan to try to pacify the country, in a repeat of the strategy he used in Iraq. He might then ask to stay into next year. Petraeus has been touted as a possible Republican presidential candidate to take on President Barack Obama for the White House next year, but has repeatedly denied he is planning to run. ||||| A:","completion":"Part #1: Summarizing text with multiple news articles separated by special token \\"|||||\\".

Syria's head of antiquities had suggested on Monday that the Temple of Bel was still standing, despite reports of a massive explosion at the weekend. But Unosat analysts said the main structure had been reduced to rubble, as well as a line of columns beside it. IS captured the Unesco World Heritage site from government forces in May. \\"Unfortunately, the images we acquired do show that the main building of the temple has been destroyed,\\" Einar Bjorgo, Unosat's manager, told the BBC early on Tuesday. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) considered the Temple of Bel - the great sanctuary of the Palmyrene gods - one of the most important religious buildings of the 1st Century AD in the East. Maamoun Abdul Karim, the head of the Syrian Department of Antiquities and Museums, said its destruction was a \\"catastrophe\\". \\"I feel very sad and I am very pessimistic... for the future of Palmyra,\\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"I am sure we will have more bad images [in the future] because these people... are ignorant, they are very criminal,\\" he added. \\"They don't respect any image, any identity of the people.\\" IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' History's lesson in how to save artefacts Understanding sadness at loss of sites Why IS destroys ancient sites Mr Abdul Karim had said on Monday that there was a large explosion at the Temple of Bel, but that he believed most of the site remained intact. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the temple is bounded by a high perimeter wall, and the whole sprawling site of Palmyra is controlled by IS, so it would have been hard for outside witnesses on the ground to verify what had happened without putting themselves at risk. IS has ransacked and demolished several similar ancient sites that pre-date Islam in Iraq, denouncing them as symbols of \\"idolatry\\". The sale of looted antiquities is nevertheless one of the group's main sources of funding. It has also been accused of destroying ancient sites to gain publicity. Authorities removed hundreds of statues and priceless objects before IS overran Palmyra earlier this year. Last week, it was confirmed that another important site at Palmyra, the Temple of Baalshamin, had been blown up. Unosat released satellite images showing the extent of the damage, proving that parts were heavily damaged or completely destroyed. Earlier last month, the group beheaded 81-year-old Khaled al-Asaad, the archaeologist who had looked after the Palmyra ruins for 40 years. The world-famous Greco-Roman ruins of Palmyra are in the desert north-east of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Syrian government forces have sought to drive IS out of the Palmyra area in recent months and there has been fierce fighting in nearby towns.

The temple was considered a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most important religious buildings of the 1st Century AD in the East. The destruction of the Temple of Bel has been referred to as a \\"catastrophe\\" and raises concerns about the future of other historical sites in Palmyra that are under threat from ISIS. The terrorist group has demolished several other ancient sites in the past, claiming them to be symbols of \\"idolatry,\\" while also profiting from the sale of looted antiquities.

I was walking through the house one morning and suddenly I could see NOTHING out of one eye. When I told my husband,who was right there when it happened, he assumed my eye was just blurry or something had gotten in the eye. He took me to the ophthalmologist who verified that I could not see out of the eye. Then we subsequently got the worse news that it was a neurological condition with a long name I do not remember that there was nothing he could do about. He said that I would either get my sight back or I you and all we could do was wait and see if it came back. This was right before finals that semester but he told me I absolutely could not be studying or using my good eye for reading or basically anything that would strain it or I could end up losing sight in that eye also. Needless to say, as a mom of two children ages 2 1/2 and 6 months,I could not afford to lose ALL of my sight! So, I had to wait. I could not drive like that either which made matters worse. Both my husband and I were in school fulltime (until then), fortunately it was the end of the semester, unfortunately it was BEFORE finals. My sight did come back but not for about 5 months. When it first started to come back I still couldn't drive because although I could see I did not have my peripheral vision, that did not fully come back for quite a while.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The following article contains an answer for the question: What two brands of amplifiers do grunge guitarists use? , can you please find it? Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". Answer:","completion":"Grunge guitarists typically use Marshall and Mesa-Boogie amplifiers. Marshall amplifiers are known for their loudness and powerful sound, while Mesa-Boogie amplifiers have been used by notable grunge musicians such as Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl in early Foo Fighters songs.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If less water becomes a gas due to the perturbation, it may affect the efficiency of the salt removal process. The direct effect will be that a smaller amount of water will be available to condense into the second container, resulting in a lesser quantity of fresh water produced. Indirectly, this could also lead to a higher concentration of salt in the first container as less water has evaporated. However, this does not necessarily mean that more salt will be removed overall. Since the salt particles are not affected by the rate of evaporation, their amount remains the same.

It has two separate regions, the cochlea and the vestibule, which are responsible for hearing and balance, respectively. The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem through separate fiber bundles. However, these two distinct bundles travel together from the inner ear to the brain stem as the vestibulocochlear nerve. Sound is transduced into neural signals within the cochlear region of the inner ear, which contains the sensory neurons of the spiral ganglia. These ganglia are located within the spiral-shaped cochlea of the inner ear. The cochlea is attached to the stapes through the oval window. The oval window is located at the beginning of a fluid-filled tube within the cochlea called the scala vestibuli. The scala vestibuli extends from the oval window, travelling above the cochlear duct, which is the central cavity of the cochlea that contains the sound-transducing neurons. At the uppermost tip of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli curves over the top of the cochlear duct. The fluid-filled tube, now called the scala tympani, returns to the base of the cochlea, this time travelling under the cochlear duct. The scala tympani ends at the round window, which is covered by a membrane that contains the fluid within the scala. As vibrations of the ossicles travel through the oval window, the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani moves in a wave-like motion. The frequency of the fluid waves match the frequencies of the sound waves (Figure 14.6). The membrane covering the round window will bulge out or pucker in with the movement of the fluid within the scala tympani. Q: What part of the ear is often described as a bony labyrinth?

Generate a question that has the following answer: Matthew. for the following movie plot: After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the \\"virgin vault\\"), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morningâstill in the elevatorâhe finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.[1] On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault. After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match. When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as \\"Jane-ites\\", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the \\"bra matching the panties\\", and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to the \\"penile power\\", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size. He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias. Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, \\"male make-up\\", and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick.

Using compost, pour the compost over the garden bed until it looks slightly raised.. (B). Using sand, pour the sand over the garden bed until it looks slightly raised..","completion":"To fill garden beds, you have two options as mentioned - using compost or using sand. Below are detailed methods on how to accomplish filling your garden beds using both of these methods. Option A: Using Compost Compost is a great way to fill garden beds as it not only adds nutrients to the soil, but also improves its structure and water retention capabilities. Here's a step-by-step guide to filling garden beds using compost: 1. Measure the area: Measure the length, width and depth of your garden bed to determine the amount of compost you will need to fill it. Generally, a depth of 2-4 inches is recommended, depending on the type of plants you will be growing. 2. Obtain compost: Purchase enough compost to fill the garden bed or make use of homemade compost from your backyard compost bin. 3. Check quality of compost: Make sure that the compost you are planning to use is well-rotted and free of weed seeds or harmful pathogens. Good compost should have an earthy smell, dark brown color and rich, crumbly texture. 4. Prepare the garden bed: Remove any cover material, such as mulch or leaves, and weed the area. Loosen the soil surface with a garden fork or trowel. If your soil needs additional nutrients, consider adding well-rotted manure or other organic matter. 5. Spread the compost: Pour the compost over the garden bed and spread it evenly across the surface using a rake or your hands. Aim for an even layer and make sure to cover the entire bed, leaving no gaps. 6. Mix the compost with the topsoil: Using a garden fork or shovel, mix the compost into the top layer of soil to blend them together. This step helps in better integration of compost with the existing soil structure. 7. Water the garden bed: Moistening the soil after filling the garden bed helps to settle the soil, while providing a good growing environment for your plants. 8. Once filled, you can plant your seeds or transplants in the newly enriched soil and watch your garden thrive. Option B: Using Sand Sand can also be used to fill garden beds, particularly if you want to improve soil drainage or create a specific type of environment for your plants. Follow these steps to fill garden beds using sand: 1. Measure the area: Determine the amount of sand needed to fill the garden bed based on its length, width, and depth. 2. Acquire the sand: Purchase the appropriate amount of horticultural sand from a garden center. Avoid using beach or playground sand as it may contain harmful salts or contaminants. 3. Prepare the garden bed: Remove any cover material and weeds, just as you would when using compost. If you're amending an existing bed, loosen the soil surface with a fork or trowel. 4. Add the sand: Pour the sand over the garden bed and spread it evenly across the surface using a rake or your hands. Distribute the sand so that no spots remain uncovered. 5. Mix sand with the topsoil: Incorporate the sand into the existing soil using a garden fork, shovel, or rototiller. This will help prevent the formation of distinct layers and ensure that both materials are well-integrated for better drainage. 6. Evaluate the mixture: Assess the soil mixture in the garden-bed to confirm it has the proper composition for your plants or has an ideal drainage capacity. Adjust the proportion of sand or other amendments if necessary. 7. Water the garden bed: Moisten the soil after filling the garden bed to help settle it and provide a suitable environment for plant growth. 8. Plant your seeds or transplants in the updated soil. In conclusion, choosing either option A or B to fill your garden beds depends on your specific needs, available resources, and the type of plants you plan to grow. Each method offers its own benefits, and you can customize these approaches to support your unique gardening goals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: St Kilda (Scottish Gaelic: Hiort) is an isolated archipelago situated 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of North Uist, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities.... answer the following question: What archipelago has the highest sea cliffs in the United Kingdom.

The demonstration is certain to be the largest of dozens taking place around the country against Walker and other Republican governors who have taken similar stands against their public employee unions. The progressive group MoveOn.org said it would hold \\"Save the American Dream\\" rallies in all 50 states, including one that drew hundreds of people to Dupont Circle in the District on Saturday afternoon. Although unions have offered concessions they say would close the state's budget gap, Walker remained determined to achieve a resolution that he said would give state and local governments leverage to limit employee costs well into the future. Without legislation to pare back employee health-care and pension benefits while repealing most collective bargaining rights for many public employees, Walker said, he would be forced to make cuts elsewhere in the budget that could lead to massive numbers of state and local employees losing their jobs. \\"If we want to avoid the layoffs that will eventually come at the state and local level, the only way to achieve that\\" is to pass the bill, Walker said. The layoffs would mark an escalation of a battle that has paralyzed the state Capitol. Fourteen Democratic state senators have fled Wisconsin to prevent the state Senate from having a quorum for considering the measure. Walker backed off earlier remarks that the layoffs would begin this week. Nationally, Walker's efforts to break the power of public service unions - being replicated to some degree in several other Republican-led states - have thrown public employee unions into an existential crisis. As a group, public employees generally earn less than comparably educated private-sector employees, but they tend to enjoy far better health-care and retirement benefits. The issue of their compensation has gained particular resonance at a time when states and municipalities across the country are struggling with huge budget deficits and ballooning costs for employees' health-care and pension obligations. The controversy has lifted Walker to national prominence, and he says he is determined to make Wisconsin a leader in remaking the way state and local governments deal with their employees. The clashes over public employee unions continued in other state capitals. In Indianapolis, hundreds of union supporters demonstrated at an otherwise quiet statehouse Friday as there appeared to be no end in sight to a partisan standoff that has paralyzed the legislature. \\"I'm here to help save the jobs of thousands of hardworking Hoosiers,\\" said Jim Szucs, a Teamster from South Bend, Ind. ||||| Police: No more sleeping bags in the Wis. Capitol MADISON, Wis.  Police officers handed out fliers Friday saying they plan to restrict access to the Capitol as protesters geared up for another round of weekend demonstrations over the state budget battle. Police told protesters who have been camping inside the Capitol building for eight days that they will begin collecting sleeping bags, coolers and folding chairs in an effort to return the Capitol to normal business hours Sunday night. \\"We are closing the Capitol for a short period of time for public health reasons, as well as for general building maintenance,\\" Chief Charles Tubbs of the Wisconsin Capitol Police said in a statement issued late Friday. \\"Everyone agrees that our State Capitol is a source of pride for our state and that we should take a break to take care of the building.\\" Protesters who have lived there for several days say they¹re prepared to stage non-violent resistance if police try to clear them out. Bridget Peterson of Duluth, Minn., has been camping inside the Capitol for eight days. \\"People are going to want to fight this somehow even if we lose this space,\\" she said. Republicans in the Wisconsin Assembly took the first significant action on Gov. Scott Walker's plan to strip collective bargaining rights from most public workers, abruptly passing the measure early Friday morning. The vote ended three straight days of punishing debate in the Assembly, but the fight is far from over. Senate Democrats who have fled to Illinois to prevent a vote in that chamber say they won't return unless Walker agrees to discuss a compromise. By Scott Olson, Getty Images Hundreds of people have been living in Wisconsin's Capitol 24 hours a day to protest the governor's budget plans. On Friday, Walker didn't sound conciliatory. During an afternoon appearance in Green Bay, he said, although \\"we got to find a way to make it comfortable for those 14 senators to come back home,\\" Republicans had no intention of backing off the main tenets of the bill. Walker's plan contains a number of provisions that he says are designed to fill the state's 137 million deficit, including requiring public workers to contribute more to their pensions and health insurance and strip them of their right to collectively bargain benefits and work conditions. Tens of thousands of people have jammed the Capitol since last week to protest, pounding on drums and chanting so loudly that police providing security have resorted to earplugs. Hundreds of people have been living in the building 24 hours a day to protest the plan. Demonstrators dragged in air mattresses and blankets and sleep on the building's marble floors between never-ending rounds of chants, marches and drum circles. The scene inside resembles a small village with stands and food stations. Police began circulating the fliers that outline the crackdown Friday morning. In a statement, Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, asked the governor to keep the building open. \\"The law enforcement officers from across the state that have been working at the Capitol have been very impressed with how peaceful everyone has been,\\" Palmer said. He called on police officers to join the sleep-in at the Capitol. Protesters plan to go ahead with a rally scheduled for Saturday. Demonstrators have been conducting non-violent civil disobedience training to plan for the day when the Capitol is cleared. While some activists said Friday that they will leave willingly if asked, many others say they will have to be carried out. \\"You can't carry out 2,000 people,\\" said Will Adams, a student from Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. \\"Or maybe you can.\\" Numerous signs hung by activists remind demonstrators that \\"this is a peaceful protest.\\" Peterson said demonstrators and police have not had any problems so far. She said she thinks everyone is cool-headed enough to keep things non-violent no matter what the authorities do. \\"I really, really hope so,\\" she said.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Problem: Solve 0 = 5*a + 13*a - a - 17 for a. And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = 5*a + 13*a - a - 17 for a, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The left side of the equation already has a 0, so we don't need to modify it. On the right side of the equation, combine the terms related to 'a': 5*a + 13*a - a = (5 + 13 - 1)*a = 17*a Thus, the simplified equation is: 0 = 17*a - 17 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'a'. To find the value of 'a', isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to eliminate the -17 from the right side of the equation. To eliminate -17, add 17 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 17 = 17*a - 17 + 17 Which simplifies to: 17 = 17*a Step 3: Solve for the variable 'a'. Now that we have the simplified equation, 17 = 17*a, proceed to solve for the value of 'a'. Since 17*a means 17 multiplied by 'a', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 17 to find the value of 'a': 17 / 17 = (17*a) / 17 This simplifies to: 1 = a So, the solution to the equation 0 = 5*a + 13*a - a - 17 is a = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first part, \\"death to smoochy is often very funny,\\" is clearly positive, as the author praises the humor of the subject, indicating that they enjoy the material and find it genuinely amusing. This part of the sentence is likely to make the reader look forward to watching the movie, as the emphasis on humor implies that it is entertaining and engaging. The second part of the sentence, \\"but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision,\\" offers a more complex evaluation. On one hand, it can be seen as positive-negative, as it acknowledges the negative or darker aspect of the subject - the \\"misanthropic vision\\" of the creator. Misanthropy usually refers to a general dislike of humanity or being pessimistic about human nature, and such a theme is often considered negative or unappealing. However, it is important to note that the author uses the word \\"remarkable\\" to describe the \\"integrity\\" of this vision. This implies that the author appreciates and admires how well the creator has maintained and expressed their misanthropic perspective throughout the film. In this respect, this part of the sentence can also be seen as a positive evaluation of the creator's artistic consistency and the coherence of the work's thematic elements. Altogether, the sentiment of the sentence is perceived as a balance of positive and positive-negative evaluation. This evaluation expresses admiration for both the humor and consistency of the film's darker themes and suggests that the author is intrigued and impressed with the overall quality and coherence of the film.

From breakfast to dinner and even dessert, this versatile meal is sure to please regardless of when it's served or what it's topped with. But, are your homemade waffles truly reaching their maximum potential? Follow this comprehensive guide to ensure every waffle you make is nothing short of perfect. 1. Preheat Your Waffle Iron: A well-preheated waffle iron is key to cooking those perfectly browned waffles with consistent texture throughout. Preheating the waffle iron allows it to reach and maintain a stable temperature, essential for evenly cooking your batter. Most waffle irons have an indicator light or beep to let you know when they're ready. If yours doesn't, you can generally assume that it takes about 5-10 minutes for the iron to come to temperature. Make sure you don't skip this crucial step, as using an improperly heated iron leads to uneven cooking and disappointing waffles. 2. Preheat Your Oven (if necessary): If you're cooking for a crowd, preheating your oven is an excellent way to keep waffles warm and crisp while you finish cooking the remaining batter. Set your oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius) and place a wire rack on a baking sheet. As you finish each batch of waffles, transfer them to the wire rack and keep them in the oven. The low temperature ensures the waffles stay warm without overcooking, while the wire rack ensures air can circulate, preventing sogginess. 3. Mix Your Dry Ingredients: Combining your dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl first ensures proper distribution of the leavening agents (such as baking powder), which affects how well the waffles rise. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and any additional spices or add-ins you prefer (such as cinnamon or cocoa powder). Make sure to sift the dry ingredients to break up any lumps, as they can lead to uneven cooking in the waffle iron. 4. Combine the Wet Ingredients: In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients, which typically include milk, eggs, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract. Whisking in a separate bowl ensures a homogeneous blend, providing the perfect foundation for a smooth waffle batter. 5. Beat Together Both Mixtures: Gently pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients, and stir using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Mix until just combined and smooth, breaking up any lumps, but be cautious not to overmix, as this can cause the waffles to become tough. If desired, you can also fold in ingredients such as chocolate chips, berries, or nuts at this stage. 6. Pour the Batter into Your Waffle Iron: Before pouring the batter, make sure to lightly coat your preheated waffle iron with cooking spray or brush it with oil or melted butter to prevent sticking. Using a measuring cup or ladle, pour enough batter to cover approximately 2/3 of the waffle iron's surface. The batter will expand as it cooks, filling the remaining space and creating that perfect waffle shape. 7. Cook Until Medium Golden Brown: Close the lid of the waffle iron and bake until the waffle is medium golden brown, with slightly crisp edges and a tender interior. Cooking time will vary depending on your waffle iron and batter, usually between 3-6 minutes. Keep an eye on your waffles and trust your senses - if you smell or see signs of burning, remove the waffle immediately. 8. Keep Warm: Transfer finished waffles to the preheated oven and wire rack (as mentioned in step 2) until you're ready to serve. Conclusion: Now that you've mastered the art of perfect waffles, you're sure to delight family and friends with an array of toppings, such as fresh fruit, whipped cream, or maple syrup. Remember, practice makes perfect – experiment with variations in ingredients and toppings to personalize this classic dish and make it a staple in your culinary arsenal.

Please answer the following question: Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge of women in the workforce may mean a rejection of marriage. Many women, according to this hypothesis, would rather work than marry. The converse of this concern is that becoming a multi-paycheck household could encourage marriage. In the past, only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision. Now, however, the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner. Data show that economic downturns tend to put off marriage because the parties cannot afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead. As the economy comes to life, the number of marriages also rises. The increase in divorce rates follows to the increase in women working outside the home. Yet, it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause-and-effect conclusions. The impact of a wife's work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions. The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage. But the reverse is equally plausible . Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage. By raising a family's standard of living, a working wife may strengthen her family's financial and emotional stability. Psychological factors also should be considered. For example, a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house. She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce. On the other hand, if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home, work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union. Also, a major part of women's inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that, in most cases, men have remained the main breadwinners. A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house. Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions, it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities. It is said in the passage that when the economy falls _ A) men would choose working women as their marriage partners B) more women would get married to seek financial security C) even working women would worry about their marriages D) more people would prefer to remain single for the time being Answer:","completion":"D) more people would prefer to remain single for the time being"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Renowned journalist Politkovskaya, 48, was shot to death in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building in October 2006. Dozens of journalists have been killed and brutally... (Associated Press) MOSCOW (AP) — The brazen killing of exiled Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko in the Ukrainian capital Kiev on Tuesday evening has highlighted the dangers of working as a journalist in Russia. Dozens of Russian journalists have been killed or brutally beaten in recent years, in clear retribution for their work. In most cases, their attackers walked free. Here's a look at some of the high-profile cases: ANNA POLITKOVSKAYA Anna Politkovskaya was a prominent journalist at the Novaya Gazeta newspaper who was famous for her critical coverage of the war in Chechnya. She was shot dead in her apartment block in 2006. Politkovskaya chronicled the killings and torture of civilians by the Russian military. She wrote a book critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his campaign in Chechnya, documenting widespread abuse of civilians by government troops. Politkovskaya frequently received threats and was vilified by state media as being unpatriotic. Five men were convicted in the killing but the investigators never found those who ordered the murder, and her family blamed the government for its unwillingness to go after the masterminds. ___ MIKHAIL BEKETOV Beketov suffered brain damage and lost a leg after a brutal assault in 2008 following his reporting and campaign against a highway project against Moscow. He died five years later. Beketov wrote about corruption in Khimki, a town near the 8 billion highway. The founder and editor of a local newspaper, Beketov was among the first to raise the alarm about the destruction of the local forest and suspicions local officials were profiting from the project. In November 2008, Beketev was beaten so viciously that he was left unable to speak. He was in coma for several months and spent more than two years in hospitals. His attackers were never found. ___ ANASTASIA BABUROVA Freelance journalist Baburova was shot and killed in 2009 on a sidewalk in central Moscow as she attempted to intervene when a human rights lawyer, renowned for his work on abuses in Chechnya was also murdered by a masked gunman. Lawyer Stanislav Markelov was shot in the back of the head at close range in broad daylight by a gunman who followed him from a news conference. Baburova, who was walking back with the lawyer from the news conference, was also killed as she attempted to help Markelov. Baburova, a freelance journalist in her mid-20s, had worked for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, also Politkovskaya's employer. ___ OLEG KASHIN Intrepid reporter Kashin was viciously beaten by two unidentified attackers outside his home in November 2010 and narrowly escaped death. He spent days in an induced coma with a fractured skull, and had one finger partially amputated. He survived and eventually recovered. Kashin has written on a wide range of social and political issues, some politically sensitive. Shortly after the attack, Kashin said he suspected then-Pskov governor Andrei Turchak to be behind the attempt on his life as a reaction to a critical post he wrote about him on his blog. Russia's then-President Dmitry Medevdev at the time pledged to solve the attack. Kashin was originally full of praise for the investigators who appeared to be trying to find his attackers, but the probe stalled shortly afterward. Frustrated with lack of progress in the investigation, Kashin conducted his own probe into the attack and several years later publicly accused Turchak of placing an order to cripple or kill him. Turchak has never been questioned, and has denied the accusations. He currently holds a senior post in the ruling pro-Kremlin party. ___ KHADZHIMURAD KAMALOV Kamalov, founder of a newspaper in Russia's North Caucasus critical of authorities, was gunned down outside his office in Makhachkala, capital of the Dagestan region, in December 2011. Kamalov's leading independent weekly paper Chernovik has reported extensively on police abuses in the fight against an Islamist insurgency that originated in neighboring Chechnya and has spread across the region. In 2008, authorities brought a criminal case against several Chernovik journalists under anti-extremist legislation after they published an interview with a former guerrilla leader. A court acquitted them earlier this year. Kamalov's killers were never found. ___ ARKADY BABCHENKO Babchenko served in the Russian army and fought during Russia's two wars in Chechnya during the 1990s, first as a conscript, later as a contract soldier. He then became a journalist and worked as a military correspondent for several Russian media outlets. He has written several memoirs of his time as a soldier. A scathing critic of the Russian government, Babchenko covered Russia's war with Georgia and the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, blaming Russia for targeting civilians. In December 2016, Babchenko outraged many when he wrote in a Facebook post that he wasn't sorry for the military band and state television journalists who died in a plane crash on their way to Russia's military base in Syria. Several Russian lawmakers even called for stripping Babchenko of his citizenship over the comment, and Russian state media called him a traitor. Babchenko fled Russia in February 2017, fearing for his life. He moved to Kiev last fall where he worked as a host for the Crimean Tatar TV station, ATR. Babchenko was shot dead in Kiev on Tuesday, and was found in his apartment by his wife. ||||| Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, right, and Vasily Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service speaks to the media during a news conference at the Ukrainian Security Service on Wednesday, May...

Babchenko turned up at a news conference in the Ukrainian capital Wednesday less than 24 hours... (Associated Press) KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian journalist who was reportedly gunned down in Ukraine's capital strolled into a news conference that authorities called Wednesday to discuss the investigation of his death, revealing that the slaying had been staged to foil an alleged Kremlin hit plot. \\"I'm still alive,\\" Arkady Babchenko, 41, told startled fellow reporters at the news conference held less than 24 hours after police reported he had been shot and killed at his Kiev apartment building. Ukrainian police said Tuesday that Babchenko, a strong critic of the Kremlin, was shot multiple times in the back Tuesday and found bleeding there by his wife. Authorities said they suspected he was killed because of his work. Babchenko apologized to his wife, who he said was not briefed on the scheme in advance, \\"for the hell she had to go through in the past two days. There was no choice there, either.\\" Neither he nor Vasyl Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, provided details of how they staged Babchenko's injuries or made his wife believe he was dead. The movie-like twist came as Gritsak convened the news conference to announce that the security agency and the police had solved Babchenko's reported slaying. He then confused everyone there by inviting the supposed slaying into the room. To applause and gasps, Babchenko took the floor and apologized to the friends and family who mourned for him and were unaware of the plan. \\"I'm still alive,\\" he said. \\"I know that sickening feeling when you bury a colleague. I'm sorry you had to go through this but there was no other way.\\" Before ushering Babchenko into the room, Gritsak said investigators had identified a Ukrainian citizen who allegedly was paid 40,000 by the Russian security service to organize and carry out the hit. The unidentified Ukrainian man in turn allegedly hired an acquaintance to be the gunman, Gritsak said. The man allegedly paid to organize Banchenko's killing was detained Wednesday, he said, showing a video of the arrest. Gritsak said killing Babchenko was part of a larger alleged plot by Russian security services. The Ukrainian man was also supposed to procure large quantities of weapons and explosives, including 300 AK-47 rifles and \\"hundreds of kilos of explosives,\\" to perpetrate acts of terror in Ukraine, he said. Babchenko said he was not allowed to go into the details of the sting operation, but said Ukrainian law enforcement had been aware of a contract on his head for two months. He said he was approached by the Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, a month ago. \\"The important thing is my life has been saved and other, bigger terrorist attacks have been thwarted,\\" he said. Babchenko, one of Russia's best-known war reporters, fled the country in February 2017 after receiving death threats. He spoke and wrote about leaving the country because of the threats against him and his family. He said his home address was published online and the threats he received were made by phone, email and social media. Ilya Ponomarev, a former Russian lawmaker who also moved to Ukraine, said Babchenko continued being threatened after he settled last fall in Kiev, where he worked as a host for the Crimean Tatar TV station. Babchenko did not take the intimidation too seriously, Ponomarev said Wednesday before the fact that the slaying was staged came out. Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine were topics on which the journalist was scathingly critical of the Kremlin. Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko lashed out Wednesday at Ukrainian politicians and civil groups who accused the government following Babchenko's faked assassination of allowing contract killings to happen. ___ Vasilyeva reported from Moscow.

Vasily Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, told a news conference on Wednesday the agency faked Babchenko's death to catch those who were trying to kill him. Kiev and national police had said Babchenko, a strong critic of the Kremlin, was shot multiple times in the back at his apartment building and found bleeding by his wife. He showed up at Gritsak's new conference on Wednesday and thanked everyone who was mourning his death. Babchenko, 41, one of Russia's best-known war reporters, spoke and wrote year about leaving the country because of repeated threats that he and his family would be harmed. ___ 2:35 p.m. A top lawmaker says Russia is willing to help Ukraine investigate the murder of a Russian journalist. Arkady Babchenko, who was scathingly critical of the Kremlin, was gunned down in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on Tuesday. Babchenko fled Russia last year, fearing for his life, and settled in Ukraine. He had served in the Russian army during the two wars in Chechnya in 1990s and became one of Russia's best-known war reporters. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, told Russian news agencies Wednesday that Russia would be happy to help with the investigation if Ukrainian authorities requested it. Ukrainian authorities have said they think Babchenko was killed because of his work. Several Ukrainian politicians blamed the Kremlin for the killing. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed those comments as cynical. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, who was reported killed in his Kiev apartment on 29 May, appeared alive at a news conference on 30 May.

How do you do this: Make cookies without oven.","completion":"Making cookies without an oven might seem challenging but it's absolutely possible. There are a few different methods you can follow such as stovetop cooking, using a microwave, or steaming. Here's a detailed method on how to make no-bake cookies using a stove: Ingredients: 1) 2 cups of sugar 2) 1/2 cup of milk 3) 1/2 cup of unsalted butter 4) 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder 5) 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter 6) 3 cups of oats 7) 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract Procedure: 1. Begin by laying out a piece of wax paper or a silicone baking mat on your countertop or table. This is where you'll put the cookies to cool and harden, so you'll want to have this ready to go before you start cooking. 2. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, milk, butter, and unsweetened cocoa powder. Stir everything together until it's well combined. 3. Heat the saucepan over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Allow the mixture to continue boiling for about a minute. Be sure to stir the mixture often to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. 4. After a minute, remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the peanut butter to the saucepan and stir it until it's fully incorporated into the mixture. 5. Add the oats and vanilla extract to the saucepan and stir everything together until the oats are fully coated in the mixture. 6. Once the oats are coated, you can begin forming your cookies. Using a spoon, scoop out some of the cookie mixture and place it on the wax paper or silicone baking mat. You can make the cookies as large or as small as you'd like. 7. Repeat the previous step until you've used up all of your cookie mixture. 8. Leave the cookies on the wax paper or silicone baking mat to cool and harden. This should take about 15-20 minutes. 9. Once the cookies have hardened, they're ready to eat! Simply lift them off the wax paper or silicone baking mat and enjoy! Remember, for no-bake cookies it's crucial to let them harden properly, it would be ideal to leave them overnight. If they're still soft and mushy, they likely need more time to set. The exact setting time can vary depending on the specific ingredients you used and the size of your cookies. Please note also that no-bake cookies are generally softer in texture than baked cookies, due to their cooking process. So, they won't have the same crispy texture as oven-baked cookies. But, they'll still be delicious and satisfy your sweet craving. Please also handle the hot mixture carefully while making the cookies. The sugar and butter mixture can become extremely hot and could cause burns if not handled carefully., Consider having an adult present if kids are involved in making these cookies. Do remember, no-bake cookies have a shorter shelf life compared to baked cookies. Depending on the recipe, they can last up to a week if properly stored in an airtight container."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the European Union, discussions between member states and the European Parliament are vital. The European Parliament is one of the key legislative bodies of the EU, along with the Council of the European Union. The Parliament consists of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who are directly elected by EU citizens. The function of the Parliament is to debate and pass European laws, with the Council, based on proposals presented by the European Commission. It is therefore crucial that there be open and direct communication or discussions between these entities to ensure that all decisions made are for the benefit of all member states and that they reflect the will and best interests of the citizens they represent. On the other hand, the member states are the individual countries that belong to the European Union. There are currently 27 countries in the EU, ranging from more significant nations like Germany and France to smaller countries like Malta and Cyprus.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Answer this question please: Which scientist read more about tree leaves falling on the forest floor?

Where the NRA was putting their money into one side, I decided to put my money into the other side,\\" Bloomberg said on NBC's \\"Meet the Press.\\" \\"We won four out of seven,\\" he said. \\"And we won with a small amount of money. There is this myth that the NRA is so powerful.\\" \\"Today, the NRA's power is so vastly overrated. The public, when you do the polls, they want to stop this carnage. And if 20 kids isn't enough to convince 'em, I don't know what would be,\\" Bloomberg said in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn. The mayor — an outspoken advocate against illegal guns — said that the lobbying group failed to unseat President Barack Obama in November's election as well. \\"The NRA's number one objective this time was to defeat Barack Obama for a second term. Last time I checked the election results, he won and he won comfortably,\\" Bloomberg said. \\"This myth that the NRA can destroy political careers is just not true.\\" In the aftermath of the latest shooting, some critics are calling for a revision of the nation's gun laws — something that the NRA has long opposed. \\"If Congress wasn't so afraid of the NRA — and I can show you that they have no reason to be — but if they were to stand up and do what was right for the American public, we'd all be a lot better off,\\" Bloomberg said.

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Sunday called for three specific steps Congress can take to stop gun violence in the United States, starting with the restoration of the federal assault weapons ban. \\"One is to ban assault weapons, try and reinstate the assault weapons bans,\\" he said on CBS's \\"Face the Nation.\\" \\"Second is to limit the size of clips to maybe no more than 10 bullets per clip, and third is to make it harder for mentally unstable people to get guns.\\" Schumer said any action on reforming gun laws has been difficult thus far because of political gridlock on Capitol Hill. \\"We’ve been gridlocked,\\" he said. \\"We need a new paradigm … Both sides are in their corner and they can come to the middle\\" He added that, just as anti-gun control advocates need to be willing to compromise, those in favor of stronger gun laws need to acknowledge the Second Amendment rights of ordinary citizens. \\"Those of us who are pro-gun control have to admit that there is a Second Amendment right to bear arms,\\" he said. Read more about: Chuck Schumer, Connecticut School Shooting |||||Summary:","completion":"In the aftermath of the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which resulted in the tragic deaths of 26 people, including 20 children, politicians and lawmakers began discussing ways to prevent such devastating incidents from recurring. One such suggestion was made by former Education Secretary William Bennett, who proposed that schools consider arming certain employees as a means of defense against potential mass shootings. Bennett's recommendation came with the caveats that armed employees should be trained and responsible individuals. He cited the brave actions of Sandy Hook Elementary's principal and school psychologist who tried to protect the students but were ultimately unarmed and overpowered. Similarly, Rep. Louie Gohmert suggested that more guns, rather than fewer, could help protect citizens in situations like the Newtown school shooting, and that a gun in the principal's office could have changed the outcome. However, other lawmakers and prominent figures argued for stricter gun control measures to protect citizens. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein vowed to reintroduce a federal ban on assault weapons, urging the support of President Barack Obama. The proposed bill would ban the sale, transfer, importation, and possession of assault weapons and ammunition clips that can hold more than 10 bullets. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban previously enacted such restrictions from 1994 to 2004 but was allowed to lapse by Congress. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for a revision of the nation's gun laws and argued that the influence of the National Rifle Association (NRA) was overrated, stating that the polls showed the public supported measures to end gun violence. The Newtown school shooting sparked renewed discussions on gun control and the role of firearms in protecting citizens, along with debates on the interpretation of the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms."},{"prompt":"Title: Simply the BEST Review: This is a great CD , It will change your standard ,the sound is outoutstanding , It is a MUST BUY for Classical listener.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Now, I have a new situation: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Answer this question please: Who has more abnormal cells in their body? Answer:","completion":"Jason has more abnormal cells in his body. This is because he has been diagnosed with cancer, a disease that causes cells to divide out of control due to mutations in genes that control the cell cycle. These abnormal cell divisions often lead to the development of a tumor, which is a mass of abnormal tissue. On the other hand, Charlotte does not have cancer but has been diagnosed with high blood pressure, a condition not directly related to abnormal cell growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

MAMONI VALLEY PRESERVE, Panama (CNN) -- A famed primatologist says the plight of chimpanzees helped inspire Michael Jackson to write the song \\"Heal the World.\\" Michael Jackson loved chimpanzees, said Jane Goodall: \\"They made him smile.\\" But the theme and the lyrics of the song turned out to be about a better world for humanity. \\"He wrote what he told me he thought was his most powerful song ever, but it didn't end up for animals,\\" Jane Goodall said in a CNN interview Thursday night. Goodall spoke exclusively to CNN in a Panamanian rain forest where she is exploring a partnership on behalf of Roots & Shoots, her global youth education program. The interview comes as a new version of the song, first released on Jackson's 1991 \\"Dangerous\\" album, is being recorded by a collection of artists for release in late October. Goodall became friends with Jackson about 20 years ago when he invited her to his Neverland Ranch, where \\"he talked about his dreams for the place to have animals running, looking free like they would in the wild. ...

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Please answer the following question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

Which entity is this text about? Plato (; Greek: Platon Platon, pronounced [pla.to:n] in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 - 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. Although Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence of Pythagoras upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of Plato. According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points: (1) The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of \\"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\\", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as \\"for substantial theses in science and morals\\". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a \\"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\\". It is probable that both were influenced by Orphism. Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. This ideas were very influential in Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato. Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, and Cicero repeats this claim: \\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\\" (Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia). George Karamanolis notes that Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy--including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally. The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his Apology of Socrates that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d-34a). Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 minas on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by Meletus (38b). In the Phaedo, the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, \\"Plato was ill\\". (Phaedo 59b) Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the Second Letter, it says, \\"no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new\\" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, Xenophon and Aristophanes seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form. Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates (Metaphysics 987b1-11). Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding. Mythos and logos are terms that evolved along classical Greece history. In the times of Homer and Hesiod (8th century BC) they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of tale or history. Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between both terms, and mythos became more a nonverifiable account, and logos a rational account. Plato, being a disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use. Plato, in general, distinguished between three types of myth. First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul. It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths. Entity:","completion":"The text is about the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato. It discusses various aspects of his life, philosophies, influences, and contributions to the Western philosophical tradition.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said. Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" Question: How long after Timothy Carpenter was convicted did he continue to rob people?

What is the solution?","completion":"Sure. Let's solve the equation step by step. Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. The equation is: 2683*v = -3250*v + 5364*v - 70556. Combining -3250*v and 5364*v, we have: 2683*v = 2114*v - 70556. Step 2: Subtraction of 2114*v from both sides. By doing so, we aim to isolate 'v' on one side of the equation. Subtracting 2114*v from both sides results in: 2683*v - 2114*v = -70556, which simplifies to 569*v = -70556. Step 3: Solving for 'v'. We will now divide both sides by 569 to find the value of 'v'. Doing so gives us: v = -70556 / 569. This simplifies to: v = -123.9297 (rounded to four decimal places). So, the solution to the equation is v = -123.9297."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, let's examine the inference in question: \\"The hospital has a full time Psychiatrist since December 2014.\\" This statement suggests that the hospital had a full-time Psychiatrist starting from December 2014. However, based on the provided information, the hospital has had a full-time Psychiatrist only since December 2015. Therefore, we cannot infer that the hospital has a full-time Psychiatrist since December 2014, as the given information contradicts this inference."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],R={key:0},N={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
