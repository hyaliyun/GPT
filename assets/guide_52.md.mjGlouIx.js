Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what is a jew Context: Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased.

A rescue cat looks set to be crowned the world's oldest feline after her owners found proof she is a staggering 28-years-old. Pinky who was born in July 1986, which makes her 129 in human years, was taken in by her owners Ann and Bob Higginbottom as a four-month-old kitten and she has lived with the couple ever since in Dunston, Lincolnshire. The pair have documentation of early visits to vets, which prove that at 28-years-old Pinky could be officially the world's oldest cat. Pinky, who is celebrating her 28th birthday, which could make her the world's oldest cat poses next to her birthday cake. The Guinness Book of Records has a cat from Bournemouth called Poppy, listed as the world's oldest, but she died earlier this month aged 24 meaning Pinky could take the crown. Pinky and her brother Perky, who died 10 years ago, were rescued by Bob and Ann after being born on a farm and taken to an RSPCA rehoming centre. This was at a time when Top Gun was wowing cinema audiences, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Madonna was top of the charts. But these days Pinky now spends her time in the warmth of the couple's greenhouse at their new bungalow or sunning herself as she watches their ornamental Koi. Today retired caterer Mrs Higginbottom said that Pinky was now completely deaf and 'turning into an old lady'. Her owner, Ann Higginbottom of Dunston in Lincolnshire took in Pinky and her brother Perky, when they were just four-month-old kittens. The 73-year-old explained: 'We got her and Perky when they were just four months old. 'She is amazing really, completely deaf now as is to be expected, but her eyesight is still as sharp as ever. 'She is turning into an old lady now, she likes to sit by our Koi pond and just watch them as they swim about. 'She isn't interested in catching them any more, just likes to watch them. 'When we first got them they chose to live in the barn when we lived at the manor house. Mrs Higginbottom says she has proof of Pinky's age as she kept certificates from vets, showing when the cat had vaccinations. 'It was up to them, I imagine it was because they came from a farm and where used to living out there. 'Now she spends her time out in the greenhouse. 'She comes in and likes to be petted but that's just where she likes to be. She does not like being picked up, but nor do many cats.' The oldest cat ever, according to Guinness World Records, died in Texas, USA, in August 2005 at the age of 38 years. Mrs Higginbottom said that she and her husband were now looking to approach Guinness World Records with Pinky's certificates. Other cats have laid claim to the title, but their owners don't have any documentation to prove their pet is the oldest feline. Mrs Higginbottom said that she and retired quantity surveyor Mr Higginbottom, 87, were now looking to approach Guinness World Records with Pinky's certificates. She added: 'It would be incredible for Pinky to be recognised as the world's oldest cat and as far as we can see there is nothing stopping her being crowned that.'

Information: - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace. - Schio is a town and comune in the province of Vicenza (region of Veneto, northern Italy) situated North of Vicenza and East of the Lake of Garda. It is surrounded by the Little Dolomites (Italian Prealps) and Mount Pasubio.\\"'\\"Which is Sheridan more like, Mantova or Verona or Vicenza? It isn't like any of those. It is right up against the mountains, almost like Schio.\\" \\"Ernest Hemingway\\" History. Its name comes from Latin: escletum was a wood of oaks and it was first used in a document of some Benedictines from Vicenza. The first settlements were around two old hills, where now there are respectively the ruins of an old castle and a majestic neoclassical cathedral. - An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, four-wheeler, or quadricycle as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles. Although it is a street-legal vehicle in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states and provinces of Australia, the United States or Canada. - A moped (/mopd/ MOH-ped) is a small motorcycle, generally having a less stringent licensing requirement than motorcycles or automobiles because mopeds typically travel about the same speed as bicycles on public roadways. Strictly speaking, mopeds are driven by both an engine and by bicycle pedals, but in common usage and in many jurisdictions the term moped is used for similar vehicles including a scooter, though this is quite erroneous. Mopeds occasionally resemble powered bicycles, more commonly called a motorized bicycle, though since ca. 2006 there has been a glut of engine kits shipped from China (although Tanaka had offered drive kits since the 1960s) designed in theory to transform a standard bicycle into a motor vehicle but lacking the benefit of proper brakes and lighting. In addition, the added stresses can cause the rear rim to warp, and the spokes to break, and if the engine is the least bit out of alignment the drive chain will come off the drive sprocket, causing the rim to warp and the spokes to break, as well as lodging the chain in the chainstay and causing injury to the operator. Some mopeds are of a step-through type design, while others are step-over, or \\"top tank\\", designs, having a motorcycle-like frame, including a \\"backbone\\" and a raised fuel tank (known as a \\"top tank\\" among moped enthusiasts), mounted directly between the saddle and the head tube. Most are similar to a regular motorcycle, only having the addition of pedals, in which the rider can both manually power the vehicle through a bicycle-like crankset in addition to a small displacement engine. Although mopeds usually have two wheels, some regions classify low-powered three- or (rarely) four-wheeled vehicles as a moped. Many(US ?)states have laws on the books that anyone convicted of a DUI cannot legally operate any motor vehicle powered by gasoline for the entire length of their sentence. - Derbi is a manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters, mopeds and recreational all-terrain vehicles produced by Nacional Motor S.A.U., a Spanish subsidiary of Piaggio & Co.

These are two muscular tubes that carry urine to the urinary bladder. Contractions of the muscles of the ureters move the urine along by peristalsis. The urinary bladder is a sac-like organ that stores urine. When the bladder is about half full, a sphincter relaxes to let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra. The urethra is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body through another sphincter. The process of urine leaving the body is called urination.

Other notable songs on the album include \\"Mellow my man,\\" which exemplifies the tempo changes that are the hallmark of jazz, \\"The lesson,\\" a freestyle-type song over an incredible beatbox courtesy of Rah, and \\"Distortion to static,\\" one of those songs that becomes an immovable force in one's head.

Process: - There is a fetus in the womb - They are born and are a baby - The baby grows into a child - Puberty turns the child into an adolescent - The adolescent becomes an adult - An adult becomes an elderly person - The elderly person dies. Question: suppose less children become adolescents happens, how will it affect more fetus in womb. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"C: No effect To understand the relationship between the number of children becoming adolescents and the number of fetuses in the womb, we can first assess the developmental stages involved in an individual's life. The process begins with a fetus forming in the womb during pregnancy. From there, the fetus eventually grows and is born as a baby. As the baby develops physically, cognitively, and emotionally, it transitions through different stages of life, such as child, adolescent, adult, and eventually reaching the elderly stage before their death. Now, if we consider the scenario where fewer children become adolescents, this could be attributed to various factors such as higher child mortality rates, lower birth rates, or a combination of both. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that these factors affect the demographics or population size and growth at large rather than directly impacting the number of fetuses in the womb. The number of fetuses in the womb is solely dependent on the number of pregnancies. Multiple factors can influence the number of pregnancies, including fertility rates, access to reproductive health services, cultural norms, and individual preferences. Additionally, aspects such as the availability of contraceptives, socio-economic circumstances, advancements in fertility treatments, and overall health of the population can impact the number of pregnancies and subsequently the number of fetuses in the womb as well. If a society experiences a decline in the number of children transitioning into adolescence, it may potentially prompt policymakers to modify family planning policies or encourage an increase in birth rates to maintain a sustainable population size. These changes could affect the number of fetuses in the womb indirectly at a later stage, be it an increase or decrease. In conclusion, the number of children becoming adolescents does not have a direct effect on the number of fetuses in the womb. However, it can indirectly reflect certain population growth and demographic trends that may prompt changes to socio-economic factors or policies, which could eventually influence the number of pregnancies. Still, the direct relationship between children becoming adolescents and the number of fetuses in the womb remains non-existent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Deidre loved this change so much that she decided to open a special place called a fitness studio, where people go to exercise and become healthy too!

Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator. By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's low spending on R&D relative to its revenue (compared to IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Apple Inc.)—which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile devices. Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized. Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle.

Theresa Villiers is meeting the NI parties following Tuesday night's rejection of the Welfare Reform Bill. Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Green Party made a petition of concern, a blocking mechanism, that meant it did not get the required cross-community support. Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness it would be \\"huge mistake\\" for Westminster to take control of welfare in NI. On Wednesday, the secretary of state said: \\"In this situation it means looking at a range of options, some of which are certainly options we wouldn't want to choose in the best of circumstances. \\"But I think I can't rule out action on this at Westminster, but we're some way away from that as we speak, there is still more that can be done to try and reach a resolution through the devolved institutions.\\" Sinn Féin's Mr McGuinness said it would be unacceptable for Westminster to take over Northern Ireland welfare powers. \\"I'll be meeting Theresa Villiers in the morning and I'll be telling her that would be a huge mistake,\\" he said. The DUP's Sammy Wilson said the welfare reform bill was now dead \\"The financial consequences which stem from that are going to roll out not just this year, but next year and the year after that. We're entering uncharted waters,\\" the DUP's Sammy Wilson said. \\"I think the only answer for this, since there's not the maturity amongst the nationalist parties in the assembly to deal with this issue, the government must now take on the welfare reform issue itself. A majority of 58 assembly members voted in favour and 39 voted against the bill to make changes to benefits that have been introduced in the rest of the UK. But the bill was defeated by a petition of concern supported by nationalist parties and the Green Party. The measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly. If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions. There were several mitigation schemes in the bill that would have lessened its impact. David Ford of the Alliance Party said it was not clear what would happen now. \\"Within the next couple of weeks we have to resolve the budget issue, not just the June monitoring round - the reallocation between departments in year - but actually to pass the bill to allow departments to spend money in the second half of the financial year,\\" he said. \\"So that's a measure of the crisis we're in, that has to be resolved and it's unclear at this stage how that will be resolved.\\" Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Sinn Féin was making the vulnerable in Northern Ireland suffer for their political aspirations in the Republic. \\"We now stand closer than ever to the point where we witness the death of democracy in Northern Ireland. This will come when duly elected politicians have to hand over power to a civil servant,\\" he said. TUV leader Jim Allister said \\"the chickens are coming home to roost in the failure of mandatory coalition\\". Shadow NI secretary Ivan Lewis said: \\"All Northern Ireland's parties have to accept responsibility for making the difficult choices necessary to set a viable budget as a matter of urgency.\\" The Northern Ireland parties had agreed a deal on Westminster's welfare reform measures in the Stormont House Agreement last December.

Goal: mouth Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Options: a). can consume from forks b). can consume from pencil ...I think the answer is","completion":"a). can consume from forks In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let us first analyze both options and explain why option a is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of mouth. Option A: Can Consume from Forks Forks are primarily designed as a utensil for eating and handling food. They consist of a handle and several tines, which are specifically tailored for various types of food. Forks have been used for centuries in various cultures and have evolved over time to serve different purposes related to food consumption. Here are some key reasons why using forks is a more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of mouth: 1. Practical design: Forks are created with a user-friendly design that eases the process of consuming food. The tines are engineered to help pick up and hold food items, making it easier for users to transfer the food from their plates to their mouths. 2. Hygienic use: Forks help maintain a higher level of hygiene while eating as they minimize direct contact between the hands and the food. Touching food with bare hands can result in the transfer of germs from one's hands to the mouth, potentially causing illnesses. By using a fork, the risk of germ transfer reduces significantly. 3. Versatile uses: Forks can be used to consume a wide variety of food items, ranging from salads to meats to pasta. The utensil is highly adaptable and can fit the requirements of various meals. Option B: Can Consume from Pencil A pencil generally serves as a writing instrument consisting of a thin cylindrical core made of either graphite or a solid pigment, encased within a wooden or other material casing. A pencil's primary function is to create visible marks on surfaces such as paper, which makes it unfit for consumption or accomplishing the goal of mouth. Here are a few reasons that highlight why consuming from a pencil is not reasonable: 1. Unintended purpose: Pencils are intended for writing or drawing purposes, not for food consumption. Using them for eating would be using the tool for a purpose it was not designed for and may potentially lead to damage to the pencil. 2. Safety concerns: The materials used in the construction of a pencil, such as graphite and wood, can cause harm if ingested. Attempting to consume food using a pencil could lead to parts of the pencil breaking off and being swallowed, posing a choking hazard. 3. Inefficiency: Attempting to pick up food using a pencil and transferring it to one's mouth would be a highly inefficient process. The pencil lacks the design features, such as tines, which are present in forks, making it extremely difficult to grip and hold the food properly. In conclusion, it is clear that option A, \\"can consume from forks,\\" is the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of mouth. Forks are specifically designed for food consumption, ensuring practicality, hygiene, and versatility when eating. On the contrary, using pencils for this purpose would be unsuitable, unsafe, and inefficient due to their construction and the unintended nature of their primary use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tweet:@simple_sy can't am sorry, really wanna come bt bhai is leaving tomorrow....so wanna spend time with him.. there is always a next time","completion":"The sentiment of the given tweet can be understood to be a mix of mild disappointment, regret and hope for the future. The tweet implies that the person wants to attend an event or meet with @simple_sy but cannot because they have another significant commitment involving a family member (in this case, the use of \\"bhai\\" suggests the person's brother). There are a few elements in the tweet that contribute to an understanding of the sentiment expressed: 1. “Can’t am sorry”: This phrase indicates disappointment, as the person feels regretful for not being able to attend or meet the other person. The use of \\"am sorry\\" emphasizes their sense of guilt and regret for not being available. 2. “Really wanna come”: This part reveals the desire to attend the event or meet @simple_sy; however, as previously mentioned, the speaker cannot do so. This shows a mixture of regret and disappointment in not being able to fulfill their wish. 3. “Bhai is leaving tomorrow”: The introduction of a conflicting and legitimate reason for not being able to attend offers an explanation for their absence. This reason may evoke a sympathetic understanding, as spending time with family is a common reason for prioritizing and making decisions based on interpersonal relationships. 4. “Wanna spend time with him”: The person emphasizes their wish to spend time with their brother before he leaves. This demonstrates a sentimental value attached to family bonds. It also shows that the person values their time and prefers to engage in meaningful activities (in this case, spending time with family). 5. “There is always a next time”: The final sentiment in the tweet is more positive and hopeful. The sentiment here suggests that the person believes the missed opportunity is not an irreversible loss, and they will have another chance to attend or meet in the future. This more hopeful and forward-looking sentiment counterbalances the overall disappointment expressed in the tweet. In summary, the sentiment of the given tweet can be classified as a mix of mild disappointment, regret, and hope for the future. The person is expressing their desire to attend the event or meet with @simple_sy, but they have a conflicting and meaningful commitment. They hope for another opportunity in the future and thus, leaving the tweet on a more positive note."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman.

Generate a question that has the following answer: John for the following movie plot: This synopsis is from the UNRATED VERSION.A girl (Jane Powell) (Isabelle Almgren-Doré) is running through snowy woods near her house in Boston, Massachusetts. Something unseen is chasing her. She approaches the house and tries to open a double door. It opens and she rushes in, closing it and an inner door which she latches shut. She looks around, picking up a letter opener and leaves the room. The door is forced open by the unseen force. She runs upstairs into her bedroom, bolting the door. The doorknob is rattled as the unseen tries to get in. The noise stops and there is silence. The girl cautiously approaches the door when suddenly the ghostly image of a girl (Betsy Bell) (Rachel Hurd-Wood) appears beside her. She screams and at that moment awakens from a dream, sitting up in bed in hysterics. She is comforted by her mother (Elizabeth Powell) (Susan Almgren) who tells her she had a bad dream again. She suggests a nice warm bath, which is rejected by Jane, saying maybe later. The mother tells her she must get ready to be picked up by her father (David Powell) (Howard Rosenstein) for the weekend. She acknowledges this. Elizabeth picks up some clothes from the floor, noticing a bundle of old things which she asks Jane about. Telling her mother they are from the attic, Jane is told you know the attic is off-limits. Jane apologizes and is told just dont do it again as the mother exits.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two researches studied living organisms, Joe studied eukaryotes, while Bill studied prokaryotes. They were fascinated by genetic variation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which researcher observed more membranes of two cells merging? Hint: Prokaryotes have a different way to increase genetic variation. It’s called genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation . It can occur in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in Figure below , the donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus , or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid , moves into the recipient cell. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to create bacterial cells that carry new genes. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bill, who studied prokaryotes, observed more instances of two cell membranes merging. This process occurs in prokaryotes as part of genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation, which facilitates the exchange of genetic material. In one of the ways this exchange happens, the donor cell creates an F pilus (also known as sex pilus) that attaches to another cell, causing the membranes of the two cells to merge. Following this merging, genetic material, usually in the form of a plasmid, moves into the recipient cell. This process of genetic transfer makes bacteria especially useful in biotechnology, as it enables the creation of bacterial cells carrying new genes."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Information: - The judiciary (also known as the judicial system or court system) is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in the name of the state. The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. In some nations, under doctrines of separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case. In other nations, the judiciary can make law, known as Common Law, by setting precedent for other judges to follow, as opposed to Statutory Law made by the legislature. The Judiciary is often tasked with ensuring equal justice under law. - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The position was created in 1849, the year before California became a state. The current governor is Jerry Brown, a Democrat who was inaugurated January 3, 2011, and who had previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983. In October 2013, Jerry Brown surpassed Earl Warren for the longest cumulative period of time served as governor. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a crowned republic, Ireland is a parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic. - Baja California, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California, is a state in Mexico.

Australia election date set Australians will vote on October 9 in an election pitting the conservative government against centre-left Labor, with national security and the economy as major issues. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about the announcement of a scheduled election date in Australia, which is set for October 9. In this election, the conservative government will be competing against the centre-left Labor party. The main issues at the forefront of the electoral campaign are expected to be national security and the economy. The election will provide an opportunity for Australian citizens to exercise their right to vote and decide which party will form the next government. It will also allow both the conservative government and the centre-left Labor party to present their views, policies, and plans regarding key issues like national security and the economy to the voters, in an effort to gain popular support. National security and the economy are pressing concerns for any nation, and they will likely shape the political discourse during the election campaign. National security typically involves matters related to the protection of the country's citizens, borders, and interests from external threats, such as terrorism, cyber attacks, and other potential dangers. The economy encompasses a wide range of topics, including employment, taxation, trade, infrastructure, fiscal policy, and social welfare policies. In the forthcoming Australian election, it is expected that both the conservative government and the centre-left Labor party will outline their respective strategies for addressing these crucial areas. They will likely propose plans for improving and maintaining the nation's economic health, as well as strengthening its security measures to protect its citizens and assets. As the election approaches, the political atmosphere in Australia will likely become more intense, with parties and candidates engaging in debates, public speeches, and campaign events in order to win over potential voters. The Australian people will closely follow the developments leading up to the election and evaluate the competing proposals and ideologies presented by the conservative government and the centre-left Labor party. Ultimately, the October 9 election will determine which party gains control over the government and sets the course for Australia's future, particularly in critical areas such as national security and economic policy. The announcement of the election date marks the beginning of a crucial period in Australian politics, as the country's citizens prepare to make their voices heard and cast their votes for the party they believe will best serve their interests and the well-being of the nation."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The coastal areas are mostly an alternate series of rías (submerged valleys where the sea penetrates tens of kilometres inland) and cliffs. The climate of Galicia is temperate and rainy, but it is also markedly drier in the summer, being usually classified as Oceanic in the west and north, and Mediterranean in the southeast. Its topographic and climatic conditions have made animal husbandry and farming the primary source of Galicia's wealth for most of its history. With the exception of shipbuilding and food processing, Galicia was largely a semi-subsistence farming and fishing economy and did not experience significant industrialization until after the mid-20th century. In 2012, the gross domestic product at purchasing power parity was €56,000 million, with a nominal GDP per capita of €20,700. The population is largely concentrated in two coastal areas: from Ferrol to A Coruña in the northwest and from Pontevedra to Vigo in the southwest. To a lesser extent, there are smaller populations around the interior cities of Lugo, Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. The political capital is Santiago de Compostela, in the province of A Coruña.

In 1982, he led Italy to the 1982 FIFA World Cup title, scoring six goals to win the Golden Boot as top goalscorer, and the Golden Ball for the player of the tournament. Rossi is one of only three players to have won all three awards at a World Cup, along with Garrincha in 1962, and Mario Kempes in 1978. Rossi was also awarded the 1982 Ballon d'Or as the European Footballer of the Year for his performances. Despite his ban, Rossi was purchased back by Juventus in 1981, and he returned to the starting line-up just in time for the end of the 1981-82 season to contribute to the club's 1981-82 Serie A title (scoring 1 goal in 3 appearances), and to take part in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, with Italy. Italian journalists and tifosi initially lamented that he was in very poor shape, however, and this view seemed to be confirmed by Italy's appalling performance in the three group matches, in which he was allegedly described as a \\"ghost aimlessly wandering over the field\\". Italy manager Enzo Bearzot, however, staunchly confirmed Rossi for the decisive round robin in the second round, in which his team was to face Argentina, the reigning World Champions, and Brazil, the biggest favourites to win the title, with a team consisting of world-class players such as Socrates, Zico, and Falcao. After Italy defeated Argentina 2-1, also thanks to the defensive work of Claudio Gentile and Gaetano Scirea, who shut down the young Argentinean star Diego Maradona, Rossi scored three memorable goals to defeat Brazil 3-2 to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-final match against Poland, Rossi's two goals won the match for Italy once again, granting them a place in the 1982 World Cup final. In the final against West Germany, Rossi scored the first of Italy's three goals, off of an indirect set-piece assist from Gentile, helping Italy to win the match 3-1, giving his team their third World Cup title. With six goals in total, he won the tournament's maximo goleador award -- the Golden Boot -- as the top scorer of the tournament, as well as the Golden Ball Award for the best player of the tournament, and he was named as part of the team of the tournament for the second consecutive time. Italian fans hung banners proclaiming him \\"Man of the match\\". Rossi's accomplishments in Spain gained him the title of European Footballer of the Year and World Player of the Year in 1982, as well as the 1982 Onze d'Or Award. Due to his notable goalscoring exploits during the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Paolo Rossi earned the nicknames \\"Pablito\\", and the \\"torero\\".

Information: - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin. - In Greek mythology, Melete () was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses before the Nine Olympian Muses were founded. Her sisters were Aoide and Mneme. She was the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means \\"ponder\\" and \\"contemplation\\" in Greek. - Mnemosyne (or ), source of the word \\"mnemonic\\", was the personification of memory in Greek mythology. A Titanide, or Titaness, she was the daughter of the Titans Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne was the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus: - In Greek mythology , Mneme / nimi / ( ) was one of the three original ( Boeotian ) muses , along with her sisters Aoide and Melete before Arche and Thelxinoë were identified , increasing the number to five . Later , the Nine Olympian Muses were named . She was the muse of memory . - Anaximander (\\"Anaximandros\\"; c. 610 c. 546 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils. - In Greek mythology, Aoede (\\"Aoid\\") was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses, which later expanded to five, before the Nine Olympian Muses were named. Her sisters were Melete and Mneme. She was the muse of voice and song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory. - Arche is a Greek word with primary senses \\"beginning\\", \\"origin\\" or \\"source of action\\". (: from the beginning, r : the original argument), and later first principle or element, first so used by Anaximander (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23), principles of knowledge (Aristot. Metaph. 995b8). By extension, it may mean \\"first place, power\\", \\"method of government\\", \\"empire, realm\\", \\"authorities\\" (in plural: ), \\"command\\". The first principle or element corresponds to the \\"ultimate underlying substance\\" and \\"ultimate undemonstrable principle\\". In the philosophical language of the archaic period (8th-6th century BC), \\"arche\\" (or \\"archai\\") designates the source, origin or root of things that exist. In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of \\"arche\\" as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.

Write an article with the title: \\"7 Things You Didn't Know About 3D Printing\\" Article:","completion":"Title: 7 Things You Didn't Know About 3D Printing Introduction 3D printing, a technology that has been around for over three decades, has experienced rapid acceleration and widespread interest in recent years. It is revolutionizing various industries by providing opportunities, innovation, and customization like never before. From creating intricate art pieces and architectural models to manufacturing tailor-made prosthetics and complex machine components, 3D printing has the potential to transform the way we live and work. In this article, we explore seven lesser-known facts about 3D printing to understand this groundbreaking technology even better. 1. 3D Printing Dates Back to the 1980s Although 3D printing may seem like a relatively new technology, its origins date back to the 1980s. American inventor Chuck Hull created the first 3D printer in 1983, with the technology initially known as \\"stereolithography.\\" Hull's creation laid the groundwork for this burgeoning field and continues to shape the industry today. 2. 3D Printing is Environmentally Friendly Compared to traditional manufacturing processes, 3D printing has a lesser environmental impact. It reduces material waste by only using the necessary amount of material for the object being produced. As a result, energy consumption is also lower during the manufacturing process. Additionally, 3D printing enables the production of lighter and more efficient parts, contributing to a reduction in energy usage and overall carbon footprint. 3. It's Not Just About Plastic When it comes to 3D printing, most people think of plastic as the primary material used. However, a wide variety of materials can be used in 3D printing, depending on the type of printer and the desired outcome. For instance, metal powders like stainless steel, aluminum, and titanium can produce sturdy mechanical parts or medical implants. Researchers also experiment with organic materials, such as living cells and food substances, to create innovative products like artificial organs and edible structures. 4. Space Exploration and 3D Printing Governments and space agencies worldwide are exploring the potential of 3D printing to revolutionize space exploration. NASA, for example, has been developing 3D-printed rocket engine components and instruments, which could significantly reduce the cost of future space missions. In addition, 3D printers have been sent to the International Space Station, enabling astronauts to create much-needed tools and equipment while in space, removing the need to send supplies from Earth. 5. 3D Printing in Medicine and Healthcare In recent years, 3D printing has made an impressive impact on medicine and healthcare. Scientists have successfully used bioprinting – a form of 3D printing that uses living cells as \\"ink\\" – to create artificial organs and tissues. In the future, this could pave the way for finding solutions to organ donor shortages and reduce the need for animal testing. Additionally, 3D printing has been used to produce custom-made prosthetics and implants, which provide a better fit and improved functionality for patients. 6. The World's First 3D Printed Building In 2016, the world's first 3D-printed building, a two-story office, was inaugurated in Dubai. This unique structure was produced using a blend of cement and other building materials, proving that 3D printing is not limited to small objects. The successful creation of this building highlights the potential of 3D-printed construction, which could lead to faster, more cost-effective, and increasingly inventive architectural designs. 7. Intellectual Property and Copyright Concerns With the rise of 3D printing technology, new concerns surrounding intellectual property and copyright have emerged. Unlike traditional manufacturing, 3D printing could potentially allow individuals to replicate patented or copyrighted objects without permission. Governments and organizations are working to adapt legal frameworks to address these challenges. Conclusion From its beginnings in the 1980s to its current role as an exceptional tool with enormous potential, 3D printing continues to expand in application and influence countless industries. As technology advances and materials evolve, its capabilities will only grow, promising a more innovative and sustainable future. Understanding lesser-known facts like these helps shed light on the incredible impact of 3D printing on our world and offers a glimpse into what is yet to come."},{"prompt":"I know that the answer to the question \\"The Arrival of the three queens is considered what?\\" is in \\"At certain times of the year, The Queen Mary 2, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria may all visit Southampton at the same time, in an event commonly called 'Arrival of the Three Queens'.\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Georgette Heyer (; 16 August 1902 - 4 July 1974) was an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. While holidaying with her family in December 1920, Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior. The two became regular dance partners while Rougier studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later, Heyer's father died of a heart attack. He left no pension, and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. Two months after her father's death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony. In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer remained at home and continued to write. In 1926, she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000 copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that \\"as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\\" Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass located in the bush; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen. While in Tanganyika, Heyer wrote The Masqueraders; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one anachronism: she placed the opening of White's a year too early. She also wrote an account of her adventures, titled \\"The Horned Beast of Africa\\", which was published in 1929 in the newspaper The Sphere. In 1928, Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family's earnings with her writing.","completion":"This text is about Georgette Heyer, an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist.

Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971. The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the company that markets pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring?, what is it ?

It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning.

Disgraced former Chicago Bears player Sam Hurd was yesterday sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in starting a drug-distribution scheme that ended his football career and left his future in tatters. Hurd, 28, received the punishment in a federal courtroom in Dallas after pleading guilty in April to one count of trying to buy and distribute large amounts of cocaine and marijuana. The charge carried a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum of life. Authorities say that while NFL teammates and friends knew him as a hardworking wide receiver and married father, Hurd was fashioning a separate identity as a wannabe drug kingpin with a focus on 'high-end deals' and a need for large amounts of drugs. U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis gave Hurd a much shorter sentence than the 27 to 34 years recommended by federal sentencing guidelines. Solis noted that the case against Hurd centered on a 'lot of agreements' to buy and sell marijuana and cocaine, rather than physical transactions of drugs. But, the judge said, 'You didn't just start nickel and diming it.' Hurd stood before him in orange jail scrubs after a rambling, emotional 30-minute plea for mercy. Behind him in the gallery were more than a dozen family members and friends. 'You had everything going for you,' Solis told Hurd, adding that he thought the case was a 'tragedy.' Federal inmates are typically not eligible for parole and required to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. Wide receiver: Sam Hurd during the NFL game between The Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys. Hurd's December 2011 arrest outside a. suburban Chicago steakhouse came after he tried to buy a kilogram of. cocaine in what turned out to be a sting. According to a federal. complaint, Hurd told an undercover agent that he wanted 5 to 10. kilograms of cocaine and 1,000 pounds of marijuana per week to. distribute in the Chicago area. He claimed he was already distributing 4 kilograms a week, according to the complaint. A kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. At the time, Hurd was a wide receiver with stints for the Bears and Dallas Cowboys who had played most of his five seasons on special teams. He was in the first year of a three-year contract reportedly worth more than 5 million. The Bears soon cut him. Hurd was released on bail and returned to Texas, where he grew up, but soon fell into trouble again, according to court documents. He allegedly tried to buy more cocaine and marijuana through a cousin, Jesse Tyrone Chavful, and failed two drug tests. That led a magistrate judge in August 2012 to revoke his bail and order him returned to jail. In court: Pictured is a courtroom artist drawing of Chicago Bears wide receiver Sam Hurd, center right, as he makes an initial court appearance before Judge Young Kim, left, on federal drug charges Thursday, December 15, 2011 in Chicago. Hurd spoke near the end of a. four-hour hearing, sometimes reading from handwritten notes and. sometimes looking directly at Solis to plead for mercy. While. he denied leading a major conspiracy or dealing with Chavful, Hurd. admitted to having a marijuana addiction and a weakness for friends who. needed his help. He admitted giving 88,000 to another co-defendant,. Toby Lujan, knowing that the money might go to buy drugs. And he. admitted the fateful meeting at a steakhouse that ended in his arrest. 'I regret not thinking about the consequences,' Hurd said, adding: 'I made some dumb, very bad decisions.' His attorneys tried to explain his claims of having high-value customers and massive demand for drugs as mere boasting, saying he had a penchant for exaggeration. One of his lawyers, Michael McCrum, called his client 'a guy showing up at a restaurant, talking stupid.' 'I think he should be punished, but for the crime that he committed,' McCrum said. Short sentence: U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis gave Hurd, pictured in 2011, a much shorter sentence than the 27 to 34 years recommended by federal sentencing guidelines. But Hurd's failed drug tests and alleged. dealings with Chavful appeared to factor heavily against him Wednesday. Prosecutors repeatedly brought up Chavful - rejecting claims by Hurd. and his attorneys that the two men were talking about Hurd's attempts to. start a T-shirt printing business. 'Normally, when you dig a hole, you quit digging,' said prosecutor John Kull. 'But he keeps digging.'Chavful and Lujan have both pleaded guilty to being involved in the conspiracy. Solis gave Chavful eight years in prison for his smaller role in the scheme. Lujan will be sentenced in January. While no other NFL players are known to have been charged in connection with the case, Hurd claimed in an interview published Tuesday by Sports Illustrated that he shared marijuana with Cowboys teammates and smoked during the last three to four years of his career 'all day, every day.' But while he gained extra notoriety due to his now-finished football career, prosecutors said Hurd's case was simple. 'He's not being prosecuted because he's an NFL player,' Kull said. 'He's being prosecuted because he's a drug dealer.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Former NFL star Sam Hurd was sentenced to 15 years in prison on charges of attempting to buy and distribute large amounts of cocaine and marijuana.

Is \\"The Sun strongly supported the April 1986 bombing of Libya by the US, which was launched from British bases.\\" a good answer to the question \\"How did The Sun feel about the American bombing of Libya in 1986?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The Sun strongly supported the April 1986 bombing of Libya by the US, which was launched from British bases.\\" effectively communicates The Sun's positive stance on the American bombing of Libya in 1986. However, to provide a more detailed and long answer, here is an elaboration that incorporates more context and analysis: In 1986, tensions between the United States and Libya were escalating due to ongoing concerns of state-sponsored terrorism and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's engagements in international conflicts. In response to the bombing of a Berlin nightclub frequented by American military personnel, which was linked to Libyan-backed terrorists, the US administration led by President Ronald Reagan decided to retaliate with military action. On April 15, 1986, US forces conducted a series of airstrikes against selected Libyan military and civilian targets – an operation codenamed El Dorado Canyon. These airstrikes were launched from British bases, as the European allies of the United States provided logistical support for the mission. The bombing was intended as a means of deterring further Libyan-backed terrorism and sending a strong message to Gaddafi. The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper, had a reputation for adopting a conservative and nationalist editorial stance. In the context of the 1986 American bombing of Libya, The Sun was notably supportive of the operation. The publication took a firm stand in favor of the mission, highlighting its perceived necessity in the fight against terrorism and the importance of maintaining a strong alliance with the United States. The Sun's editorial stance on the bombing was consistent with its support for the \\"special relationship\\" between the US and the UK, as well as its alignment with the political direction of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government. Thatcher's administration had also endorsed the United States' actions in Libya, further justifying the newspaper's pro-bombing narrative. In summary, it is accurate to say that The Sun strongly supported the April 1986 bombing of Libya by the US, as the paper backed the operation in light of ongoing threats from Libyan-sponsored terrorism and the need to preserve the alliance between the US and the UK. Backed by their conservative and nationalist leanings, The Sun's coverage of these events bolstered their support for British cooperation in the American-led mission, showcasing their endorsement of strong international counterterrorism measures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Generate a question that has the following answer: New terror cell for the following movie plot: Following the bombing of an American military installation in the Middle East (the film shows footage from the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing), the U.S. government orchestrates the capture of the mastermind believed to be behind the attack, Sheikh Ahmed bin Talal. In New York City FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Washington) and his Lebanese-American partner Frank Haddad (Shalhoub) are told of a hijacked bus, fully loaded with passengers and containing an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists manage to escape. The FBI receives demands to release the sheikh. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with CIA agent Elise Kraft (Bening). Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Afterwards another terrorist threat is made and an MTA bus is bombed, though the children on-board are permitted to leave before the bus is destroyed. When the FBI captures a person of interest named Samir Nazhde he admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. The FBI eventually identifies and storms a safehouse belonging to terrorists who are associated with the bombings. However, days later, new terror cells launch more devastating attacks, starting with the bombing of the New Victory Theater in Times Square during an evening performance. This is followed days later by a hostage situation at an elementary school (which is resolved when Hubbard shoots the hostage taker). Shortly after this, a suicide bomber drives a van full of explosives into the lobby of 1 Federal Plaza, the location of the FBI's New York City field office, resulting in over 600 fatalities.

Ms Le Pen is currently one of the top candidates for the first round of voting in April, opinion polls suggest. The National Front leader has called Mr Trump's election \\"an additional stone in the building of a new world\\". What makes Marine Le Pen far right? Ms Le Pen was seen with three men in the cafe. Agence France-Presse identified one as her partner, Louis Aliot, the National Front's (FN) vice-president. Ms Le Pen also declined to answer when asked whether her visit was personal or professional. But when asked if she would speak to pool journalists later, one of her associates said \\"OK\\". Trump team spokesperson Hope Hicks told reporters: \\"She is not meeting with anyone from our team.\\" Sean Spicer, who will be Mr Trump's press secretary, re-tweeted a post by CNN's Noah Gray that Ms Le Pen would not be meeting Mr Trump or anyone from the transition team, adding \\"Trump Tower is open to the Public\\". Ms Le Pen's campaign manager had earlier said she would not be meeting Mr Trump on her visit to New York. Ms Le Pen has herself referred to her trip as \\"private\\". Unconfirmed reports suggest the man to Ms Le Pen's right in the photo is Guido \\"George\\" Lombardi. He lives in Trump Tower, has links to a number of right-wing European parties and says he is an adviser to the Trump team, according to Politico. Reuters said the fourth man was Ms Le Pen's international affairs adviser, Ludovic De Danne. Marine Le Pen is the daughter of ex-FN leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, a convicted racist. She has denounced her father's comments and has sought to distance herself from such toxic issues as Holocaust denial. She retains a hard line on immigration and has linked it to militant Islamism. Ms Le Pen opposes the European Union, open borders and globalisation. She also says jobs, welfare, housing, schools, or any area of public provision should go to French nationals before they go to \\"foreigners\\".

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story.

UPDATED:. 03:46 EST, 1 June 2012. Deal: Boaz Weinstein is to pay 25.5 million for the Fifth Avenue apartment once owned by Huguette Clark. A U.S. finance guru who bet against JP Morgan Chase is paying 25.5million for an apartment once owned by the eccentric copper heiress Hugette Clark. Boaz Weinstein, who profited when the bank lost at least 2 billion, is paying 25.5 million for the apartment in New York's Fifth Avenue. Weinstein recently won approval from the picky co-op board at the Fifth Avenue block to go ahead with his multi-million dollar buy. 'The deal is done,' an insider told the New York Post. 'He was approved by the co-op board, which loved him. They are a lovely family. A lovely, rich family.' Mr Weinstein married his wife, Tali, in 2010. Reclusive Mrs Clark, who was 104. years old when she died last year, had not lived in the apartments for. decades. But she kept her enormous 3 million doll collection at the. prestigious address. The 5,000 square. foot, 12th floor, 14-room pre-war apartment that overlooks Central Park was listed by brokers Brown Harris Stevens at 24 million. Weinstein, the head of Saba Capital. Management, runs a 5.5 billion fund and began negotiating for the. apartment as soon as it came on the market in March. Offer: The top floor unit in Fifth Avenue was listed by brokers Brown Harris Stevens at 24 million in March, but looks set to go for 25.5 million. A source said to the New York Post Weinstein loves the 12th-floor apartment’s 'unique layout', the high ceilings and stunning views of Central Park. Huguette. Clark died. in May last year with an estimated fortune of 400 million. She had. spent most of the final days at a New York hospital checked in under a. pseudonym. Famously reclusive: Mrs Clark was 104-years-old when she died and had not lived in any of the apartments for decades but kept her enormous doll collection at the prestigious address. Two other co-op apartments on the eighth floor of the same Fifth Avenue building that she also owned remain on the market. There have been no offers on them since the co-op board turned down the prime minister of Qatar and his 31.5 million offer, sources said. Spacious: A floor plan shows the sold 12th floor apartment, which measures 5,000 square foot. The board had security concerns regarding his massive entourage and diplomatic immunity, the sources said. The. other two apartments Mrs Clark owned in the building are available for 19 million and. 12 million respectively. Known as apartments 8W and 8E - 8W has a view of Central Park and is described as the most liveable, while 8E does not and is described as the plainest. Wealthy family: Huguette (right) is pictured as an 11-year-old with her father and sister Andree in this 1917 photo. When she was alive the three apartments cost the Montana copper heiress 28,500 a month in co-op fees, or 342,000 a year. As well as the Fifth Avenue apartments,. the heiress owned two other mansions across the United States in Santa. Barbara, California and New Canaan, Connecticut. The property in Connecticut at 104. Dans Highway was re-listed in February of this year with Christie's. International Real Estate for 19.8 million.

Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins.

A woman found an unexploded bomb at the back of her neighbour's garden when she popped over to help out by mowing the lawn. Anne Mawdsley was just about to start cutting the grass when she found the rusty object - lying on the top of the soil. The 67-year-old recognised the device straight away and called police to the house in Formby, Merseyside, where she had been helping out while her neighbour, Amy, was at work. Unexploded: The wartime bomb, which was said to have been found on top of the soil at the bottom of the Merseyside garden. Mrs Mawdsley, who has lived in her house for 45 years, said: 'It is definitely the most remarkable thing I have ever dug up in the garden. 'I always try to help out my neighbour Amy as much as I can, and it doesn't take me long to mow my lawn so I decided to pop round and do her's while she was at work. 'I spotted it on top of the soil at the bottom of the garden, and my first thought was that it looked like a bomb. Discovery: Anne Mawdsley, who found the bomb, said it brought back memories of her parents as her father served in the military. 'She had some work men in the day before who were putting up some new fencing and posts. 'They must have dug it up and left it - one of them had been hitting it with a spade! 'They are lucky that it didn't go off. 'I asked the police to pop round, and I think they thought I was joking at first.

The green-fingered neighbour, whose father had served in the Russian Convoy when she was a child, said finding the bomb 'brought back memories' of her parents. 'I knew what it was as soon as I laid eyes on it,' she said. 'I'd seen deactivated bombs and replicas in museums before, and from watching old war films. 'I had the strangest nights sleep after I found it, and I dreamt a lot about my mother. 'I think that finding it must have triggered all of those old memories for me. 'It's amazing to think it has just been buried there all this time, and had the builders not dug up the soil, we might never have found it.' Evacuated: The back garden of the house in Formby, where the bomb was found. The street had to be cleared while experts removed the bomb to detonate it. Mrs Mawdsley's husband Bart added: 'It would be interesting to find out where it came from, and when it was dropped there. 'We've lived here for more than 40 years and it has been buried just metres away all this time. 'These houses were built in the 1920s but before that it was all just fields and farmland around here, so it makes sense.' A spokesperson from Merseyside Police said: 'We received a call that a member of the public had found what was described as a large device thought to be a World War Two bomb. 'Officers attended and the bomb disposal unit was called in to carry out a controlled explosion.' While it is not known where the bomb came from, the small RAF station of RAF Woodvale lies on the outskirts of Formby.

Not only one of the best romantic comedies of the year, but one of the best films in ages. 2. The trouble lies in the rambling narrative, Brooks' cautious direction and the cosy tone which renders the whole thing reminiscent of an extended sitcom. 3. Both funny and sad, the comedy was in the vein of Brooks' Terms of Endearment, except it was more eccentric and nuttier and in moments genuinely touching due to strong chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. 4. An inflated TV show by a sitcom creator. 5. Funny, but not a light comedy for youngsters. 6. The greatest pleasures come from the acting. 7. The movie's too long, and the direction is sometimes slack -- but the script is crammed with withering ripostes, ably delivered by Nicholson and Hunt. 8. A sporadically funny romantic comedy with all the dramatic plausibility and tonal consistency of a TV variety show. 9. The character is written as the most unlikable person one could ever meet. Despite this fact, Jack manages to make the character sympathetic. 10. The unpredictable and fresh 'As Good As It Gets' is peppered with memorable Brooks lines and physical schtick.

Positive review - appreciates the film's comedy, eccentricity, and chemistry between the lead actors. 4. Negative review - dismisses the film as an inflated TV show created by a sitcom creator. 5.

If \\"A little boy holding a yellow, plastic shovel, crouches in the sand.\\", can we conclude \\"a boy holds a shovel\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the statement \\"A little boy holding a yellow, plastic shovel, crouches in the sand,\\" we can conclude that \\"a boy holds a shovel.\\" To understand this conclusion, let's break down the original statement and examine each part in detail. 1. \\"A little boy\\": This phrase indicates that the subject of the statement is a young male child. The term \\"little\\" suggests that the child is likely below the age of adolescence. 2. \\"Holding a yellow, plastic shovel\\": The verb \\"holding\\" refers to the action of grasping, carrying, or supporting something with one's hands or arms. In this case, the object being held is specified as a \\"yellow, plastic shovel.\\" The adjectives \\"yellow\\" and \\"plastic\\" provide additional information about the shovel, namely its color and material. 3. \\"Crouches in the sand\\": This phrase describes the body position of the little boy. To \\"crouch\\" means to bend one's legs and lower the body close to the ground, typically while maintaining balance on the balls of the feet. \\"In the sand\\" provides the context for where this action is taking place, suggesting that the boy might be at a beach, playground, or some other sandy environment. Now, let's examine the conclusion \\"a boy holds a shovel\\" and see how it is derived from the original statement. 1. \\"A boy\\": This simplified subject still accurately represents the little boy in the original statement.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the school Sir Alexander Mackenzie was principal of?, using the article: Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.

Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ...

Article: Walls and wall building have played a very important role in Chinese culture. In ancient times, not only towns and villages, but also the houses and the temples within them were surrounded with walls. Also, the houses had no windows overlooking the street. Thus, walking in a city would give the feeling of wandering around a huge maze . The word \\"city\\" in Chinese also means \\"wall\\". The god of walls and mounts, whose duty was, and still is, to protect and be responsible for the welfare of the residents in these cities, villages, houses and temples. So a great and extremely hard task such as constructing a wall, which was supposed to run the length of the country, might not sound absurd . However, it is indeed a common mistake to think of the Great Wall as a single building structure, and it would also be a mistake to assume that it was built during a single dynasty. Actually, several dynasties somehow contributed to the construction of the Great Wall, the foundations of which had been laid many centuries ago. It was during the fourth and third centuries BC that warring states started building walls to protect their kingdoms, both against one another and against the northern nomads . The Great Wall played an important role in the growth of Chinese economy in history. Many settlements were established along the new border. Armies were instructed to reclaim wasteland and to plant crops there. Also, roads and canals were built. All of the work greatly helped increase the country's trade and cultural exchanges with many remote areas and also with the southern, central and western parts of Asia. Question: Why did ancient Chinese cities seem like a maze? - Because there were usually more walls than houses. - Because the outside walls of houses had no windows. - Because the word \\"city\\" means \\"wall\\". - Because there were legends about the god of walls.

Movie plot: Louise (Danielle Darrieux) is an aristocratic woman of Belle Ãpoque Paris, married to AndrÃ© (Charles Boyer), both a count and a high-ranking French army general. Louise is a beautiful, but spoiled and superficial, woman who has amassed debts due to her lifestyle. She arranges to secretly sell her costly heart-shaped diamond earrings, a wedding present from her husband, to the original jeweler, Mr RÃ©my (Jean Debucourt). Relations between Louise and AndrÃ© are companionable, but they sleep in separate beds, have no children, and AndrÃ© has a secret mistress, of whom he has recently tired. Louise disguises the disappearance of the earrings by pretending to have lost them at the opera. The search for them eventually reaches the newspapers (\\"Theft at the Theatre\\") which in turn prompts RÃ©my to go to AndrÃ© and \\"discreetly\\" offer to sell them back. He accepts cheerfully and, rather than confront his wife, coolly gifts the earrings to his mistress, Lola (Lia Di Leo), whom he happens to be seeing off permanently to Constantinople. At her destination, however, Lola soon sells the earrings herself to settle gambling debts and they are later purchased by an Italian baron, Fabrizio Donati (Vittorio De Sica), who is on his way to a high diplomatic post in Paris. Through a series of encounters, Donati becomes infatuated with Louise, later dancing with her long into the night at a ball. AndrÃ©'s long absence \\"on maneuvers\\" facilitates the couple's affair. With each passage of time, the Baron asks Louise if she has heard from her husband. AndrÃ©'s return prompts Louise to stop seeing Donati, but during a hunting excursion where all three are present, she witnesses Donati fall from his horse and faints. She is said to have a \\"weak heart,\\" but AndrÃ© sees this behavior as an affectation, and the event makes him suspicious.

These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"To answer the question \\"How does RNA and DNA bind more?\\", we must first understand the concept of gene regulation in the context of transcription. Transcription is the process by which genetic information stored in DNA is transcribed into RNA. Gene regulation plays a crucial role in determining how and when this transcription occurs. The passage you provided explains that genes can have regulatory regions positioned many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame. These regulatory regions act by binding to transcription factors, which are proteins that control the rate of transcription. When a transcription factor binds to a regulatory sequence, the DNA loops so that the regulatory sequence and the bound transcription factor come into close proximity with the RNA polymerase binding site. There are two types of regulatory sequences mentioned in this passage: enhancers and silencers, both of which contribute to how RNA and DNA bind more. 1. Enhancers: Enhancers are regulatory sequences that increase transcription by binding to an activator protein. The activator protein helps recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter. RNA polymerase is an enzyme responsible for synthesizing RNA from the DNA template, and promoters are specific DNA sequences where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. By bringing the activator protein and RNA polymerase closer together, the DNA loop helps facilitate the interaction between these two entities, resulting in increased binding between RNA and DNA during transcription. 2. Silencers: Silencers, on the other hand, are regulatory sequences that decrease transcription by binding to repressor proteins. These repressor proteins make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase, hindering the RNA polymerase's ability to bind to the DNA template and start transcription. This reduces the interaction or binding between RNA and DNA. To summarize, the binding between RNA and DNA can be increased or decreased through the actions of enhancer and silencer regulatory sequences. By interacting with transcription factors such as activator and repressor proteins, these regulatory sequences help modulate the looping of the DNA, which in turn influences the proximity of RNA polymerase to the promoter. Ultimately, this affects the rate of RNA and DNA binding during the transcription process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Spain and Luxembourg currently have monarchs of the House of Bourbon. The royal Bourbons originated in 1272 when the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon married the youngest son of King Louis IX. The house continued for three centuries as a cadet branch, while more senior Capetians ruled France, until Henry IV became the first Bourbon king of France in 1589. Bourbon monarchs then united to France the small kingdom of Navarre, which Henry's father had acquired by marriage in 1555, ruling both until the 1792 overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution. Restored briefly in 1814 and definitively in 1815 after the fall of the First French Empire, the senior line of the Bourbons was finally overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830. A cadet Bourbon branch, the House of Orléans, then ruled for 18 years (1830–1848), until it too was overthrown. The Princes de Condé were a cadet branch of the Bourbons descended from an uncle of Henry IV, and the Princes de Conti were a cadet branch of the Condé. Both houses were prominent French noble families well known for their participation in French affairs, even during exile in the French Revolution, until their respective extinctions in 1830 and 1814.

So,","completion":"So, there are distinguishing features in both of their outfits that tell a lot about their unique styles and personalities. Amy's shorter skirt may suggest that she prefers a bolder, more audacious style. Short skirts are often associated with a kind of fashion-forward audacity, a willingness to push boundaries and step outside of comfort zones. Amy's style choice here, therefore, might imply a strong self-confidence and an enjoyment of being the center of attention. The cut and length of her skirt could also be indicative of the environment or the occasion. For instance, if it's a hot summer day, a shorter skirt would be more suitable as it allows for more airflow and helps keep cool. At a more casual event, this choice of dress would also stand out more, creating a vibrant and lively image. Possibly, Amy's choice of a shorter skirt can convey her flirtatious and playful side. Short skirts, which often highlight the legs, are generally considered flirtatious. They are seen as a little more fun and out-going, compared to longer skirts. In contrast, Victoria's longer skirt might suggest a more conservative or traditional approach to style, reflecting a kind of understated elegance. Longer skirts often come off as more formal and sophisticated, demonstrating an aspiration towards a classic aesthetic. This attire might indicate that Victoria prefers subtly drawing attention rather than explicitly seeking it. Victoria’s longer skirt could also mean she favors comfort and free movement over all else. Longer skirts are generally more comfortable and less restrictive, making them suitable for a variety of activities. Additionally, if the event they're attending is more formal, then a longer skirt would be a standard choice as it fits the decorum and seriousness of the occasion. Moreover, Victoria’s longer skirt might symbolize her more reserved and modest personality. Longer skirts provide more coverage and are typically associated with modesty. This might indicate that Victoria prefers not revealing too much and keeping things elegant and refined. Thus, the contrasting lengths of Amy and Victoria's skirts do more than differentiate their physical appearances - they provide subtle cues to their individual tastes, personalities, and perhaps even their attitudes towards life. Personal style is a form of self-expression, and the manner in which Amy and Victoria choose to present themselves can reveal as much about their characters as it does about their sartorial preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I ran the ice cube under warm water.","completion":"The sentence \\"I ran the ice cube under warm water\\" has a multitude of effects on different levels, including experiential, linguistic, and cognitive. To fully understand the impact of this sentence, let us analyze it from various perspectives. 1. Experiential effect: The sentence depicts an action that is easily relatable and understandable. It creates a sensory experience in the reader's mind, evoking the feeling of holding an ice cube and watching it being exposed to warm water. The cold sensation experienced when touching ice, the contrast of temperatures, the texture of the ice cube, and the melting process are all aspects that readers can associate with their own personal experiences. 2. Linguistic effect: From a linguistic perspective, the sentence is simple and concise, consisting of a subject (I), a verb (ran), and a direct object (the ice cube). It also includes two prepositional phrases (under and warm water), which provide more context and information about the action being performed. The sentence is grammatically correct and straightforward, making it easily understood by most readers. 3. Cognitive effect: The sentence stimulates the reader's cognitive faculties, encouraging them to visualize the scene and perhaps anticipate what may happen next. As they read and process the sentence, their brain might create a mental image of the action happening in real-time, complete with the sensory details of touch, temperature, and sight. This cognitive engagement can foster a deeper understanding of the concept and make the text more memorable. 4. Thematic effect: Although the sentence is simple, it can convey different themes, depending on the reader's perceptions. For instance, the sentence might be interpreted as a metaphor, symbolizing the idea of vulnerability under pressure or warmth helping to remove personal barriers. Alternatively, it could be seen as a representation of the power of change, as the ice cube transitions from a solid to a liquid form. The thematic meanings underpinning the sentence add depth and complexity to the reader's understanding of the text. 5. Emotional effect: Depending on the context, the phrase could evoke different emotions in the reader. If it is part of a larger narrative or dialogue, its emotional impact might vary based on the characters' circumstances, their relationships, or the events preceding the action. The reader may feel empathy, curiosity, satisfaction, or even nostalgia as the sentence prompts memories and associations with their own experiences involving ice cubes and warm water. In conclusion, the sentence \\"I ran the ice cube under warm water\\" creates a multi-faceted effect – experiential, linguistic, cognitive, thematic, and emotional – on the reader, which testifies to the power of language to convey information, stimulate the senses, and evoke thought and emotion.

It was 3:30 in the morning and 8-year-old Walt Disney was doing what he did at that time every morning- rolling hundreds of newspapers he would soon deliver in his neighborhood. It was hard work for a little kid who had to go to school, then deliver another round in the evening. But delivering papers beat picking apples for a living. That's what he'd been doing before, on his family's failing farms in Missouri. Walt Disney, born in December, 1901, never had time for a childhood.

Given the following context: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

Kellie: Yes, and you know what they say, \\"A friend who can be silent with you in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with you in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing… not healing, not curing.. that is a friend who cares.\\" I feel like that's what's missing in today's friendships because of the influence of social media. Colin: I couldn't have said it better. It's really worrying that these superficial connections are replacing genuine, heartfelt friendships. People don't seem to have the patience and understanding for one another that they used to have. Kellie: In a way, I think it's even affecting our self-esteem and sense of self-worth. If our relationships are based on likes and comments, it's no wonder we're constantly seeking validation from others. We end up measuring our value by how many friends or followers we have, rather than who we truly are and the depth of our relationships. Colin: Not to mention how this constant bombardment of other people's highlight reels makes us feel inadequate and envious. It breeds a toxic environment of comparison and competition, instead of solidarity and support. No wonder so many of us feel isolated and lonely, even though we're more \\"connected\\" than ever before. Kellie: I think the big question is, how do we reverse this? How do we bring back the depth and quality of human relations that we used to have? Is it even possible in this age of social media? Colin: I believe it is. It's just a matter of being mindful of our actions and prioritizing face-to-face interactions. We could limit our time on social media, make a conscious effort to be present in the moment when we're with others, and not be afraid to cultivate vulnerability in our relationships. Kellie: I agree. We need to remember that there's more to life than what we see on our screens. Creating real connections with people can bring so much more joy and fulfillment than any number of likes, comments, or followers ever could. Colin: Let's lead by example! Starting today, let's make a point of putting away our phones when we're together, and really engaging with one another. And who knows? Maybe our actions will inspire others to take a step back from social media and rediscover the power of true human connection. Kellie: I'm in! Let's make a positive change and bring back the depth and warmth of genuine human relations that seem to have been lost. It's time to put people first, not social media."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Your gifts and talents will help you succeed, but they can only do so if you know what they are. You need to be self-aware enough to use and hone the gifts you already have. Start by thinking about the areas in which you excel. What comes easiest to you? In which subjects did you always do well in school? What do you breeze through at work? Ask your friends, family, and co-workers for feedback. Often, they can see talents that you're blind to. For instance, maybe you have a natural ability to talk anyone into anything. You may not even notice that ability, yet it's a skill that comes in handy in many fields. You could ask your friends, \\"I'm trying to become more self-aware. Can you tell me what you think my strengths and weaknesses are?\\" It's also equally important to know your challenges, so you can work on those areas. Listen when you do receive feedback from others, either solicited or unsolicited, as that will help you learn where you can grow. For example, if a friend says, \\"You're starting another new project? What happened to the last one?\\" you may realize that you aren't following through on your projects. Studies have shown that kids who are praised for their effort rather than for the result are more likely to develop a growth mindset. That's because they become focused on the process rather than the the end result. You can use that to your own benefit by rewarding yourself for your hard work, rather than just the end result. For every designated length of time that you work on something, reward yourself with a fun break or treat. This can help keep your focus on the effort. Or if you tried a new recipe at home, something you find difficult, you probably would normally tell yourself, \\"That's so delicious!\\" While that's not bad necessarily, you should also think about the process, telling yourself, \\"I'm proud of myself for trying out a new recipe and working so hard on it.\\" A qualified counselor or therapist can help you identify negative thinking patterns and other roadblocks toward developing a growth mindset. A therapist can make an assessment of your personal relationships, your professional development, and personal experiences. They can also give you \\"tools\\" to combat negative thoughts, improve your self esteem, and offer support when you experience setbacks. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of self-awareness in identifying and utilizing one's gifts and talents to achieve success, as well as seeking feedback from others to understand one's strengths and weaknesses.

The film begins with the first page of the book, talking about rumors of a mysterious sea monster that prowled the South Seas in 1868. The camera switches to an old-fashioned ship sailing through apparently calm seas. A long, dark object with glowing lights like eyes at its head appears a short distance away from the ship. It drives straight toward the ship, making a loud whirring noise of a motor. It collides head-on with the ship, sinking it, and sails off. A man standing before a crowd in San Francisco offers a bonus to any man who will ship with an expedition to hunt the mysterious \\"monster\\". Another man interrupts him, warning the crowd not to sign; they will never make it back to collect their pay. He brings up an elderly seaman who tells a dramatic story of how the \\"monster\\" sunk the ship he was on, and proceeds to give a vivid description of the monster.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Walter Wetzel had met Ryan Lamantia nearly eight years ago in a hospital waiting room. Both were very sick----Ryan with brain cancer, Walter with leukemia . Ryan, who was 3 at the time, began making silly faces at Walter and chatted about going home to change into his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles costume. Several days later, Ryan moved to another hospital. Though they saw each other only a handful of times after that, Walter never forgot Ryan. \\"He inspired me to fight against my cancer,\\" said Walter, now 17, a football player. Then one day, Walter saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt at a mall, which made him decide to search out Ryan. Back home, Walter typed in \\"Ryan Lake in the Hills brain cancer\\" on his computer, and a link to a Facebook page for Ryan came up. But, the news was shocking. Ryan had died on Sept. 8, 2005. He was 6. The Facebook page was for the Ryan Lamantia Foundation, a non-profit organization that Ryan's family formed after his death to raise money for brain cancer research. Walter left this message right away: .\\"Ryan is my hero. My trips to the hospital were always horrible, until the day I met Ryan.\\" Ryan's mom's eyes were filled with tears as she read Waiter's message. \\"We always knew Ryan was special, but to hear it from somebody else, it really means the world to us,\\" Lamantia said. Walter wasn't the only person who was greatly impressed with Ryan. \\"He was a little superhero,\\" said Wendy Stellpflug, a nurse at Children' s Memorial Hospital. \\"Ryan always kept his spirits high, even after he suffered hearing loss and experienced 14 operations.\\" \\"Ryan didn' t let his illness stop him. He always had a smile on his face,\\" said Dr. Stewart Goldman, the doctor who treated Ryan. Walter and his family have been in touch with the Lamantias for the past few weeks. And last week, they met for the first time since Ryan's death. The families told stories of being affected by cancer so young and Walter expressed his hope to volunteer with Ryan' s foundation.

Options: A: he saw the news about Ryan on the Internet B: he wanted to thank Ryan in person C: an object reminded him of Ryan D: he raised money for Ryan A:","completion":"C: an object reminded him of Ryan Step-by-step justification: 1.

This memory of Ryan compelled Walter to search out Ryan online, ultimately leading to the discovery of the Ryan Lamantia Foundation and the news of Ryan's death. 3.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I read this background article the other day: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. I am facing a new situation today: Mike is a physician who treats HIV-infected patients. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A is infected with HIV, but patient B is not infected with HIV. Mike is trying to figure out how HIV-infected patient is different from the patient who is not infected with HIV. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which patient has lower chance of developing infections, patient A or patient B? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, an individual with HIV has a compromised immune system due to the decreasing number of helper T cells. The immune system's ability to defend the body from infections gets weaker as the number of T cells declines. Since patient A is infected with HIV and patient B is not, we can deduce the following differences: 1. Patient A (HIV-infected) is likely to have a higher number of HIV copies in their body, continually replicating and destroying helper T cells. As a result, their immune system is weaker and less capable of fending off infections. 2. Patient B (not HIV-infected) does not have the HIV virus in their body, and therefore their helper T cells are not being destroyed by the virus. Their immune system remains functional and more capable of defending against infections. Considering the mentioned differences, patient B, who is not infected with HIV, has a lower chance of developing infections compared to patient A, who is infected with HIV. This is because patient B's immune system is not compromised by the virus and can mount a better defense against infections. It is essential to note that this comparison is specific to the context of HIV; other factors may influence an individual's susceptibility to infections, such as underlying health conditions, genetics, and lifestyle factors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is considered one of the founding fathers of reggaeton and the Father of Rap. Vico C has played an influential role in the development of Latin American hip hop. - Planeta Kumbia (English: \\"Kumbia Planet\\") is the second studio album by the cumbia band A.B. Quintanilla y Los Kumbia All Starz. It was released on March 4, 2008 through EMI Latin. The record is A.B.

It has all the songs from the standard edition plus two more songs and the music videos for \\"Chiquilla\\", \\"Parece Que Va a Llover\\", and \\"Speedy Gonzales\\". - Los Kumbia All Starz are a Mexican-American cumbia group from Corpus Christi, Texas, created by A.B. Quintanilla. Kumbia All Starz are not to be confused with Los Kumbia Kings although some members are originally from Los Kumbia Kings. Their 2006 debut album \\"Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz\\" reached number one on United States Billboard's Latin Pop Albums chart, number one on the Top Latin Albums chart, and number sixty-eight on the United States \\"Billboard\\" 200.

It began as a courtship dance practiced among the African population on the Caribbean coasts of Colombia and Panama. It later mixed with Amerindian and European instruments, steps and musical characteristics and spread throughout Latin America and abroad. While other genres of Latin American music have remained associated with specific countries or regions, cumbia has grown to be one of the most widespread and unifying musical genres to emerge from Latin America. - \`\` Rica y Apretadita '' is a song by Panamanian reggae singer El General featuring Anayca . The song was released in 1995 and is one of El General 's signature songs . \`\` Rica y Apretadita '' was later cover by Mexican - American cumbia group A.B. Quintanilla y Los Kumbia All Starz featuring Mexican - American singer Melissa Jiménez . It was released on May 20 , 2008 as the second single from their second studio album Planeta Kumbia ( 2008 ) . Ricky Rick and Melissa Jiménez provide the vocals . - Edgardo Armando Franco, better known as El General, is a Panamanian reggae artist considered by some to be one of the fathers of \\"Reggae En Español\\". During the early 1990s, he initiated the Spanish spoken dancehall. Early examples of this were the international and somewhat mainstream songs, Te Ves Buena and Tu Pun Pun. Both songs, performed in Spanish rap, were very successful in North America. After getting his foot in the door of the commercial market, many other Spanish rappers became famous in the mainstream as well, such as Vico C and DJ Negro. He has a unique, easy to listen to style of dance music and has produced many well-known songs all over Latin America. His musical works have become popular in Latin America over the last few years. This style is called Reggae en Español, because he makes dancehall reggae music with Spanish-language lyrics. - Los Kumbia Kings was an American Mexican cumbia group from Corpus Christi, Texas, created by A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martinez. Their music encompasses the styles of cumbia (hence their name), hip hop, and R&B. They produce songs in both Spanish and English. The band's producers from the beginning have been Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez. Quintanilla is the brother of the late \\"Queen of Tejano\\", Selena. Quintanilla played bass guitar for the group, while Martínez, husband of international artist Alicia Villarreal, played keyboards. Both co-wrote songs for the Kumbia Kings. Though the group has gone through a revolving door of members in recent years amid controversy and finger-pointing, and the Kumbia Kings of today are vastly different from what originated in Corpus Christi over eight years ago, Quintanilla and Martínez were always the soul of the group. Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\". Quintanilla, Irvin \\"Pee Wee\\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris Pérez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \\"internal dissension\\". Martínez kept Los Kumbia Kings but changed the name to Los Super Reyes for legal issues. In October 2009, Quintanilla and Martínez solved their differences, and announced that the Kumbia Kings would reunite for a series of concerts lasting from late 2009 through early 2010. - Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s. Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. Two of the biggest stars of the early dancehall era were Yellowman and Eek-a-Mouse. Dancehall brought a new generation of producers, including Linval Thompson, Gussie Clarke and Jah Thomas. In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or \\"ragga\\") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. (The word \\"bashment\\", a term originating in the 1990s, was used to describe a particularly good dance; for example \\"to go to a bashment dance\\". In the Dancehall vernacular, \\"bashment\\" is therefore an adjective instead of a noun.) - Reggae en Español (in English, Spanish Reggae) is reggae and dancehall music recorded in the Spanish language by artists of Latin American origin. It originated in the mid-1970s in Panama. \\"Reggae en Español\\" goes by several names: In Panama it is called \\"La Plena\\". - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Earth Crisis is an American metalcore band from Syracuse, New York, active from 1989 until 2001, reuniting in 2007. Since 1993 the band's longest serving members are vocalist Karl Buechner, guitarist Scott Crouse, bassist Ian Edwards and drummer Dennis Merrick. Their third guitarist Erick Edwards joined the band in 1998. The band has released eight studio albums, three compilations, two live albums and six music videos. The name of the band, Earth Crisis, indicates how their members see the current state of the planet and in their lyrics they seek to offer solutions to it; these are either \\"educational\\" or encourage direct-action. Most of them focus on rejection of recreational drugs, animal products, animal testing, industrial livestock production, illegal drug trade and an impending earth's doom caused by wars or an ecological collapse. On the other hand, they promote straight edge, veganism, self-empowerment and organizations such as Earth First!, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and the Animal Liberation Front. In the words of the academic Jonathan Pieslak, some of their lyrics \\"read like passages\\" taken from \\"direct-action essays\\" of these institutions. Other subjects include criticism against white supremacy and, especially on Breed the Killers, oppressive governments. 2000's record Slither incorporated more topical issues, such as genetic engineering and second amendment rights. Their seventh and eighth albums, Neutralize the Threat and Salvation of Innocents, are concept albums entirely dedicated to real-life vigilantes and animal rights/anti-vivisection, respectively. The albums All Out War, Gomorrah's Season Ends and Breed the Killers included essays that delve into their lyrics and beliefs. According to the sociologist Ross Haenfler, Earth Crisis combined \\"youth crew's outspoken commitment to straight edge with Manliftingbanner's direct politics\\". In a 1998 interview with Roadrunner Records, Karl Buechner described Earth Crisis' philosophy: \\"I want to boil it down to one notion: personal accountability. Respect for yourself, respect for the lives of innocent beings around us.\\" He added that \\"Just being drug-free doesn't make you a good person, you need to use that clarity of the mind to become actively involved in the struggle that is being waged for earth, human and animal liberation.\\" Their message disjoined from the \\"posicore\\" attitudes in its advocation for violent direct action. However, they believe that it must be used only as a last resort: \\"destruction and violence are the last thing I want to see but tragically, they are sometimes necessary. We place so far greater value on the lives of the innocent beings than any type of worth that could be put upon someone who's sadistic or greedy and doesn't want to change their profit system\\", said Buechner. The band cited authors Peter Singer, John Robbins and Huey P. Newton as inspirations. In their live shows, there is usually literature about PETA, Greenpeace and others distributed. They have been longtime supporters for organizations such as the Animal Defense League, having done several benefit concerts for them. Nevertheless, they are not part of any of these groups or a political party: \\"We're about things we're interested in and we sing about things that happen politically, but we're not left-core or right wing. We don't want to get tangled up in someone else's agenda, which can happen if you join up in certain organizations.\\" Earth Crisis was occasionally misidentified with the hardline subculture, but they are not against homosexuality and believe that abortion should remain as an option in some instances. They also do not have a religious agenda and think that that is mainly a personal choice. what were their views","completion":"Earth Crisis, a metalcore band from Syracuse, New York, had a strong focus on addressing the current state of the planet and advocating for various solutions in their lyrics. Their views primarily centered around environmentalism, animal rights, and social issues. Some of their main beliefs and causes included: 1. Rejection of recreational drugs, animal products, animal testing, and industrial livestock production. They also condemned the illegal drug trade and warned against impending doom due to wars or ecological collapse. 2. Promotion of straight edge, veganism, self-empowerment, and support for organizations such as Earth First!, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and the Animal Liberation Front. They believed in taking direct action and personal accountability for oneself and the environment. 3. Criticism of white supremacy and oppressive governments, addressing these issues in their album Breed the Killers. 4. Addressing topical issues like genetic engineering and second amendment rights, as seen in their 2000 album Slither. 5. Advocating for animal rights and anti-vivisection through their concept albums Neutralize the Threat and Salvation of Innocents. 6. Understanding that while being drug-free is important, it doesn't necessarily make one a good person, thus emphasizing the need for active involvement in the struggle for earth, human, and animal liberation. 7. Accepting violent direct action as a last resort, valuing the lives of innocent beings over the worth of sadistic or greedy individuals who do not wish to change their profit system. 8. Drawing inspiration from authors such as Peter Singer, John Robbins, and Huey P. Newton. They regularly distributed literature from organizations like PETA and Greenpeace during their live shows. 9. Supporting organizations like the Animal Defense League through benefit concerts, but not being affiliated with any specific group or political party, as they did not want to be entangled in someone else's agenda. 10. While occasionally misidentified with the hardline subculture, Earth Crisis clarified that they were not against homosexuality and believed that abortion should remain an option in some instances. They also held the view that religion was mainly a personal choice and did not tie it to their core beliefs. In summary, Earth Crisis' views focused on addressing environmental, animal rights, and social issues through their music and activism. They promoted personal accountability and direct action while remaining unaffiliated with specific political parties or organizations to avoid being caught up in someone else's agenda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do that, we'll add 43 * j to both sides. So, it will look like this: 816 = -94 * j + 43 * j Now, let's combine the j terms on the right side. To add -94 * j and 43 * j, we subtract 43 from -94, which is -51: 816 = -51 * j Next, we need to find the value of j.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who agreed to a trial? is inside the article: Drake began recording his debut album Five Leaves Left later in 1968, with Boyd as producer. Drake skipped lectures to travel by train to the sessions in Sound Techniques studio, London. Inspired by John Simon's production of Leonard Cohen's album Songs of Leonard Cohen, Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, \\"with no shiny pop reverb\\". He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, \\"without overwhelming ... or sounding cheesy\\". To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London folk rock scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson (no relation). To provide string arrangements, Boyd already had in mind Richard A. Hewson. Initial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention's production of their Unhalfbricking album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of George Martin's approach of \\"using the studio as an instrument\\", while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann has observed that Drake appears \\"tight and anxious\\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation. Both were unhappy with Hewson's contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs. Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement. Though Boyd was sceptical about taking on an inexperienced amateur music student, he was impressed by Drake's uncharacteristic assertiveness, and agreed to a trial. Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs. While Kirby provided most arrangements for the album, its centrepiece \\"River Man\\", which echoed the tone of Delius, was orchestrated by the veteran composer Harry Robertson. Post-production difficulties delayed the release by several months, and the album was poorly marketed and supported. In July, Melody Maker described Five..., can you guess it ?

Write a question about the following article: Mohács is seen by many Hungarians as the decisive downward turning point in the country's history, a national trauma that persists in the nation's folk memory. For moments of bad luck, Hungarians still say: \\"more was lost at Mohács\\" . Hungarians view Mohács as marking the end of an independent and powerful European nation. Whilst Mohács was a decisive loss, it was the aftermath that truly put an end to independent Hungary. The ensuing two hundred years of near constant warfare between the two empires, Habsburg and Ottoman, turned Hungary into a perpetual battlefield. The countryside was regularly ravaged by armies moving back and forth, in turn devastating the population. Only in the 19th century would Hungary regain some degree of autonomy, with full independence coming only after the First World War; however, the Treaty of Trianon awarded much of its former land to other states , and Hungary has never regained its former political power. In the 464 years from 1525 to 1989, Hungary spent the vast majority of the time under the direct or indirect domination of a foreign power. These foreign powers were, successively, the Ottoman Empire , the Holy Roman Empire , the Austrian Empire , and the Soviet Union ; furthermore, between 1867 and 1918 Hungary was widely considered the \\"junior\\" partner in the Austro-Hungarian Empire: autonomy was granted, but stopped well short of independence. The battlefield, beside the village of Sátorhely, became an official national historical memorial site in 1976 on the 450th anniversary of the battle. The memorial was designed by architect György Vadász. A new reception hall and exhibition building, also designed by Vadász and partially funded by the European Union, was completed in 2011.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that wrote the Recondita armonia in a high B flat?, using the article: The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the \\"fugitive\\" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first of the \\"Grand Tunes\\", Cavaradossi's \\"Recondita armonia\\" with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the \\"fugitive\\" motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation.

When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent...","completion":"The name of the person whose march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 men was Perdiccas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mounted the sending unit next to my glass rain gauge. After our first rain, both the mechanical and new La Crosse gauges were identical. In the instructions it says to remove the battery to clear the 24 hr reading. When I did that I would loose the signal from the sending unit and have to go through the setup again. I found out that if you only reset the top display the 24 hr will re-zero in 24 hrs. Works for me. Love mine and the price is really reasonable to not have to empty after each rain. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a simple, inexpensive rain gauge. Answer:","completion":"Based on the review provided, the customer seems to be satisfied with the product.

Question: Who is the actor playing George Bailey? Movie title: It's a Wonderful Life Movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S. Hinds), with a small staff including Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls. They face a difficult battle with the evil, avaricious, and wealthy Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Potter is on the board of directors of the Building and Loan, holds much of its assets, along with almost everything else in town, charges people exorbitant rent on his own apartments,...

Several Republicans dissented.","completion":"Although the word \\"dissent\\" appears in both sentences and shares a common underlying meaning, there are slight differences in the context and manner in which it is used in these two sentences. \\"Dissent\\" generally refers to the act of expressing disagreement or resistance, often with respect to a point of view or an official decision. In both sentences, \\"dissent\\" conveys this sense of disagreement, but within different contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Dissent to the laws of the country,\\" the phrase suggests a broader disagreement with or opposition to the established laws within a nation. In this context, \\"dissent\\" refers to the act of not conforming or adhering to the rules or regulations established by the government or governing body of a country. The disagreement here is against a more comprehensive set of policies or legal frameworks. In contrast, in the second sentence, \\"Several Republicans dissented,\\" the use of \\"dissent\\" implies that a specific group of individuals (in this case, several Republicans) expressed disagreement or opposition in a particular situation, likely within a political context. Here, the dissent is not against the laws or framework of a nation as a whole, but rather against a particular decision, policy, or opinion. This could relate to a vote on a bill, a stance on a particular issue, or even a disagreement within the Republican party itself. In summary, while the word \\"dissent\\" in both sentences retains its core meaning of expressing disagreement or opposition, it differs in terms of context and scope. The first sentence describes a more general disagreement with the laws of a country, while the second sentence refers to a specific group of individuals expressing dissent in a particular situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We decided to investigate further and document our findings,\\" Matt continued. Mr. Swartz looked intrigued. \\"The Timbisha petroglyphs are indeed a fascinating subject, and your discovery of an erratic rock in that area is quite interesting. Erratics are rocks that have been transported by glaciers or other means and then deposited in an environment different from their origin. They stand out because their geological composition, size, and shape don't match the native rocks around them,\\" Mr. Swartz began to explain. \\"In the northwestern portion of the Mojave Desert, several geological processes could be at play in placing an erratic rock amidst the desert landscape. You see, the Mojave Desert itself is a product of different geological events, such as volcanic activity, faulting, and erosion, over millions of years. That's why it has such a diverse and unique landscape,\\" he continued. \\"One possibility is that the erratic rock you found was transported there by ice during the Pleistocene epoch when glaciers covered the nearby Sierra Nevada mountain range. When the ice melted, the glaciers retreated, leaving behind the rocks they carried from the mountains. It's not uncommon for erratics to be found in areas that were once glaciated.\\" \\"Another possibility is that the rock was carried there by a flood or debris flow originating from nearby mountain ranges. These events can move large boulders and deposit them in valleys and basins, such as those in the Mojave Desert. This is especially likely if the rock you found was located near a riverbed or drainage basin.\\" \\"Lastly, the erratic rock could have been displaced by tectonic activity. The Mojave Desert is situated near the boundaries of the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate. The movements and interactions between these plates have caused significant deformation and displacement of rocks in the area over millions of years. One such geological feature in the area is the Garlock Fault, which could potentially have played a role in the movement of the rock.\\" Matt listened attentively to Mr. Swartz's explanation. \\"That's really fascinating, Mr. Swartz. I had no idea there were so many possibilities for how the rock could have ended up there. I'm going to do more research and see if I can pinpoint the most likely reason.\\" \\"I'm glad you're so enthusiastic about this, Matt. Studying geological processes and their effects on the landscape can lead to a better understanding of Earth's history and help us appreciate our planet's incredible complexity,\\" Mr. Swartz concluded. Encouraged by his teacher's words, Matt decided to delve deeper into the study of geology and uncover the mystery surrounding the erratic rock he discovered in the Mojave Desert. His group documented their investigation, and their work ultimately contributed to a greater understanding of the region's geological history. Matt's curiosity and passion for knowledge had led him to make a significant discovery about the intriguing and ever-evolving landscape of the Mojave Desert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Naypyidaw is the capital of which Asian country?","completion":"Naypyidaw, also spelled Nay Pyi Taw, is the capital city of Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. Myanmar is strategically located in the region sharing borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Laos, and Thailand. Covering an area of 7,054 square kilometers, Naypyidaw is a planned city and was constructed with the intention of replacing the former capital, Yangon, as the administrative capital of Myanmar. The official relocation of the capital occurred on November 6, 2005, when the military government in power, the State Peace and Development Council, made the decision to move the capital for numerous reasons. Some of these reasons included the government's desire to manage and centralize the administration, the vulnerability of Yangon to natural disasters like cyclones, and the belief that a more central location for the capital would promote national unity. The city is divided into several zones, such as the government zone, military zone, residential zone, and diplomatic zone. Due to its relatively recent establishment, Naypyidaw is characterized by a modern and well-planned urban infrastructure, featuring wide roads, a well-connected transportation system, and purpose-built residential areas. Some of the landmarks in the city include the monumental Presidential Palace, the Parliament building or Hluttaw complex, and numerous golf courses and hotels. In terms of tourism, Naypyidaw hasn't yet reached the levels of popularity that Yangon and other historical cities like Bagan and Mandalay enjoy. However, it does have attractions such as the Uppatasanti Pagoda, which is a replica of the sacred Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, and the National Museum which houses ancient artifacts and items indicative of Myanmar's rich cultural heritage. By building this new city and establishing it as the capital, the government of Myanmar aimed to create an efficient administrative center, strategically positioned in the heart of the country. This relocation is also indicative of Myanmar's long and complex history, which has seen several changes of political powers, social dynamics, and economic growth over the years. As the country continues to open up to the rest of the world and undergo transformations on its path to development and democratization, Naypyidaw stands as a symbol of those ongoing changes in this Southeast Asian nation."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Full of happiness and sadness, the year 2015 is coming to an end and we invite you, the foreign friends to share your stories with our millions of readers all over the world.

I am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original -- have not seen, and doubt I will. It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (Jimmy Fallon). Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. He's supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot. Not Fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells Fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she's moving on. And rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago. But of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions.

He didn't have much experience with cutting hair, but he believed his steady hands and attention to detail would be enough to give Joseph the neat trim he was looking for. Step 1: Gather the necessary tools and set up a workspace To start, Brian fetched his sharpest pair of scissors, a comb, and a spray bottle filled with water from the bathroom. He cleared off a table in the living room and draped a towel over Joseph's shoulders to catch the falling hair. Making sure Joseph was comfortably seated, Brian stood behind him, ready to begin the haircut. Step 2: Section the hair and dampen it Brian began by sectioning Joseph's hair into manageable parts using the comb. This would make it easier to work through each section systematically, ensuring a more even cut. He then spritzed Joseph's hair with water from the spray bottle, dampening it slightly to keep it under control while he trimmed it. Step 3: Establish a guideline and start cutting To ensure a consistent length, Brian combed through Joseph's hair and created a guideline at the desired length. He took a small section of hair between his fingers, pulled it taut, and snipped off the ends. Brian repeated this process, following the guideline around Joseph's head, carefully measuring and cutting each section to achieve an even trim. Step 4: Check for any uneven areas After completing the initial trim, Brian took a step back to observe his handiwork. He noticed a couple of areas where the hair appeared longer than in others. To correct this, he went back in with his scissors, carefully trimming and blending the hair until it appeared more even. Step 5: Style the hair Finally, Brian used a bit of styling product to shape Joseph's hair and give it some texture. He applied a small amount of hair paste to his fingertips, working it through Joseph's hair to create a natural, tousled look. Step 6: Clean up and ask for feedback After styling Joseph's hair, Brian carefully swept up the fallen strands, removing the towel from Joseph's shoulders and shaking it outside. He then asked Joseph to take a look at the final result in the mirror to make sure they were both satisfied with the trim. Joseph seemed pleasantly surprised by the outcome and thanked Brian for his help. As a first-time haircutter, Brian felt a sense of achievement and was glad he could help his friend look and feel better with a simple trim."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sleep debt is the difference between the amount of sleep you should be getting and the amount you actually get.It's a deficit that grows every time we skim some extra minutes off our nightly sleep.\\"People accumulate sleep debt gradually without being noticed,\\"says William C.Dement,founder of the Stanford University Sleep Clinic.Studies show that such short--term sleep deprivation leads to a foggy brain,worsened vision,and trouble remembering. Long-term effects include obesity,insulin resistance, and heart disease. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation reports that we're losing one hour of sleep each night----more than two full weeks of sleep every year. The good news is that,like all debt, with some work,sleep debt can be repaid. Adding an extra hour or two of sleep a night is the way to catch up.For the long--term lack of sleep,take it easy for a few months to get back into a natural sleep pattern. Go to bed when you are tired,and allow your body to wake you in the morning(no alarm clock allowed).You may find yourself catatonic in the beginning of the recovery cycle:expect to have ten hours shut-eye per night. As the days pass, however,the amount of sleeping time will gradually decrease. So earn back that lost sleep----and follow the dictates of your innate sleep needs.

Verity Ann Lambert (27 November 1935 - 22 November 2007) was an English television and film producer. She was the founding producer of the science-fiction series Doctor Who and she had a long association with Thames Television. Her many credits include Adam Adamant Lives! Later in 1974 Lambert became Head of Drama at Thames Television. During her time in this position she oversaw several high-profile and successful contributions to the ITV network, including The Naked Civil Servant (1975), Rock Follies (1976-77), Rumpole of the Bailey (1978-92) and Edward and Mrs Simpson (1978). In 1976 she was also made responsible for overseeing the work of Euston Films, Thames' subsidiary film production company, at the time best known as the producers of The Sweeney. In 1979 she transferred to Euston full-time as the company's Chief Executive, overseeing productions such as Quatermass (1979), Minder (1979-94) and Widows (1983). At Thames and Euston, Lambert enjoyed the most sustained period of critical and popular success of her career. The Naked Civil Servant won a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for its star John Hurt as well as a Broadcasting Press Guild Award and a prize at the Prix Italia; Rock Follies won a BAFTA and a Royal Television Society Award, while Widows also gained BAFTA nominations and ratings of over 12 million--unusually for a drama serial, it picked up viewers over the course of its six-week run. Minder went on to become the longest-running series produced by Euston Films, surviving for over a decade following Lambert's departure from the company. Television historian Lez Cooke described Lambert's time in control of the drama department at Thames as \\"an adventurous period for the company, demonstrating that it was not only the BBC that was capable of producing progressive television drama during the 1970s. Lambert wanted Thames to produce drama series 'which were attempting in one way or another to tackle modern problems and life,' an ambition which echoed the philosophy of her mentor Sydney Newman.\\" Howard Schuman, the writer of Rock Follies, also later praised the bravery of Lambert's commissioning. \\"Verity Lambert had just arrived as head of drama at Thames TV and she went for broke,\\" he told The Observer newspaper in 2002. \\"She commissioned a serial, Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill, for safety, but also Bill Brand, one of the edgiest political dramas ever, and us ... Before we had even finished making the first series, Verity commissioned the second.\\" Lambert's association with Thames and Euston Films continued into the 1980s. In 1982, she rejoined the staff of parent company Thames Television as director of drama, and was given a seat on the company's board. In November 1982 she left Thames, but remained as chief executive at Euston until leaving in November of the following year to take up her first post in the film industry, as director of production for Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment. Her job here was somewhat frustrating as the British film industry was in one of its periodic states of flux, but she did produce several feature films, including Clockwise (1986). Lambert later expressed some regret on her time in the film industry in a feature for The Independent newspaper. \\"Unfortunately, the person who hired me left, and the person who came in didn't want to produce films and didn't want me. While I managed to make some films I was proud of--Dennis Potter's Dreamchild, and Clockwise with John Cleese--it was terribly tough and not a very happy experience.\\" Lambert was Chair of the British Film Institute Production Board from 1981-82.","completion":"This text is about Verity Ann Lambert, an English television and film producer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows. He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed \\"Mr...

A. communicating B. response C. yelling D. hanging up E. whisper The best answer is Answer:","completion":"E. whisper In the given scenario, the individual had to make a call in the middle of the night and faced difficulty in communication. This suggests that they were trying not to disturb anyone who might be asleep or they were in a situation where silence was necessary. Under such circumstances, the best way to communicate would be by whispering. Whispering allows for a discreet mode of conversation, keeping the noise level to a minimum while still being able to convey the message. Whispering is a technique of vocalization that produces very soft sound waves with minimal intensity. It is a versatile method of communication – employed in situations where loud speaking would be inappropriate or unwelcome – and has evolved as a form of communication in various contexts, including maintaining secrecy, conveying confidential information, and protecting one's privacy. Option A, communicating, is not the best answer because it is a general term that does not specify the required mode of communication in this scenario. Options B, response, and D, hanging up, are unrelated to the actual communication act during the call. Option C, yelling, is opposite to what would be an appropriate form of communication in this case, as yelling would create a disturbance and likely wake those around or draw unwanted attention. Therefore, of the given options, E. whisper is the most appropriate answer in this context, as it best describes the method of communication that the individual would employ to discreetly make the call in the middle of the night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He falls in love with Marjorie Waddell, a young woman ten years his junior. However, he is under constant pressure to enlist, especially from Waddell's father. He has the opportunity to do so when the British Army forms the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company to supplement the Royal Engineers; Woodward is commissioned to lead the unit. On the Western Front, Woodward meets Frank Tiffin, a young Australian soldier who is suffering from shell shock. Woodward reassigns Tom Dwyer and Norman Morris to relieve Tiffin. Two German tunnelers break through into the tunnel. Morris and Dwyer dispatch both of them, but Dwyer is killed when a German explosive goes off, bringing down the tunnel on top of them; Morris is rescued by the other sappers. Woodward is later tasked with destroying the Red House, a fortified German position raining enfilade fire down upon the frontmost section of the British trenches. Although Woodward initially proposed tunneling beneath the Red House, his commanding officer, Colonel Wilson Rutledge, insisted that it be done by dawn. Along with Corporal Bill Fraser and Morris, Woodward crosses No Man's Land. They manage to reach the Red House and plant explosives underneath it. However, as they make their way back to the British lines, they discover that the reel of cable is too short, so Morris runs ahead to retrieve the exploder. While they wait, they discover mortally wounded Lieutenant Robert Clayton, who had been ordered to cut a gap in the wire obstacle for them. Morris arrives with the exploder and they destroy the Red House.

It means that one of the oldest scientific organisations in the world can hang on to its home in Mayfair, London, for a while yet. The institution, founded in 1799 to link science with wider society, has been in difficulty for several years. In January, the charity said it was considering selling its 21 Albemarle Street home because of its woes. In a statement, the organisation's chairman, Sir Richard Sykes, said: \\"This donation is very timely and will clear the RI's bank debt, as well as giving us the breathing room to explore other options more fully.\\" He stressed though that the organisation's financial situation was far from resolved. Members are also being informed about the latest efforts in developing a new vision for the RI. This is being led by the Future Direction Committee, chaired by the Labour peer Lord Winston and includes Professor Brian Cox and the President of the Royal Society, Professor Sir Paul Nurse . The RI ran into difficulties as a result of the board's decision five years ago to re-fit its 18th Century building, and provide an upmarket restaurant and bar on the site. The £22m project was intended to help attract more people to the institution and promote its work. The plan failed and built up a multi-million-pound debt that led to the RI sacking its then director, Baroness Susan Greenfield. Many notable scientists have worked at the Royal Institution, including Michael Faraday. The organisation provided the setting for much of the research by Mr Faraday that led to the practical exploitation of electricity.

Neil, being an excellent friend and workout partner, knew that it was crucial for Joseph to keep pushing himself in order to achieve his fitness goals and maintain his overall well-being. First, Neil started by reminding Joseph of the progress he had already made and how far he had come in his fitness journey. He pointed out the physical and mental improvements Joseph had experienced since they began working out together, including greater strength, increased stamina, and a newfound sense of self-confidence. By drawing attention to these accomplishments, Neil helped Joseph to recognize the value of persistence and hard work. Neil also provided Joseph with positive encouragement and praise for his efforts in the gym. Compliments and kind words from Neil boosted Joseph's morale and made him feel more capable of completing the challenging exercises. This constructive feedback fueled Joseph's determination, allowing him to dig deep and find the inner strength to continue pushing himself. To further motivate Joseph, Neil proposed setting short-term fitness goals that would be both achievable and rewarding. These goals could be anything from increasing the number of repetitions or sets that Joseph could perform, to trying out new exercises that he had never attempted before. By having tangible objectives in sight, Joseph would be more inclined to stay on track and finish the workouts. Additionally, Neil made an effort to chart Joseph's progress by regularly taking note of the weights he was lifting, his running times, and other personal records. Sharing these achievements, no matter how small, made Joseph feel accomplished and helped him realize that his hard work was indeed paying off. Finally, Neil demonstrated his unwavering support by committing to work out alongside Joseph every step of the way. By being present and participating in the gym sessions, Neil was able to empathize with Joseph's struggles and motivate him in real-time. This camaraderie created a strong bond between the two friends and further solidified Joseph's determination not only to succeed for himself but also to make Neil proud. In conclusion, despite Joseph's fatigue and waning interest in the exercises, Neil's motivational tactics, such as highlighting Joseph's progress, providing positive reinforcement, setting short-term goals, and partnering up for every workout, managed to restore Joseph's enthusiasm and drive. As a result, Joseph was more determined than ever to continue pushing himself and making strides in his fitness journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Refusing a Vatican army of colourful military uniforms from centuries, he got rid of them. He became the first pope to visit five continents. Paul VI systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors, to turn the Euro-centric Church into a Church of the world, by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the Synods which he convened.

The movie, directed by Richard Fleischer and based on the novel by Elmore Leonard, revolves around Vince Majestyk, a Vietnam War veteran who settles into civilian life as a farmer in rural Colorado. His primary crop is watermelons, which play a central role in both the plot and the action sequences throughout the film. Majestyk's life takes a dramatic turn when he becomes entangled with the local mob after a conflict with a small-time criminal named Bobby Kopas. Kopas tries to force Majestyk to hire a group of unskilled farm laborers, but Majestyk insists on using his usual experienced crew to ensure the proper harvest of his watermelon crop. This disagreement escalates into a full-blown battle involving the mob, the police, and a vindictive hitman named Frank Renda. Throughout the movie, watermelons become a recurring theme and symbolize not only Majestyk's livelihood but also his connection to the land and his principles. The climactic action scene, in which Majestyk utilizes his watermelon-filled truck as both a shield and a weapon, underscores the importance of his crop and how interconnected the watermelons are to his life and values. In summary, Charles Bronson's character Vince Majestyk in the 1974 film 'Mr. Majestyk' grows watermelons on his farm, which become a central plot element emphasizing his dedication to hard work, the importance of a honest living, and the challenges he faces as he battles criminals that threaten his way of life.

What is the answer?","completion":"The native British tree commonly known as the Mountain Ash has an alternative name: Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia). This beautiful and resilient tree holds a significant place in British culture, folklore, and history. The Rowan tree is a deciduous species native to the UK and other parts of Europe, as well as North Africa and Western Asia. It grows well at high altitudes and can often be found in the mountains, which is why it is often referred to as the Mountain Ash. However, despite its common name, the Mountain Ash is not a part of the Ash tree family (Fraxinus); it instead belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes fruit trees like apples and pears. The Rowan tree grows up to 15 meters tall and has a relatively thin, greyish-brown trunk. Its leaves are pinnate, meaning they are made up of several leaflets on either side of a central stem, giving them a feather-like appearance. In the spring, clusters of creamy-white flowers bloom, which later give way to vibrant red or orange berries in the autumn. These berries are not only a valuable food source for birds and small mammals, but they can also be used to make flavorful jelly, a popular accompaniment for game dishes in British cuisine. In addition to its aesthetic appeal, the Rowan tree and its bright berries have played a significant role in Celtic mythology, folklore, and traditional medicine. Its berries were believed to offer protection against enchantments and evil spirits, particularly witches. In fact, even today, it is not uncommon to find a Rowan tree planted near houses in rural areas of the UK to ward off bad luck. In traditional medicine, various parts of the Rowan tree were used to treat various ailments. The leaves and bark were believed to help reduce inflammation and alleviate diarrhea, whereas the berries, which are rich in vitamin C, were used to treat colds, flu, and other infections. Moreover, its wood was often used to make sturdy walking sticks, which were considered to be a symbol of good health and safe travels. To sum up, while the Mountain Ash is the common name for this native British tree, its alternative name, Rowan, highlights its intriguing cultural significance and use in traditional medicine. This beautiful and versatile tree not only adds charm to the British landscape but also contributes to its rich historical and cultural tapestry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... Question: Why did narrator had plenty of time? Options: A. not enough information B.

The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What is a threat?\\" Context: \\"Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body. The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices; members who openly disagree with the religion's teachings are expelled and shunned. Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body, reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of \\"God's organization\\". It also warns members to \\"avoid independent thinking\\", claiming such thinking \\"was introduced by Satan the Devil\\" and would \\"cause division\\". Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as \\"apostates\\" who are \\"mentally diseased\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context of the Jehovah's Witnesses' doctrine, the term \\"threat\\" refers to anything that challenges or poses a risk to the beliefs, teachings, and overall unity of the religious group as determined by the Governing Body. A threat in this context can take many forms, such as: 1. Open dissent: Members who openly disagree with the religion's teachings and practices are considered a threat. They can create unrest and conflict within the congregation, potentially leading others to doubt the authority of the Governing Body. 2. Independent thinking: Jehovah's Witnesses believe that \\"independent thinking\\" is a dangerous idea introduced by Satan. They argue that such thinking can undermine the unity of the religious group and cause divisions. Thus, questioning the doctrine and counsel from the Governing Body is considered a threat to the spiritual well-being of the members. 3. Apostates: Those who openly reject official teachings and leave the religion are deemed \\"apostates.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses regard apostates as \\"mentally diseased\\" individuals who chose to separate themselves from God's organization. Such individuals are viewed as threats to the faith and unity of the congregation, as apostates might influence other members to follow suit or question their own beliefs. In summary, a threat in the context of Jehovah's Witnesses and their Governing Body refers to any act, belief, or individual that challenges or endangers the unity, teachings, and authority of the religion. Such threats, according to their doctrine, include open dissent, independent thinking, and apostasy. To maintain their unity and control, the Jehovah's Witnesses condemn and expel those who they consider threats, opting for shunning as a means of preserving the integrity of their congregation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Except for the crackling of flames somewhere below there was not a sound in the two-storey house at Baldwin, Long Island. With his father away on night duty at a local factory, Glenn was worried about the safety of his mother, his sister Karen, 14 and his 12-year-old brother Todd. He ran downstairs through the smoke-filled house to push and pull at Karen and Todd until they sat up. Then he helped each one through the house to the safety of the garden. There, his sister and brother, taking short and quick breaths and coughing, collapsed on the lawn. The nine-year-old raced back into the house and upstairs to his mother's room. He found it impossible to wake her up. Mrs. Kreamer, a victim of the smoke, was unconscious, and there was nobody to help Glenn carry her to the garden. But the boy remained calm and , as a fireman said later, \\"acted with all the self-control of a trained adult.\\" On the bedroom telephone, luckily still working, Glenn called his father and, leaving Mr. Kreamer to telephone the fire brigade and ambulance service, got on with the task of saving his mother. First he filled a bucket with water from the bathroom and threw water over his mother and her bed. Then, with a wet cloth around his head he went back to the garden. He could hear the fire engine coming up, but how would the firemen find his mother in the smoke-filled house where flames had almost swallowed up the ground floor?

Instructions: You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. Input: The film opens with Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and a 12-year-old girl making out on a bed. With no adults around, Telly, who is slightly older, persuades the girl, who is a virgin, to have sex with him. Afterwards, he meets his friend, Casper (Justin Pierce), and they talk about his sexual experience very crudely. Telly has taken to only having sex with virgins. They go inside a local store, where Casper shoplifts a bottle of malt liquor as Telly distracts the cashier. Looking for drugs, food and a place to hang out, they head to their friend Paul's (Sajan Bhagat) apartment, though they express dislike of him on the way there. They arrive at Paul's house, talk about sex and smoke marijuana while watching a skate video (Video Days). Casper inhales nitrous oxide out of balloons, which Telly considers dangerous. The scene intercuts with a group of girls, among them Ruby (Rosario Dawson) and Jennie (Chlo Sevigny), talking about sex each gender contradicting what the other gender says, especially about oral sex. Ruby and Jennie mention that they were recently tested for STDs at Ruby's request, though Jennie only got tested to keep Ruby company. Ruby's test is negative, though she has had multiple sexual encounters, many of them unprotected. Jennie tests positive for HIV. She says she has had sex only once, with Telly. Jennie spends the rest of the film trying to find Telly, to prevent him from unknowingly infecting another girl. Telly and Casper walk to Telly's house and steal money from Telly's mother, who is preoccupied with taking care of her new baby. They go to Washington Square Park and buy a dime bag of marijuana from a Rastafari. They then meet up with a few friends to talk and smoke, one of whom gives a blunt-rolling tutorial. As they do, Casper and many others taunt a homosexual couple passing through the park. On the side, Telly briefly talks to Misha, a girl who strongly dislikes Casper, calling him a jerk. As Casper rides on a skateboard, he carelessly bumps into a man, who furiously threatens him. He pushes Casper, but is struck in the back of the head with a skateboard by Harold (Harold Hunter), a friend of Telly and Casper's, causing him to collapse. A number of other skaters join in, beating, stomping, and hitting the man with their skateboards until he is rendered unconscious by a final blow to the head by Casper; Telly then spits on the man. While discussing whether or not they killed the man at the park, Telly and some of the group from the park pick up a 13-year-old girl named Darcy (Yakira Peguero), the virginal younger sister of an acquaintance, whom Telly wants to have sex with next. He convinces her to go with them to a pool. The other girls engage in pseudo-lesbian kissing and flirtation, but Darcy is restrained, though not shocked by the others' behavior. Telly and the group go to an unsupervised party at the house of another friend, Steven (Jon Abrahams). Meanwhile, Jennie makes her way to Washington Square Park. Here, she talks to Misha, who tells her about Telly's possible whereabouts. Jennie goes to a rave club called NASA trying to find Telly. She runs into a raver boy, Fidget (Harmony Korine credit as Avi, his brother), who shoves a pill in her mouth, which he refers to as \\"a euphoric blockbuster drug that's supposed to make special K look weak\\". It turns out to be a depressant (similar to Valium or Xanax). The pill kicks in and Jennie eventually finds out that Telly is at the party at Steven's house. Jennie arrives at the party only to learn she is too late, as she discovers Telly having sex with Darcy, thus exposing her to HIV. Emotionally drained and the drug still affecting her, Jennie cries and passes out on a couch among the other sleeping partygoers. A drunken Casper proceeds to rape Jennie unprotected as she sleeps, unknowingly exposing himself to HIV as well. The film ends with a poignant look at several early-morning junkies on the streets of New York City, as well as a soliloquy by Telly about how without sex he would have nothing to live for. The final shot features Casper drinking liquor first thing in the morning and looking at the camera and saying \\"Jesus Christ, what happened?\\" Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identifying specific characters and their actions. Usage: Who does Telly convince to have sex with him in the beginning of the film? He persuades a 12-year-old girl. The instruction mentions specifying character names, and Telly is the character who persuades the girl, which meets the criteria. Part #2: Referencing specific events. Usage: What item does Casper steal from the local store while Telly distracts the cashier? Casper steals a bottle of malt liquor. This question focuses on a key event in the story, where Telly and Casper go to a local store, and Casper shoplifts while Telly distracts the cashier. Part #3: Mentioning facts and beliefs. Usage: What does Telly consider dangerous when Casper is inhaling nitrous oxide out of balloons? He considers it dangerous. This question asks about Telly's belief, which is a key part of the story, showing that the criteria are met. Part #4: Avoiding actor names. Usage: How does Telly's friend Harold react when Casper is pushed by a man after bumping into him on a skateboard? Harold hits the man in the back of the head with a skateboard. This response avoids using the actor's name (Harold Hunter) and instead, focuses on the character's name and actions. Part #5: Asking a question about different parts of the plot. Usage: After discovering that she is HIV positive, what is Jennie's main goal throughout the rest of the film?

He poured a cup of coffee and sat down across from me. \\"Big shakeup last night,\\" he said. \\"I just got a call to defend one of the Preacher's errand boys.\\" \\"So they finally got to him,\\" I said, remembering the furor that had raged in the newspapers a few months before. The law had never been able to break up the Preacher's drug operation, even though it was notorious as the biggest in Texas. \\"How'd they do it?\\" \\"It's very hush-hush,\\" he said, steam from his coffee making his hair seem to ripple. \\"They squelched the story at the papers, hoping to pull in a couple more fish, I guess.

Rudolf Nureyev was born on a Trans-Siberian train near Irkutsk, Siberia, Soviet Union, while his mother, Feride, was travelling to Vladivostok, where his father Hamit, a Red Army political commissar, was stationed. He was raised as the only son with three older sisters in a Tatar Muslim family. When his mother took Rudolf Nureyev and his sisters into a performance of the ballet Song of the Cranes, he fell in love with dance. As a child he was encouraged to dance in Bashkir folk performances and his precocity was soon noticed by teachers who encouraged him to train in Saint Petersburg. When AIDS appeared in France's news around 1982, Nureyev took little notice. The dancer tested positive for HIV in 1984, but for several years he simply denied that anything was wrong with his health. However, by the late 1980s his diminished capabilities disappointed his admirers who had fond memories of his outstanding prowess and skill. Nureyev began a marked decline only in the summer of 1991 and entered the final phase of the disease in the spring of 1992. In March 1992, living with advanced AIDS, he visited Kazan and appeared as a conductor in front of the audience at Musa Calil Tatar Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, which now presents the Rudolf Nureyev Festival in Tatarstan. Returning to Paris, with a high fever, he was admitted to the hospital Notre Dame du Perpetuel Secours in Levallois-Perret, a suburb northwest of Paris, and was operated on for pericarditis, an inflammation of the membranous sac around the heart. At that time, what inspired him to fight his illness was the hope that he could fulfill an invitation to conduct Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet at an American Ballet Theatre benefit on 6 May 1992 at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. He did so and was elated at the reception. In July 1992, Nureyev showed renewed signs of pericarditis but determined to forswear further treatment. His last public appearance was on 8 October 1992, at the premiere at Palais Garnier of a new production of La Bayadere that he choreographed after Marius Petipa for the Paris Opera Ballet. Nureyev had managed to obtain a photocopy of the original score by Minkus when in Russia in 1989. The ballet was a personal triumph although the gravity of his condition was evident. The French Culture Minister, Jack Lang, presented him that evening on stage with France's highest cultural award, the Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together, perhaps. It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there.

The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania.

Investing in a new pedicure seemed smart for Felicia but not Emily because","completion":"Felicia was someone who always loved to pamper herself and stay up-to-date with the latest fashion and beauty trends. She was an ardent believer in self-care, and a pedicure was a must-have on her list. It had been a particularly taxing and strenuous month for Felicia at work, and she decided that she deserved to treat herself for all the hard work and determination she had shown. A luxury pedicure at a high-end salon was just what she needed to soothe her aching feet, while also giving her nails a glossy makeover that she could flaunt in her fabulous collection of shoes. Felicia had heard about a renowned salon offering a premium pedicure service that utilized the newest techniques in exfoliation, hydration, and massage therapy. The state-of-the-art establishment boasted cutting-edge technology and sumptuous, relaxing lounges, with skilled nail technicians who catered their services according to each client's individual needs. Moreover, the salon used only the finest vegan and cruelty-free nail products that offered a wide range of vibrant colors and finishes. For these reasons, Felicia decided that investing in a new pedicure at the salon was more than a smart choice. It was an opportunity to experience an unmatched level of comfort and indulgence while maintaining her style and fashion standards. The benefits extended beyond her personal appearance; an hour at the salon would provide much-needed relaxation, boosting her morale and rejuvenating her spirits. The combination of these mental and physical advantages made the decision to invest in the new pedicure an easy one for Felicia. Emily, on the other hand, had a completely different perspective on self-care and pedicures. Thrifty and practical, she believed in a more minimalist approach to beauty routines. In her view, pedicures were a luxury that one could do without. Instead of splurging on expensive salon treatments, Emily felt that her budget could be better utilized on more meaningful experiences, such as cooking classes, weekend trips, or investments in her education and career. Additionally, Emily was no stranger to the idea of rolling up her sleeves and getting her hands dirty. She actually took pride in her ability to tackle DIY projects, and this extended to her personal grooming. Instead of relying on a professional, Emily had acquired her own pedicure kit that she used to maintain her nails. She derived satisfaction from the time and effort she dedicated to it, making it an essential part of her cherished self-care routine. So, while investing in a new pedicure seemed like a smart idea to Felicia, Emily had other priorities and believed that her money could be allocated differently. Although both women had their reasons, this story truly highlights the importance of individual preferences and priorities when it comes to self-care. Ultimately, the most valuable lesson to take away is that everyone has unique needs and differing opinions on what makes them feel their best."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It behaves according to Hooke's Law, which states that the force required to compress or extend a spring is directly proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position. In simpler terms, the more you compress a spring, the greater the force it exerts to return to its original shape. In the case of an ideal spring, as long as the elastic limit of the spring has not been exceeded, it will return to its original shape once the external force is removed. The elastic limit is the maximum amount of stress that a material can experience without undergoing permanent deformation. When Andy compresses the spring, it will store potential energy and will want to return to its original shape as soon as the force is taken away. If the spring is not damaged or deformed beyond its elastic limit during the compression, it will return to its original shape once the compression force is released."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A report shows that these are not the only important inventions. Here are four other important ones. Paper is one of the most important inventions. You can't have printing without paper. In 105 AD, Cai Lun invented paper in China. Long before the printing and Internet, Cai Lun's invention allowed us to write down information, stories and history. One of the simplest inventions to save life is the toilet. Before toilets, waste ran into the rivers from people's houses. Illnesses were common in big cities, and it was often difficult to find clean drinking water. Animal food is another invention. Before the invention, most animals were killed every autumn because there was not enough food for them in the winter. After hay became a kind of common animal food, animals could live through the long winter. Reading glasses is the fourth invention. People start getting far-sighted from the age of 45.

Next question: what is the age of a minor in uk?","completion":"In the United Kingdom, the age of a minor, often referred to as the age of minority, varies depending on the specific context and legislative framework in question. Generally speaking, a minor is considered to be an individual under 18 years of age. However, different ages come with different legal rights and responsibilities. For clarity, we will go through some of these different age limits and their implications. 1. Age of criminal responsibility: In the UK, the age of criminal responsibility is set at 10 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and 12 in Scotland. This implies that a child below these ages cannot be held legally responsible for any criminal act they commit. However, they can enter the youth justice system through alternative measures such as rehabilitation or welfare support. 2. Age of consent: The age of consent for sexual activity is 16 across the entire UK, including England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This means that young people at the age of 16 or above are legally allowed to engage in consensual sexual activities, while those below this age are not. 3. Age to leave education: The minimum school leaving age in the UK is 16. However, individuals are required to stay in some form of education or training until they reach the age of 18. This could include staying in full-time education, pursuing an apprenticeship, or working or volunteering for 20 hours or more per week while engaging in part-time accredited education or training. 4. Age to work: Full-time work is generally permitted for young individuals who have attained the minimum school leaving age of 16. However, there are restrictions on the types of jobs they can hold, the hours they can work, and the minimum wage they should receive. Individuals under 13 are not allowed to work, and those aged 13 to 16 can only engage in light work. 5. Age to vote: In the UK, the minimum voting age for general elections and referendums is 18. This includes England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. However, Scotland has a lower voting age of 16 for its local elections and elections for the Scottish Parliament. 6. Age to smoke and purchase tobacco products: The legal age for purchasing tobacco products and e-cigarettes is 18 in the UK. It is also illegal for an adult to buy tobacco or e-cigarettes on behalf of anyone under the age of 18. 7. Age to drink alcohol: The legal age to purchase and consume alcohol is 18 in the UK. However, young individuals aged 16 or 17 can consume beer, wine, or cider when having a meal at a licensed premises accompanied by an adult. 8. Age to drive: In the UK, the minimum age to drive a car or motorcycle is 17. For mopeds, the minimum age is 16. In summary, the age of a minor in the UK is generally considered to be anyone under the age of 18. However, various rights and responsibilities come into effect at specific ages, determining the legal status of young individuals in different circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Business Insider reports that things aren't exactly hunky-dory at Whole Foods in the wake of Amazon's acquisition of it, and the 27 current and newly former employees it spoke with say the OTS system is a big part of the reason why. That's \\"order-to-shelf.\\" The Austin Business Journal explains it's an inventory-management system that, as the name suggests, tries to move products from the truck right to the shelf, ideally increasing efficiency while trimming waste. But the employees say it's leading to food shortages, anxiety, crushed morale, and tears. \\"Seeing someone cry at work is becoming normal,\\" says a West Coast employee. One of the more damning quotes from a Georgia employee: \\"We've lost team leaders, store team leaders ... and even a regional vice president.

With this launch in late 2010 and early 2011, Microsoft completely rebuilt its mobile operating system from the ground up by adding a more intuitive interface, better social-networking tools and a high-def screen with colorful \\"live tiles.\\" It was a radical move for a company that for years had been playing it safe. Misses. Internet Explorer 6 -- This version of Microsoft's widely used desktop browser was roundly criticized for its security flaws and lack of support for modern Web standards. Zune -- In 2006, Microsoft finally launched its answer to Apple's hot-selling iPod. But the clunky Zune line of portable media players never caught on, and by late 2009 their market share had dropped to 2%. It didn't help that at midnight on December 31, 2008, all of Zune's 30GB models froze up for a day -- a problem with the way the device's internal clock recognized (or didn't recognize) leap years. Microsoft put the Zune out of its misery in 2011. Vista -- Released in 2007, this successor to Windows XP was an immediate dud. Critics complained about its cost, sluggish speed, restrictive licensing terms and how Vista aimed to discourage the copying of protected digital media. One survey of corporate users found only 8% said they were \\"very satisfied\\" with the operating system. Stung by the reaction, Microsoft rushed out Windows 7 less than three years later. Surface tablets -- Again, Microsoft found itself chasing Apple, this time with a belated attempt to dethrone the market-leading iPad. Launched in October 2012 -- more than two years after the original iPad -- the Surface tablet was Microsoft's first attempt to integrate its new Windows 8 operating system with its own hardware. Despite some good reviews, the Surface hasn't clicked with consumers. Microsoft earned only 853 million from the Surface between its launch last fall and the close of the company's fiscal year -- a small fraction of iPad sales revenue during that time.

Write a summary based on this article: Anna Kooiman reported this morning on new concerns over electronic cigarettes after kids were poisoned by drinking the liquid nicotine that comes with the devices. Teens have reportedly been drinking the nicotine on purpose in some instances, mixing it with energy drinks to get a quick high. VIRAL: Nun Stuns 'The Voice' Judges With Alicia Keys Song The vials containing the nicotine are often colorfully packaged and come in flavors like cotton candy or bubble gum. Whether the cases are in young children or teens, ER doctors are seeing more and more of these poisonings taking place. \\"Nicotine is a very potent drug. It gets into your blood stream. It could increase your heart rate, it could give you changes in your blood pressure, it can even cause death,\\" said Dr. Manny Alvarez. Just one teaspoon of the liquid nicotine is the equivalent of three packs of cigarettes. In addition, dogs are also at risk if they get a hold of one of the devices and chew on it. Lawmakers across the country are now looking at new regulations that would require child-proof caps on the vials. Watch the report above. Check out some of the most OUTRAGEOUS from Fox News: Breast Cancer Survivor Told to Take Down Pink Ribbon Shocking Video Shows Girl & Seemingly Impaired Mom on PA Bus Six Flags Turns Wounded Vet Away From Ride, Denies Him Refund ||||| Reports of children consuming poisonous liquid from e-cigarettes rose sharply in Minnesota last year, prompting health officials to warn that the state may be facing a new public health hazard. Only one child was hospitalized as a result of consuming the nicotine-laced liquid, but the total number of cases — 50 — was a tenfold increase over 2012, the Minnesota Department of Health said Tuesday. “We really want parents to know that this liquid nicotine can pose a fatal risk and that they should store it out of the reach of children,” said Dr. Ed Ehlinger, state health commissioner. The increase tracks the growing popularity of e-cigarettes, battery-powered cartridges that heat up flavored liquid and produce an inhaled nicotine vapor. Many e-cigarette users, or “vapers,’’ use them as a lower-nicotine alternative to cigarettes, or as a bridge to quitting cigarettes altogether. One in five smokers had tried e-cigarettes in 2011, twice as many as a year earlier, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the 50 cases reported by Minnesota Poison Control, 14 resulted in trips to hospital emergency rooms and one required treatment in intensive care. The cases involved children and teens up to age 19, but the majority — 36 — involved children age 3 or younger. “We think of concentrated nicotine as a very serious poison, equivalent to dangerous prescription drugs,” said Stacey Bangh, clinical supervisor of the poison center, which is located at Hennepin County Medical Center. The report on poisoning cases also comes amid a legislative debate over whether to expand the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act to apply to e-cigarettes, meaning they couldn’t be used in workplaces, bars and other public indoor spaces. Such a change, however, would not do anything to protect children from the small vials that contain e-cigarette liquid. Matt Black, president of the Minnesota Vapers advocacy group, said that risk would be better addressed by a requirement that all such vials be sold with childproof caps. “I take the same precautions with my liquids as I did with my cigarettes,” said Black, whose daughter is 13. “[Keep] them up on high shelves if you have small kids, or hidden if you have older kids.” Most e-cigarette vials already have safety caps, but they are not required by state or federal law. Ehlinger said he would support efforts to increase child-resistant packaging. Jesse Ly of Anoka has taken the precaution of locking his e-cigarette materials in a toolbox to keep them away from his 6-month-old boy. “My kid likes pirates,” said Ly, 20, who works in an e-cigarette shop. “Pirates are known for finding ‘hidden treasure.’ I don’t want him to just stumble upon anything like that — be it alcohol, e-liquid, or anything like that.” One concern is the packaging of e-cig liquid vials, which often have pictures of chocolate or various fruits to reflect their flavors. “I suppose seeing a big old jug of Clorox is different, as opposed to a bottle with a strawberry or a piece of chocolate on it,” said Ben Wilkins, an e-cigarette user from Jordan, whose fiancée has children who are 10 and 8 years old. Wilkins keeps his vaping materials out of sight and tells the boys that the e-cigarette vials are just like the pill bottles in the medicine cabinet with the “bad icky face” on them. Children’s Hospital in St. Paul has seen a handful of children in the emergency room suspected of ingesting e-cigarette liquid, according to Dr. Rob Sicoli, the ER’s co-director. But Children’s still sees more cases of “the toddler that eats a cigarette butt or two,” Sicoli said. Emergency personnel commonly use liquid charcoal to soak up nicotine in the stomach of a toddler who swallows cigarettes, Sicoli said, but it might not be as effective for children swallowing e-cigarette juice because the stomach absorbs liquid much more quickly. ||||| Summary:","completion":"There has been a growing concern over electronic cigarettes after reports indicate that children have been poisoned by accidentally drinking the liquid nicotine that comes with the devices. In some instances, teenagers have also purposely consumed the liquid, mixing it with energy drinks to obtain a quick high. The nicotine vials are often colorfully packaged and come in various flavors, making them appealing to children and teenagers. The number of poisonings due to the consumption of liquid nicotine has been increasing, posing significant health risks, as it can cause rapid increases in heart rate, blood pressure changes, and even death. Just one teaspoon of liquid nicotine is equivalent to three packs of cigarettes. Lawmakers are now looking into implementing new regulations that would require child-proof caps on the vials to prevent such incidents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Installed couldn't update did nothing\\" A:","completion":"Based on the given review, I would rate it a 2 out of 5. Here is a detailed breakdown of the rating: 1. Clarity: The review is not very clear or informative. It does not provide enough context or specific information about the issue faced, such as details about the product, software, or service being reviewed. The reviewer states that the item \\"didn't work at all,\\" which could be more accurately explained. 2. Constructive Feedback: The review does not offer constructive feedback that could be useful for the developers or potential customers. It merely states that the product didn't work and that they were unable to update it. For a more meaningful review, it would be helpful if the reviewer elaborated on their specific problem, potential solutions they attempted, or areas where they believe the item can be improved. 3. Details: There is a lack of details concerning the relevant aspects of the reviewer's experience. The review omits important elements such as the type of product, its brand, the version they were using, or any other specifications. These details would make the review more relevant and useful for potential customers. 4. Objectivity: Since the reviewer does not provide any context or specific issues they encountered, it is hard to assess the objectivity of the review. To better support their claims, they should back them up with particular examples of the problems they had. 5. Emotion: The rating has been affected by the lack of emotion in the review. Although emotion is not always necessary for a review, it can provide insight into the user experience and the level of frustration or satisfaction the reviewer had. The brief statement that the product \\"did nothing\\" does not give a clear indication of the emotions or experiences the reviewer went through. Overall, this review has been given a rating of 2 out of 5 due to its lack of clarity, absence of constructive feedback, inadequate details, questionable objectivity, and minimal emotion. To improve the quality and usefulness of the review, the reviewer could provide more specific information, offer some suggestions for improvement, and share their emotional experience while using the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform. Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan, an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor, a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in insider trading. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails. While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable. Despite having a nagging feeling that something is wrong, the numbers check out and Naomi continues to try to sell the shares of the company to investors. Michael, who has had no new insider trading tips to pass on to his friends at investment firm Titanite, tries unsuccessfully to hack into Naomi's phone.

This absorption of Latin and Greek texts started before the Renaissance of the 12th century, as contact with Arabs during the Crusades provided access to Latin translations.

Options: *negative *positive","completion":"The sentiment of the given tweet can best be described as negative. Analyzing the content of the tweet, the user is expressing frustration or dissatisfaction with the situation described. The use of words such as \\"SCREAM\\" indicates strong emotions, and in the given context, it is probably negative. The latter part of the tweet where the user expresses that 'Ken Kamata needs the love', also implies a form of dissatisfaction with another character in the scenario, enhancing the overall negative sentiment. While the definition of a tweet's sentiment can be subjective, and sometimes depends on the specific knowledge of the characters or situations involved, therein lies the essence of sentiment analysis. Typically, the task of determining sentiment refers to categorizing the emotional tone behind a series of words - whether it's a sentence, tweet or a document, into a specific category such as positive, negative, or neutral. In this scenario, based on the expression of strong, seemingly negative emotions (\\"SCREAM\\") and the exasperation indicated by \\"Sheesh\\", the sentiment analysis leans more toward the negative side.

Even reading about yawning can make you do it. Now, a new study has found why yawning has such a powerful force. Yawning when others yawn, the study suggests, is a sign of pity and a form of social connection. Kids don't develop this deeply rooted behavior until around age four, the study found. Kids with autism are less likely to catch yawns. In the most serious cases, they never do. Yawning might help doctors to see whether the children are developing rightly. The work could also lead to a better understanding of the ways that people communicate and connect. \\"Emotional infection seems to be a born thing that connects us together,\\" said Molly Helt, a graduate student in psychology at the University of Connecticut. \\"Yawning may be part of that.\\" Inspiration for her study came when she tried to get her own autistic son to clear his ears on an airplane.

Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"Floristry is the art of creating arrangements with flowers and plant materials. Among the key elements in achieving stunning and memorable floral designs is the understanding and application of color harmony through the use of great contrasts. Striking color schemes are essential in captivating the eye and evoking emotions. Color harmony refers to the aesthetically pleasing combination of colors. In floral design, colors work together through different techniques to create a cohesive and eye-catching arrangement. The choices of flowers, foliage, and other accessories should be based on a thorough understanding of color theory. HSV (Hue, Saturation, and Value) and RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) are color models that can help you understand and manipulate colors. They are crucial when considering contrasts in floral design. Here are some techniques for creating color harmony of great contrasts in floristry: 1. Complementary colors: These are colors that oppose each other on the color wheel. Pairing them together generates a stark contrast, making each hue appear more vivid. Examples of complementary color pairs include red and green, blue and orange, or yellow and purple. Be mindful of the tone and intensity of these colors to create a balanced arrangement. 2. Triadic colors: This approach involves using three colors that are evenly spaced on the color wheel. Opting for a triadic color scheme will yield a vibrant and harmonious arrangement. For instance, place red flowers as the focal point and complement them with blue and yellow flowers, or contrast purple flowers with orange and green elements. 3. Analogous colors: These refer to colors situated close to each other on the color wheel. To create great contrast while maintaining some visual consistency, choose a color on the wheel and use its neighbors. For example, choose shades of red with neighboring orange and purple hues, or combine shades of green with yellow and blue accents. The key here is to vary the intensity and tone of the colors while ensuring a coherent overall color scheme. 4. Monochromatic: Focus on one hue and play with its various shades, tones, and tints. This can create a highly sophisticated and visually pleasing floral arrangement. Combine light and dark variations of a single color to create depth. For instance, use a light pastel pink with a rich magenta to make the arrangement pop. 5. Accents and fillers: Enhance the contrast and harmony of your arrangement by using small amounts of a contrasting color or texture. This could come in the form of flowers, foliage, or even accessories like ribbons and vases. For example, add vibrant green foliage to a purple and yellow arrangement, lift a monochromatic blue bouquet with bright white flowers, or incorporate dark burgundy foliage to a pink and peach flower combination. In conclusion, the exploration of color harmony and the use of great contrasts will take your floristry skills to new heights. Utilizing complementary, triadic, analogous, monochromatic, and accent techniques can result in visually stunning and emotionally evocative floral arrangements. Make sure to take into consideration the occasion, the preferences of the recipient, and the environment when creating your designs. Most importantly, let your creativity shine and have fun experimenting with colors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let me explain each one to you! 1. How do electrons, protons, and neutrons determine the characteristics of an element? Imagine an atom is like a tiny solar system. The protons and neutrons live in the center, called the nucleus, and the electrons move around it. The number of protons in the nucleus gives an element its identity. For example, if an atom has 1 proton, it is hydrogen, and if it has 2 protons, it is helium. Electrons, which move around the nucleus, also play a role in an element's characteristics because they are involved in how elements react with each other. 2. What does the number of neutrons in an atom determine? Neutrons live in the nucleus with protons, but they don't give an atom its identity like protons do. Instead, they help hold the nucleus together. The number of neutrons can vary for the same element. These different versions are called isotopes. Some isotopes are more stable than others and can even be radioactive, which means they break down over time.

Purchase fresh when it fits your budget and timing. Fresh fruits and vegetables can be more expensive, but are worth the money in nutrition and flavor. Usually they can be eaten raw or cooked. Sometimes there is not a substitute for fresh. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be consumed in the week you purchase them to avoid rot or lessening nutritional value. Antioxidant content begins to degrade immediately after harvest as do some vitamins, so the closer to harvest you eat them the more nutrition you will obtain. Frozen vegetables are frozen quickly after harvest and maintain many nutrients. They are easy to cook and can be stored for long periods of time. They are also very affordable and readily available. Frozen fruit is also a good option. It can be defrosted overnight and eaten without cooking, but the texture will have changed because of the freezing process. It is best to use frozen fruit for desserts or to cook with. Canned vegetables are great for making soups and casseroles. They are also convenient. Canned vegetables may have lost some nutrients during the high heat cooking process, but they still contain a fair amount. Having canned fruits and vegetables on hand helps with having a fruit or vegetable at every meal. When purchasing canned fruit be sure to read the label. Many canned fruits are packed in syrup, which adds extra sugar and calories. Try purchasing canned fruit in juice or water instead. Canned fruit is great for all ages because it is typically softer and comes pre-portioned. ” Purees are useful for making smoothies and adding sauces. Juice has nutrients, but lacks the fiber. It is good for getting a fruit in when you don’t have time or you are not somewhere fruit is readily available. The high sugar and calorie content of juice makes it a tricky choice. The best way to consume is in moderation. Also, remember to only purchase 100% fruit juice. Summary:","completion":"The decision of purchasing fresh, frozen, or canned fruits and vegetables depends on your budget, timing, and nutritional needs. Fresh fruits and vegetables offer the best nutrition and flavor but tend to be more expensive. These should ideally be consumed within the week of purchase to maximize their nutritional value. Alternatively, frozen fruits and vegetables are a cost-effective choice which retains many nutrients due to fast freezing post-harvest. These provide easy meal options due to their long shelf-life. Canned vegetables, while losing some nutrients during the high-heat processing, are also a good option adding convenience to meal preparation. However, caution should be exercised while buying canned fruits as they are sometimes packed in syrup, which can add unnecessary sugar and calories to your diet. Purees and juices offer an alternative way to include fruits in the diet, especially when fresh fruits are not readily available, but should be consumed in moderation due to their high sugar content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

A tape of his confession was played in court in Stephenville, Texas on Monday as Routh's murder trial entered its second week. The former Marine, 27, is accused of shooting dead Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield after they took him to a gun range in February 2013 as he battled PTSD. In the taped confession, which was taken just hours after he was arrested, Routh told Texas Ranger Danny Briley that he killed the men because he thought they were 'headhunters' who were 'trying to hunt everybody down'. He shot dead Kyle first - because he recognized him more - before shooting dead","completion":"Littlefield, who he claimed he did not know as well. During the confession, Routh rambled about his beliefs on the killings and his reasons for committing the crime. In this answer, we will delve deep into the reasons, psychology, and progression of the case. First and foremost, it is essential to understand Routh's background and the events leading up to the tragic incident. Eddie Ray Routh was a former Marine with a history of mental illness, most notably post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and paranoid schizophrenia. Routh served in Iraq and Haiti, which exposed him to traumatic situations and significantly impacted his mental health. The crux of Routh's trial hinged on whether he was legally insane at the time of the killings. His defense claimed that Routh was suffering from severe mental illness, leading him to believe that Kyle and Littlefield posed an imminent threat to his life. This assertion was based on his rambling confession, as well as other behaviors, such as his belief that pigs were trying to communicate with him shortly before the incident. During the trial, mental health experts testified that Routh showed symptoms of schizophrenia, which could lead to delusions and paranoid thoughts. This explanation would align with his claim that he had believed Kyle and Littlefield to be \\"headhunters\\" trying to take his soul. However, prosecution experts countered that Routh could have been experiencing drug-induced psychosis, brought about by his heavy marijuana use. In the confession played in court, Routh told investigators that he recognized Chris Kyle and proceeded to shoot him first because he was more familiar with him. He then shot Chad Littlefield, who he did not know as well, driven by his paranoid belief that they were coming for him. Routh later mentioned that both men had not tried to engage with him at the gun range, which further fueled his sense of paranoia. While Kyle and Littlefield's intentions were to be supportive, in Routh's mind, a skewed reality led him to believe he was in danger. The tragedy underscores the importance of understanding and addressing the complexities of mental health, especially in those who have experienced trauma in their lives. The trial ultimately concluded with a jury in Texas finding Eddie Ray Routh guilty of capital murder in the deaths of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The verdict indicates that the jury did not accept the argument that Routh was legally insane at the time of the killings. Instead, they believed beyond a reasonable doubt that he was aware of his actions and could distinguish right from wrong, regardless of his mental state. The factors that contributed to the tragic incident include Routh's history of mental health issues, exposure to traumatic experiences, and the lack of timely and effective support to address his mental health needs. The case underscores the need for increased awareness surrounding mental health, particularly among veterans and active military personnel, and the significance of providing appropriate care and resources to help individuals manage their psychological struggles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this case, the woman's rhetorical question seeks to emphasize her agreement with the man's statement. By suggesting that they indeed have not experienced so much snow before, the woman is reinforcing the man's observation. It is worth noting that her response does not imply any disagreement or indication that they are late.

Write a summary based on this article: Cigarette Taxes Deter Heavy Drinking, Study Says Smoking increases risk for problematic drinking, researcher notes WebMD News from HealthDay WebMD News Archive By Robert Preidt HealthDay Reporter FRIDAY, Aug. 9 (HealthDay News) -- Higher cigarette taxes help reduce drinking among certain groups of people, U.S. researchers say. To assess the impact that increases in cigarette taxes between 2001-02 and 2004-05 had on drinking behavior, researchers analyzed data from more than 21,000 drinkers who took part in a survey from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The cigarette tax increases were associated with modest to moderate reductions in drinking among \\"vulnerable groups,\\" according to the study, which was published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research. \\"Results suggest that increases in cigarette taxes were associated with reductions in alcohol consumption over time among male smokers,\\" corresponding author Sherry McKee, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine, said in a journal news release. \\"The protective effects were most pronounced among subgroups who are most at risk for adverse alcohol-related consequences, including male heavy drinkers, young adults and those with the lowest income.\\" Smoking and heavy drinking occur together at very high rates, McKee said, noting that tobacco can enhance the subjective effects of alcohol and has been shown to increase the risk for heavy and problematic drinking. Cigarette taxes, meanwhile, have been recognized as one of the most significant policy instruments to reduce smoking, McKee said. \\"By increasing the price of cigarettes, taxes are thought to encourage smokers to reduce their use of cigarettes or quit altogether, and discourage non-smokers from starting to smoke,\\" she said. Christopher Kahler, professor and chairman of the department of behavioral and social sciences at Brown School of Public Health, welcomed the new study. \\"These findings suggest that if states increase taxes on cigarettes, they are not only likely to reduce smoking -- based on a large body of literature -- but they also may have a modest impact on heavy drinking rates among men, those with lower income and those who drink most heavily,\\" he said in the news release. \\"In other words, policies that target one specific health behavior may have broader benefits to public health by affecting additional health behaviors that tend to co-occur with the targeted health behavior,\\" he said. ||||| Cigarettes and booze go together like chips and dip? A new study suggests higher cigarette taxes can reduce heavy drinking among male and young adult smokers. Pascal Le Segretain Tax hikes on cigarettes have proven to drop tobacco consumption. No shock there; if something costs more, people tend to limit purchases. But research released Friday suggests that higher cigarette taxes are also associated with reduced alcohol consumption, at least among male and young adult smokers. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 46 million Americans both smoke and drink. And past research has shown that “smokers drink more,” Ali Yurasek, a psychology doctoral candidate at the University of Memphis who’s studied the link, told NBC News. The new study -- conducted by researchers from Yale, Stanford and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, and published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research -- compared almost 11,000 people in 31 states that increased cigarette taxes between the 2001-2002 period and the 2004-2005 period, with a similar number of people from 15 states in which taxes remained the same. Using reported alcohol consumption between the two time periods as captured by the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, the researchers were able to track any differences. “What our analysis shows is an association between increasing cigarette tax and decreasing [alcohol consumption] among segments of the population, those being male smokers, male hazardous drinkers, and young adult smokers in particular,” Sherry A. McKee, associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University Medical School, and one of the study’s authors, said in an interview. Male smokers drank approximately 10 percent less alcohol per session, and binged approximately seven fewer times per year in states with tobacco tax hikes, compared with male smokers who were not hit with the higher taxes. Young adult smokers 18-29 in states that raised cigarette taxes cut episodes of binge drinking per year by nearly one-quarter. Again, the effect was mainly among males. “That’s pretty consistent with behavioral economics concepts,” said Yurasek, who recently published work showing smokers are willing to pay more for alcohol than non-smokers. That’s because cigarettes and booze go together like chips and dip. They are what economists call “complements,” like hamburger and buns or coffee and sugar. Often, when the price of one complementary good rises, consumption of the other falls. McKee stressed that this epidemiological study does not prove cause-and-effect because it can’t control for a number of other possible factors such as people moving from one state to another between time periods, and the fact that the survey relies on self-reports of alcohol use. Still, the apparent effect makes sense, as does the difference between men and women in the study. First, using alcohol and nicotine together has “additive” effects on the brain, McKee said. Lab studies with animals have shown that exposing a key part of the brain involved in reward and motivation to nicotine increases the response of dopamine-emitting neurons to alcohol. In other words, nicotine can make booze seem more rewarding. Lab animals given nicotine will drink more booze. Second, while the full explanation for the male-female difference isn't yet fully understood, alcohol and nicotine have slightly different effects on men and women. For example, men typically produce more brain dopamine in response to booze than women do. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which used data from 2004 and 2005, males are about twice as likely to report binge drinking and heavy alcohol use as females. Alcohol and tobacco are additive in another way: using both increases the risk of some serious cancers, like head and neck and oral cancers. When asked what her results might say about the current “e-cigarette,” craze, McKee said that while the devices haven’t been studied specifically for interactions with alcohol, studies have shown “that when nicotine has been administered in other forms aside from cigarettes, or tobacco, we do see increases in drinking behavior.” Brian Alexander is a frequent contributor to NBC News and a co-author of “The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex, and the Science of Attraction.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"A study found that higher cigarette taxes can help reduce heavy drinking among certain groups of people.

Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon.

Answer the following question. \\"Whose works include \\"\\"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\\"\\" (1912) and a parody of the \\"\\"Mona Lisa\\"\\" (1919) which shows a moustache and goatee attached to a cheap reproduction of the painting?\\"","completion":"The artist whose works include \\"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\\" (1912) and a parody of the \\"Mona Lisa\\" (1919) featuring a mustache and goatee attached to a cheap reproduction of the painting is Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp was a French-American artist who had a significant and lasting impact on modern art, conceptual art, and the Dada movement. Born on July 28, 1887, in Blainville, France, Marcel Duchamp came from a family with a strong artistic background. He was one of six siblings, all of whom were either artists or musicians. Duchamp's early career saw him exploring various forms of artistic expression, such as painting, drawing, and printmaking. His early works were primarily influenced by post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism. \\"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\\" (1912) is one of Marcel Duchamp's most famous works, in which he combined elements of both Cubism and Futurism. The painting depicts a figure in motion as it descends a staircase, showcasing a non-traditional approach to the representation of movement by breaking the subject down into a series of abstract, geometric shapes. It generated a significant amount of controversy and attention when it was first displayed at the Armory Show in New York City back in 1913, and it remains an essential work in the history of modern art. The 1919 parody of Leonardo da Vinci's \\"Mona Lisa\\" is another well-known work by Duchamp. Officially titled \\"L.H.O.O.Q.,\\" the piece involves a postcard-sized reproduction of the iconic portrait with a mustache and goatee drawn in pencil. The name itself is a French pun that, when pronounced, sounds like \\"Elle a chaud au cul,\\" roughly translating to \\"She has a hot ass\\" in English. This irreverent modification of a revered masterpiece exemplifies Duchamp's Dadaist approach, which was characterized by its disdain for conventional artistic practices and conventional tastes. Marcel Duchamp's artistic philosophy revolved around the belief that the idea or intellectual concept behind the artwork was more important than its formal or aesthetic qualities. This notion would eventually lead to his invention of \\"Readymades,\\" a series of found objects that Duchamp transformed into art by modifying them in some way or simply assigning them a new meaning as an artistic expression. This radical approach to art-making not only disrupted the traditional norms but also paved the way for future artists to experiment and expand the boundaries of artistic practices. Throughout his career, Duchamp remained an influential and enigmatic figure, often challenging conventional ideas about art and serving as an inspiration for many artists who followed him. His pioneering works and unique philosophy have substantially shaped modern and contemporary art as we know it today. Marcel Duchamp passed away on October 2, 1968, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, but his ideas and influence continue to resonate in the global art scene."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Youssou N'Dour: I Bring What I Love is a music-driven film that explores one man's power to inspire global change. The film unfolds at a pivotal moment in the life of Youssou N'Dour—the best-selling African pop artist of all time. N'Dour has long been renowned for bringing people of diverse nations and backgrounds together through his collaborations with such musical superstars as Bono, Paul Simon, and Peter Gabriel. But when he releases his most personal and spiritual album yet, he instead alienates his Muslim fans in Africa. Although he garners accolades in the West, N'Dour must brave controversy and rejection at home as he sets out to win his audience back. Director Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi tracks N'Dour's journey over two years – filming his life in Africa, Europe, and America. He initially releases his album Egypt in the hopes of promoting a more tolerant face of Islam. Yet, when his fellow Senegalese reject the album, and denounce it as blasphemous, he takes this as a challenge to go deeper, to reach out to those who would attack him, and to work even harder to use his songs to unite a divided world.

The Straits Times reports that PM Shinzo Abe will be in Hawaii for two days at the end of December to meet with President Obama, and he'll make a stop at the site of the December 7, 1941, Japanese attack (Wednesday is the 75th anniversary) where nearly 2,500 troops and civilians died. The visit—which the White House confirmed in a statement will happen on Dec. 27, per NBC News—seems to be a continuation of goodwill after Obama journeyed to Hiroshima in May to \\"mourn the dead\\" from the world's first atomic strike. On Monday, Abe spoke about Obama's speech then, saying the president's \\"message towards a nuclear-free world during his visit to Hiroshima remains etched into Japanese hearts.\\" And now Abe will return the favor. \\"We must never repeat the horror of war,\\" he said in a televised presser, per the New York Times. \\"I want to express that determination as we look to the future, and at the same time send a message about the value of US-Japanese reconciliation.\\" No itinerary has been released, with Abe simply saying his intent is to \\"comfort the souls of the victims.\\" The founder of the Asia Strategy public policy consultancy tells CNN this is an \\"enormous\\" symbolic gesture on Abe's part, and that by making this move, he's acknowledging how important US-Japan relations are to keeping peace in Asia.

The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below. John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B. Which process would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, process A or process B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Process B Step 1: Identify the processes related to the adrenal glands. Process A is associated with the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' cortex, mainly cortisol and aldosterone. Process B is associated with the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' medulla, mainly adrenaline. Step 2: Determine the function of the hormones in each process. Cortisol and aldosterone, from Process A, help the body deal with stress and regulate the balance of minerals, while adrenaline, from Process B, prepares the body for emergency situations by increasing oxygen and glucose availability to muscles. Step 3: Compare the effects of the hormones on the muscles. In Process A, hormones help with stress and mineral balance, which may not directly affect the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. In Process B, adrenaline directly targets this specific aspect by increasing oxygen and glucose delivery to muscles. Step 4: Answer the question. Based on the information provided, Process B (adrenaline secretion from the adrenal gland's medulla) would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They were both very surprised with they findings. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which scientist read more about grassland fires? Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jian, the scientist who studied grassland soils, read more about grassland fires. This is because grassland fires are mentioned as a significant factor affecting the organic matter contributions from grass roots in grassland ecosystems.

Saturday evening according to LACo fire officials. The park, located on Penn Street near Whittier College, is still closed to the public for the investigation. Dec. 19, 2016. (Leo Jarzomb, SGV Tribune/ SCNG) WHITTIER >> City employees surveyed Penn Park for leaning trees and broken branches, but found no safety issues, hours before a massive eucalyptus tree toppled onto a wedding party, killing a 61-year-old grandmother and injuring seven others. “We have been a Tree City USA for more than 30 years, and take care to manage our urban forest,” Whittier City Manager Jeff Collier said Monday following a press conference at the park. “It’s very rare that this would happen.” Witnesses reported the group was taking pictures beneath the 80- to 90-foot-tall tree at the park on Penn Street, around 4:30 p.m. Saturday when it suddenly uprooted and fell, trapping about 20 people. On Monday, arborists were inspecting the tree to determine what caused it to fall. Collier said they were checking for disease or rot, soil stability and the health of the roots. The tree was more than 50 years old and was last pruned two years ago, said Collier, who called the incident a “freakish situation.” Collier said city employees had given a routine visual inspection of the park the morning before the tree fell and found “no apparent issues.” The wedding party did not have a permit to take photos at the park and city staff were not on site at the time. It wasn’t clear when the experts would come to a conclusion about the cause of the collapse, which was ruled an accident by Los Angeles County Fire Department officials. Coroner’s officials identified the woman who died as Margarita Mojarro, 61, of San Pedro. Officials did not know whether the woman was related to the bride or the groom. She was a mother of four and grandmother of four, according to a family member, who asked for privacy. City, fire and police officials did not have an update on the condition of a 4-year-old girl who was hospitalized in critical condition or the six other adults who were injured by the tree collapse. “Saturday’s tragic accident at Penn Park defies explanation,” Mayor Joe Vinatieri said in a written statement Monday. “The city is investigating and inspecting the park, and will provide answers to many of the questions we all have, including what effect the drought, Friday’s heavy rainfall and other factors may have played in this terrible accident. Those answers will be provided to the family, and our community, as soon as possible.” ||||| The woman killed after a large tree fell on a wedding party taking photos in a Whittier, California park has been identified as the mother of the bride, 61-year-old Margarita Mojarro, a relative has confirmed to PEOPLE. Mojarro, a mother of four from San Pedro, California was pronounced dead at the scene after being pulled out from under the fallen Eucalyptus tree, the Los Angeles County Corner’s office told PEOPLE. An autopsy to determine the exact cause of death is still pending. “Margarita was a very good person and a very loving mom,” Guadalupe Cuevas, whose son is married to Mojarro’s daughter Sonia, told PEOPLE. Coroner IDs woman killed by a falling tree in #Whittier as 61-y/o Margarita Mojarro. Friends say she was mother of the bride. 11:30 on @ABC7 pic.twitter.com/mtNUIVBgBe — Chelsea Edwards (@abc7chelsea) December 19, 2016 The tragic event occurred at 4:30 pm on Saturday while the party for Mojarro’s daughter Patty’s wedding was taking photos in Penn Park. Cuevas did not attend the wedding on Saturday due to an ear problem that makes her sensitive to loud noises, but she said she and Mojarro had taken photos at that same park when her son, Rene, and Mojarro’s daughter, Sonia, were married five years ago. Cuevas heard details about the accident from Rene, who was standing near the tree with his and Sonia’s two sons, ages 8 and 6, when the tree fell. “This was a great tragedy and my son is very traumatized,” Cuevas said. “He’s taking it really hard because his kids were so close to the tree.” Cuevas said Mojarro shared an extremely close bond with all of her daughters and that she was always on hand to help out with her grandchildren. “Margarita’s daughters loved their mom so much, they were always calling her and she was always there to help with anything,” Cuevas said. “She was a very supportive mother, friend and neighbor.” The tree collapse left several people trapped, five of which were transported to area hospitals, most with minor injuries, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said at a press conference Saturday night. The bride’s three-year-old niece, Isabel, was transported to a trauma center in critical condition due to a head injury. Cuevas said the young girl, who is the daughter of Mojarro’s daughter Irma, is improving. “Isabel is progressing and her doctor’s say she’s going to be fine,” she said. Penn Park remains closed as an investigation into the cause of the tree’s collapse is completed. “An independent arborist will be at the park Monday checking that tree to see if they can determine the cause of failure,” Nancy Mendez, Whittier’s Assistant City Manager, told PEOPLE. Mendez said the expert is also evaluating the park’s other large trees to ensure none are showing signs of future collapse. “We will re-open the park if and when all the other trees have been deemed safe,” Mendez said. ||||| Sorry, your browser doesn't support Flash , needs a Flash update , or has Flash disabled.

I have a new situation: David wanted to test the theory of Einstein. To that end, he measured the time perceived by an airline pilot, who naturally traveled very fast. He labeled it as case A. To compare the pilot with a slower traveler he measured the time perceived by a semi truck driver covering the same distance. He labeled it as case B. He was amazed by the counter intuitive results he got from the experiment. But I can use this background: Einstein showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on cause and effect, measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Subatomic particles exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \\"slow down\\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \\"warped\\") by high-speed motion. What is an answer for this question: According to Einstein, would case B perceive the distance shorter or longer than case A?","completion":"According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, case B (the semi-truck driver) would perceive the distance as longer compared to case A (the airline pilot). This is because the pilot is traveling at a higher speed relative to the truck driver, and as a result, experiences time dilation and length contraction. In the pilot's frame of reference, the distance appears shorter, while in the truck driver's frame of reference, the distance appears longer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Hernando Cortes, also known as Hernán Cortés, was a Spanish conquistador who is best known for his role in the conquest of the Aztec Empire in modern-day Mexico. Born in 1485 in Medellín, Spain, he played a significant role in shaping the course of history during the early 16th century. Hernando Cortes died on December 2, 1547, in Castilleja de la Cuesta, a small town located in the province of Seville, Spain. Castilleja de la Cuesta is situated near the larger city of Seville in the Andalusian region of Spain. At the time of his death, Cortes was 62 years old. Cortes' journey had come full circle, as he had departed from Spain with the ultimate goal of exploring and acquiring new territories for the Spanish Crown. Throughout his expeditions, he had several encounters with indigenous peoples, most notably the Aztecs. Cortes eventually formed alliances with some indigenous groups, leading to the fall of the Aztec Empire in 1521. Following his conquests in the New World, Cortes returned to Spain in 1528, where he was received with great honor by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who granted him the title of Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca. However, Cortes soon found himself embroiled in legal battles and conflicts with the Spanish Crown, resulting in a complicated relationship with the royalty. In 1541, Cortes embarked on a final expedition to explore the territories in present-day Mexico, particularly the Baja California peninsula. Unfortunately, this expedition proved unsuccessful, and he returned to Spain in 1547. Cortes spent the last few months of his life living in the town of Castilleja de la Cuesta. It was here that he ultimately passed away, far from the lands he had conquered and the people whose lives he had greatly impacted. In summary, Hernando Cortes, the famed Spanish conquistador who conquered the Aztec Empire, died in Castilleja de la Cuesta, a town located in the province of Seville, Spain, on December 2, 1547. His death marked the end of an extraordinary life filled with exploration, conquest, and controversy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In Sentence 1, the phrase \\"some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine\\" describes a situation where individuals attempt to access the TexTeller machine during the weekend. The words \\"and they have said no\\" imply that the people in charge have denied these individuals' requests to use the machine.

The story begins in England approximately two centuries after the Norman Conquest, or around 1300 A.D. Saxon scholar Walter of Gurnie is the illegitimate son of the Earl of Lessford and has been dispossessed of his inheritance by his father's Norman widow. After joining a group of Saxons who free hostages held by Lessford, Walter is forced into exile when he is recognized. Walter flees England, accompanied by his friend Tristram Griffen, a Saxon archer, and sets out to make his fortune in Cathay during the times of Pax Mongolica. Walter seeks the patronage of Mongol warlord General Bayan of the Hundred Eyes and agrees to fight for him. The \\"Black Rose\\" of the title is the beauteous Maryam, a half-English, half-Mongol girl who has escaped from the harem Bayan is escorting to China. Disguised as a servant boy, she travels with Walter and Tristram in the caravan. Maryam loves Walter, but he is too interested in his adventure to pay her any attention. Tristram doesn't like all the killing and decides to get away. He takes Maryam with him because she wants to go to England. Bayan sends Walter on a mission to see the Sung Dynasty Empress of that part of China not yet under Mongol rule When he arrives he is told that he must stay in China as a \\"guest\\" for the rest of his life.

Step 2: Analyze possible outcomes Considering the cat's agility and athleticism, it weighs the potential outcomes of a successful jump, as well as the risks of a failed attempt. It takes into account factors such as the distance, landing spot, and surrounding obstacles. Step 3: Choose the best strategy Based on its assessment and analysis, the cat decides whether to jump all the way to the floor or find an intermediate landing spot to minimize the risk of injury.

It may also crouch down, gathering energy in its hind legs for a more powerful jump. Step 5: Execute the jump With a burst of energy, the cat leaps off the window, extending its legs to reach the desired landing point. In the event of a sudden change in the surroundings, such as objects entering its path or a change in trajectory, the cat may need to adjust its course mid-air. Step 6: Land safely As it lands, the cat instinctively bends its knees to absorb the impact and gradually distribute its weight across its body. This helps to prevent injuries to its legs and joints, and allows for a graceful landing. Step 7: Assess the result Once on the floor, the cat assesses the success of its jump.

Given the fact that: A decrease in greenhouse gas levels decreases global temperature and an increase raises global temperature. Answer the question: If greenhouse gas were to be halved, the global temperature would increase or decrease?","completion":"If greenhouse gas levels were to be halved, it is expected that global temperatures would decrease. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing temperatures to rise. This is commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect. By reducing the levels of these gases in the atmosphere, less heat would be trapped, leading to a lower overall global temperature. However, the magnitude and rate of temperature decrease would depend on various factors, such as the levels of different greenhouse gases being reduced, the rate at which they are removed from the atmosphere, and the overall climate sensitivity. It is important to note that halving greenhouse gas emissions alone may not be sufficient to reverse the long-term consequences of climate change, as some of the changes are already \\"locked-in\\" due to past emissions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: ['n@re:ndr@ da:mo:d@r'da:s 'mo:di:] ( listen); born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 16th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014. He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Context: During Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies. Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington. During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \\" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \\"spiritual experience\\" for Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election. As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth Rs6.6 trillion were signed. The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4-6% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent - the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992-97 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat. The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India. Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (\\"Guru worthy of worship\\"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children. While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt. The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates. In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans. After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister. Question: Did he generate any groundwater-conservation projects?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi supported NGOs and communities in creating groundwater-conservation projects.

Sentence: \\"accordingly, we recede from any suggestion in pembroke pines that the supreme court's holding in lake county indicates that a court can never separately analyze each of the services funded within an integrated fire services budget to insure that each component survives the required special benefits test.\\" Step 1: Identify the key phrases and terms. - \\"we recede from any suggestion in pembroke pines\\" - \\"supreme court's holding in lake county\\" - \\"a court can never separately analyze\\" - \\"survives the required special benefits test\\" Step 2: Understand the context. The sentence refers to a previous case or decision (Pembroke Pines) and mentions the Supreme Court's holding in another case (Lake County). It discusses the court's ability to analyze services funded within an integrated fire services budget. Step 3: Identify the presence of a constitutionally valid statute or decision that establishes a different rule. The sentence states that \\"we recede from any suggestion in Pembroke Pines\\" and provides an alternative interpretation of the Supreme Court's holding in Lake County. This indicates a shift or change from the previous understanding or application of the law in Pembroke Pines. Step 4: Analyze if the sentence nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent. The sentence suggests that the court is moving away from the understanding or rule established in Pembroke Pines. By doing so, it may impact the legal precedent set by the Pembroke Pines decision. Step 5: Determine if the sentence is overruling or non-overruling.

Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that the Madrigal Ocean is connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. Although this is only an initial analysis, the lower salinity levels observed in the Madrigal Ocean provide valuable insight into the properties and probable sources of incoming water. Salinity, or the concentration of dissolved salts in water, can be influenced by various factors. These factors include evaporation, precipitation, influx of fresh water from sources like rivers and melting glaciers, and the composition of the surrounding geology, among others. The difference in salinity between the Madrigal and Listy Oceans suggests that the inputs and processes affecting these bodies of water are different. Rivers contribute significantly to the supply of fresh water in oceans and seas. When river water, with its typically low salinity, mixes with ocean water, it dilutes the salinity of the ocean. Thus, a greater number of rivers emptying into an ocean generally leads to lower overall salinity in the ocean's surface layers and coastal zones. Considering the much lower salinity of the Madrigal Ocean, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that this body of water receives more fresh water input from rivers compared to the Listy Ocean. The Madrigal Ocean may also be influenced by other factors, such as a higher rate of precipitation or a larger glacial contribution to its water balance. It is crucial to recognize that this conclusion is based only on the limited information we have available at this point. Further research and analysis would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. Some essential aspects to consider are the nature and concentration of the rivers themselves, as the volume of fresh water discharged varies greatly between different rivers. Additionally, the specific geologic, climatic, and oceanographic conditions of the two oceans should also be examined to achieve a comprehensive understanding of their features and any consequent implications. In conclusion, while it's too early to make a definitive statement, current data on salinity suggests that the Madrigal Ocean is likely connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. The lower salinity of the Madrigal Ocean implies that a greater influx of fresh water is diluting the salt concentration. As research and observations on these waters continue, a more accurate picture of their respective properties and interconnections will undoubtedly emerge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: A. dog's mouth B. floor C. garage D. trouble E. nature The answer to this question is:","completion":"D. trouble When cats start ripping things apart, it usually means they are getting into trouble. Cats are naturally curious creatures and have a tendency to explore their environment by interacting with objects, which sometimes involves clawing or ripping apart various items. This behavior can be destructive and may cause problems within the household if the cat is not properly trained or provided with appropriate outlets for their energy and curiosity. The other options provided do not align with the scenario described in the question or with common sense. A \\"dog's mouth\\" (Option A) could imply that the cat is engaging in a risky behavior and might end up being injured by another animal. The \\"floor\\" (Option B) doesn't seem to have any particular relevance to the act of a cat ripping things apart. The \\"garage\\" (Option C) might be a place where a cat could potentially find objects to rip apart, but it is not what the cats are getting into when displaying this behavior. Lastly, \\"nature\\" (Option E) implies an environment in which animals typically find themselves, but it is not the direct result of a cat ripping things apart. Cats getting into trouble can be managed through proper training, providing them with toys or scratching posts to safely engage in their natural instincts, and ensuring their environment is safe and well-suited to meet their needs. Regular playtime to release energy can also help to prevent destructive behaviors, as can providing spaces that are high and accessible for the cat to climb and explore. Positive reinforcement can be used to encourage good behavior, and if the behavior persists, it can be beneficial to consult with a veterinarian or a professional cat behaviorist for additional strategies and support."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nintendo says Wii U won't play DVDs or Blue-ray discs Expect to find some kind of homebrew software that can solve this problem shortly after the Wii U hits the streets. (Mashable) -- Want to play DVDs or Blu-ray discs on your shiny new Nintendo Wii U when it's available sometime next year? You're out of luck. Like its predecessors, Nintendo went with a proprietary 25GB format that looks like it could accommodate Blu-ray discs and DVDs, but can't. Why did the company take away the convenience of being able to watch a movie on the same player used for playing games? Gaming site Kotaku quoted Nintendo president Satoru Iwata: \\"The reason for that is we feel that enough people already have devices that are capable of playing DVDs and Blu-ray, such that it didn't warrant the cost involved to build that functionality into the Wii U console because of the patents related to those technologies.\\" Perhaps Nintendo wanted to keep the price down on the Wii U because of the relatively high cost of that shiny new controller. Either way, you'll probably be able to play DVDs and Blu-ray discs on the Wii U if you really want to, that is, if the hyperactive Wii hacking community of the past is any indication. Expect to find some kind of homebrew software that can solve that problem shortly after the Wii U hits the streets. See the original article on Mashable.com © 2010 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: The family will want to know a little about you, and will definitely ask what kind of experience you have with kids. They might get into more specific questions, too, like how you'd respond if their kid was crying or throwing a fit. Using your prior experience, come up with some good answers to these kinds of questions so you come to the interview confident and prepared. You want to show the parents that you're punctual. They don't want to hire a babysitter that will show up 15 minutes late to the job and make them miss their dinner reservations. You can ask to bring your parent or guardian inside for the interview, telling the family that your parents wanted to meet them before you watch their kids. You can also ask your parent or guardian to give you a ride and have them wait outside in the car. This is an especially important safety tip if you don't know the family and are meeting at their house. You could also ask to meet in a public place, like a coffee shop. Talk about ways you'll keep their kids entertained and safe. Mention your experience doing typical babysitter jobs, like giving kids baths, cooking for them, and putting them to bed. Give the family the phone numbers of a few families you've babysat for in the past, and invite them to call to get an idea of your skills. Remember to confirm with your references before you give out their contact information. Introduce yourself and shake the parents' hands. If their kid(s) are there, bend down and say hi to them too. Sit up straight, make eye contact, and smile during the interview. Show that you're eager for this job and can handle yourself like an adult. Ask them what a typical day in their house looks like, and what kind of things you'd be expected to do as their babysitter. You want to make sure your expectations are in line before you both agree to the job. You could ask, for example, “Will I be cooking for Jimmy when you're out?” or “Will you need me to stay past 11 pm very often?” Tell them if you have sports practice, play rehearsals, or other activities on certain days of the week. Although it might feel awkward to do this in your very first meeting, it's important that they know what your schedule is before they start asking you to come over on days where you have prior commitments. For example, you could say, “I want you to know upfront that I have soccer practices on Mondays and Wednesdays, so I probably won't be able to babysit on those days.” If this is your first babysitting job, ask for 8-10/hour. If you have references or extra qualifications, like CPR or first aid training, ask for a few dollars more. If you're taking care of multiple kids at once, you can also ask for a little more, around 10-15 per hour. You can base your rate on the area you live in. If you live in an expensive city, it's completely acceptable to charge higher rates. If people in your area typically have lower incomes, you'll likely need to charge less. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides guidance for babysitters on how to prepare for and conduct themselves during an interview with a family. Tips include emphasizing punctuality, discussing relevant experience and qualifications, offering references, maintaining a professional demeanor, asking about expectations and responsibilities, being upfront about scheduling constraints, and setting appropriate pay rates based on skills and location.

Keywords: shop, shopper, stroll What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","completion":"Shopping can be an enjoyable and relaxing activity, especially for those who find pleasure in scouting for items they need or appreciate. To create a sentence that includes the keywords \\"shop,\\" \\"shopper,\\" and \\"stroll,\\" we can delve into the context of retail therapy and its benefits. Here it goes. In an effort to unwind from the stress of the week, Jane decided to become an avid shopper for the day, taking a leisurely stroll through her favorite chain of shops in the city's bustling downtown district. The shops, brimming with an array of clothing, accessories, books, and novelty items, allured her with their respective charming uniqueness. The hustle and bustle of the shopkeepers, the rustling of shopping bags, and the hum of the crowd in the backdrop became a comforting symphony for her. Being an intentional shopper, Jane made it a point to not rush through her shopping spree. She adopted a slower pace, taking a stroll down the bright and cheerful lanes, spending time appreciating the craftsmanship of handmade trinkets, and occasionally stopping by the shop windows to try on a stylish hat or appreciate a bespoke piece of jewelry. Her shopping experience wasn't merely about the act of purchasing, instead, it was about savoring the journey, the joy of discovery, and the sheer delight of finding a perfect item that resonated with her unique taste and style. In between her shopping stroll, she found moments to appreciate the city's hustle and bustle, sipping coffee at the quaint cafes dotting the shopping district, and observing fellow shoppers engrossed in similar quests. She reveled in those stolen moments of solitude amidst the cheerful shop chatter, making her shopping experience an amalgamation of exploration, self-discovery, and serenity. Even as the sun started to set, leaving a blush-colored hue on the city skyline, Jane could still be seen happily strolling through the shops, her shopping bags swinging in rhythm to her steps. Her day as a shopper wasn't defined by the number of items bought but by the joyous journey she undertook in the world of shops, creations, and people. Her shopping spree perfectly encapsulates the essence of being a shopper, the joy of the shop-stroll, and the nuanced experiences one can derive from shopping, making it more than a mere transactional activity, but a thoughtful process of selection, appreciation, and celebration. The joys of being a shopper, therefore, extend beyond the confines of a shop, influencing one's personal perspectives, experiences, and connections with the material and the immaterial world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Watching nature, watching people and watching animals communicate with each other provide some of the simplest ways to life's biggest problems. This became clearer to me yesterday. It caused me to ask myself, \\"How do I respond to the storms in life?\\" People usually run when it starts to rain. I love to walk in it, stand on my front door and feel it. I grew up doing it and have never really felt the fear many people do. The animal world senses changes in the weather far earlier than humans. My dog, Ricky, begins to shake long before the storm is close enough to be noticed. I was about to feed my three dogs yesterday and as usual, I let them out in the yard first. They didn't move when thunder came across the skies. So I placed their food in their bowls and called Ricky into the kitchen. Ricky was just standing there in place next to his bowl. The thunder became louder, which forced him to stop eating his meal. Then I watched Phil. He made his way across the kitchen floor and stood over Ricky's bowl. He ate all the remaining food. Generally, if Ricky was standing there, he wouldn't dare come close. But today, he took advantage of the storm and got what he wanted. His hope for the prize outweighed his fear of the storm. That's when it hit me. As men, we face all kinds of storms. They come in unannounced. Sometimes we stay in a corner or under the blankets, hoping it will all pass.

Here are possible answers to this question: - face problems - better themselves - become disillusioned - knowledge - talk to each other I believe the correct choice is \\"better themselves\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Indeed, the primary reason why some people quit work and go back to school is to better themselves. Although various factors might contribute to this decision, the desire for self-improvement and personal growth often stands out as the central driving force. Below, we will explore several interconnected reasons to further elucidate why individuals might choose this path. 1. Career Advancement: One of the primary reasons individuals return to school is to advance their careers. Pursuing higher education often provides an opportunity to gain advanced skills and qualifications that may translate into better job opportunities, promotions, or increased earning potential. This drive for career advancement can sometimes be fueled by the realization that their current work trajectory is not fulfilling their personal or professional goals, ultimately leading them to seek further education. 2. Changing Careers: At times, some people decide to switch careers entirely, necessitating a return to school. This choice might stem from dissatisfaction with their current job, industry changes, or the realization that they would prefer to work in a different field. Gaining qualifications and relevant skills by pursuing higher education is often a crucial step in entering a new career path successfully. 3. Intellectual Curiosity and Passion for Learning: Another factor motivating people to go back to school is a desire to expand their knowledge base. Individuals may be eager to learn more about a particular topic or subject which they're genuinely interested in, driven by a passion for learning and intellectual curiosity. The pursuit of this knowledge can be seen as a means to better themselves both personally and professionally. 4. Personal Growth and Development: Some people recognize that they can benefit from personal growth and self-improvement by seeking further education. They might want to develop better communication skills, critical thinking abilities, or discipline, all of which can be honed through the pursuit of formal education. Additionally, learning new skills and acquiring knowledge can boost self-esteem and confidence, contributing positively to their quality of life. 5. Networking Opportunities: Going back to school provides individuals with the chance to meet and connect with others in their field or industry. These connections can prove valuable in terms of job prospects, collaborations, and gaining insights into the latest trends and developments within their chosen field. Networking can be a great way for people to grow both professionally and personally. 6. Responding to Changing Job Market Requirements: In an ever-evolving world, some fields demand employees to possess a higher level of education or additional skills. When faced with such changes, individuals might find it necessary to return to school to stay competitive in the job market and secure better job opportunities in the future. From the reasons listed above, it is clear that self-improvement or \\"bettering themselves\\" is the underlying motivation for many people who choose to quit work and go back to school. This desire for growth and development, whether professionally, personally, or intellectually, facilitates their decision to invest time, energy, and resources into pursuing further education."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Life today is much easier than it was hundreds of years ago, but it has brought new problems. One of the biggest is pollution. To pollute means to make things dirty. Pollution comes in many ways. We see it, smell it, drink it and even hear it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problem was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in a place, men moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad to all living things in the world, but it is not only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills fish and pollutes drinking water. Noise pollution makes us become angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight against pollution. They stop the people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from blowing dirty smoke into the air. The pollution of SO2 is now the most dangerous problem of air pollution. It is mostly caused by heavy traffic. It is certain that if there are fewer people driving, there will be less air pollution. The earth is our home. We must take care of it.

Question 1: Imagine you have 10 different stickers with numbers from 0 to 9. You want to make a 3-digit number using them, but you can't use the same sticker twice. So, for the first digit (the hundreds place), you have 9 choices (1 to 9, because you can't use 0 at the beginning). After you choose that sticker, you will have 9 stickers left. You can choose any of those 9 stickers for the second digit (the tens place). After that, you will have 8 stickers left, and you can pick one of them for the last digit (the ones place). So, let's count the ways you can do this: 9 choices for the 1st place x 9 choices for the 2nd place x 8 choices for the 3rd place = 9x9x8 = 648 So, you can make 648 different 3-digit numbers without repeating any digits. Question 2: Now, in this story, you have the same 10 number stickers, but you're allowed to use the same sticker as many times as you want. The first place (hundreds) still has only 9 choices (1 to 9, since 0 can't be the first digit). But for the second and the third places (tens and ones), you can choose among all 10 stickers. So, let's count the ways you can do this: 9 choices for the 1st place x 10 choices for the 2nd place x 10 choices for the 3rd place = 9x10x10 = 900 So, you can make 900 different 3-digit numbers with repetitions allowed.

Movie plot title: Plane Dead Movie plot: On a routine flight from Los Angeles to Paris, a renegade group of scientists has smuggled aboard a secret container holding a fellow scientist infected with a deadly genetically engineered virus which reanimates the dead. The virus is a variant of the virus malaria created by three scientists. They discovered and manufactured the virus with the intent of turning it into a biological weapon. Their goal was to produce soldiers who could continue fighting, even while mortally wounded. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. The infected have superhuman abilities, sprinting and leaping beyond human capabilities. The zombies become very durable, and a particular zombie survives despite being thrown into a plane's engine. The 747 jumbo jet encounters massive thunderstorms, and the turbulence releases one of the scientists from the cargo hold. Two of the scientists go below to ascertain if the container has been damaged by the turbulence, and are also killed, starting a zombie outbreak. The uninfected passengers must fight for survival aboard the flight. No government will allow the infected airliner to land, leaving the survivors stranded in the sky with their ravenous tormentors.

Article: As he looks up at the Jade Dragon Mountain, Zhang Jinpeng basks in the sunshine on the roof-top of his youth hostel in Lijiang, a popular tourist destination in Yunnan province in Southwest China. He is content and excited at the same time, since the hostel, which he named after his best-seller A Decade of Backpacking, opened earlier this month. Published in 2010, Zhang's book was considered a milestone in Chinese travel writing. It sold more than 600,000 copies and triggered a wave of travel books by other Chinese writers who were born in the late 1970s and 1980s. Different from travel guides and traditional Chinese travel literature that mainly depict landscapes and scenery, these books by young travelers tell stories of their personal growth through traveling. In A Decade of Backpacking, Zhang recounts his travels around the world since 2001, after he graduated from Nan Kai University in Tianjin and decided to see the world. \\"At the time my book came out, there were few books that catered to young people's longing while traveling.\\" Zhang's book ignited a Chinese craze for travel writing. Featuring different themes, travel writing became a popular genre. But most of the books have one thing in common: The travelers are mostly young people. The Late Gap Year (2009), written by Sun Dongchun, tells the story of a young man who gave up a white-collar job and started a three-month trip for a volunteer program in Southeast Asia. The trip turned into a year-long travel. What's more, he even found his Miss Right and got married by the end of the story. We Always Travel Hand in Hand, published in 2012, was written by a young couple. Their travel romance, complete with beautiful pictures, first went viral on a Chinese micro-blog. Song Zhenshao, counselor at the psychological counseling center of Beijing Normal University, says: \\"To step out of ordinary life is a deep desire associated with freedom in people's hearts, and the hustle and bustle of city life intensifies the desire.\\" But as more similar travelogues...

Q:Given the below context: Poulenc made his début as a composer in 1917 with his Rapsodie nègre, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call \\"leg-Poulenc\\". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot. In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being. Cocteau, though similar in age to Les Six, was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, \\"paradoxical and lapidary\\" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of Les Six collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite L'Album des Six consists of six separate and unrelated pieces.... Guess a valid title for it!

The other involves the political and military leaders trying to contain the epidemic. Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David, his girlfriend, nurse Judy, and firefighter Clank. David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks arrive in town, led by Major Ryder, who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying an untested bioweapon crash-landed in the hills near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \\"Trixie,\\" causing victims to either die or become homicidally insane. \\"Trixie\\" is highly contagious, with anyone drinking from the Evans City reservoir becoming affected.

What figure in Greek mythology was killed by a wild boar? What is the answer?","completion":"The figure in Greek mythology who was killed by a wild boar is Adonis. Adonis was a beautiful youth and a symbol of beauty and desire in Greek mythology. He was born from the unconventional union of Myrrha (or Smyrna), who was transformed into a myrrh tree by the gods after having an incestuous affair with her father, King Cinyras of Cyprus. The tree was then split open, and Adonis emerged as a fully grown, handsome young man. Adonis was loved by both the goddess Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, and Persephone, the goddess of the underworld and wife of Hades. This led to a bitter feud between the two goddesses, as each wanted to keep Adonis for themselves. Eventually, the dispute was taken to Zeus, the king of the gods, who decided that Adonis should spend one-third of the year with Aphrodite, one-third with Persephone, and the remaining third was up to him. Adonis chose to spend his extra time with Aphrodite. Adonis was an avid hunter and enjoyed spending time in the wilderness. One day while he was out hunting, he encountered a wild boar. It is believed that Ares, the god of war and Aphrodite's lover, grew jealous of Adonis and transformed himself into the wild boar. The boar charged at Adonis, and in the struggle that followed, Adonis was fatally wounded by its tusks. When Aphrodite heard the news of Adonis's death, she was consumed by grief. In her sorrow, she created the anemone flower, which is said to have sprung from the blood of Adonis. The death of Adonis is an integral part of Greek mythology, symbolizing the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. His tragic story has been subject to numerous interpretations, with the main theme being the fleeting nature of beauty and youth and the inevitable tragedy of love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: King Solomon's Mines Movie plot: Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) hires Allan Quatermain to find her father, believed lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the band who played Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio? Following a life-threatening drug addiction that developed after leaving the Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante completed a month of drug rehabilitation at Las Encinas in Pasadena in 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the band. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio. The writing and formation of By the Way began immediately following the culmination of Californication's world tour, in the spring of 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: \\"We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it.\\" Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, \\"writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence.\\" Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.

But even as it attempts to play the Russia card, the government of President Hassan Rouhani is simultaneously stressing closer bilateral ties with Vladimir Putin's Kremlin as a means of mitigating the impact of US, EU and UN economic sanctions, imposed in the still-unresolved row over Iran's nuclear programme. \\"The western countries are imposing sanctions on Russia [after its annexation of Crimea]. Now Russia is the bad guy,\\" said Amir Mohebbian, a government adviser. \\"This has made the situation better for Iran's nuclear negotiators. Time is on our side. If we sit here long enough, it will all come to Iran.\\" It was not for Iran to say who was right or wrong in Ukraine, said Mohammad Marandi, an international relations expert at Tehran University. \\"But of course if Iran is no longer under sanctions, the Europeans would have many more choices regarding energy. At the same time, if the sanctions continue, Rouhani may move closer to Russia and China.\\" Majid Takht Ravanchi, deputy foreign minister and a member of Iran's nuclear negotiating team, said Iran would focus solely on details of a deal to lift sanctions when nuclear talks resumed in Vienna this week. But he did not deny Ukraine had placed matters in a new light. \\"Naturally Iran and Europe could have much better cooperation on the economy, trade, energy. We believe there is much room for improvement,\\" Ravanchi said. The extent to which Iran could become Europe's alternative energy supplier is borne out by statistics, and by growing western commercial interest in its energy sector. Iran is the third largest Opec oil producer after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. It controls an estimated about 13% of the world's recoverable crude oil reserves and the world's second largest natural gas reserves. Despite sanctions that severely limit cash sales of Iranian energy, an international oil, gas, refining and petrochemicals exhibition in Tehran last week attracted 1,800 companies, among them 600 foreign companies from 32 countries including the US and Britain. China is one of Iran's biggest customers, owing an estimated 22bn (£13bn) for oil and gas supplies, which cannot be paid due to banking sanctions. Details emerged last week of plans for China to invest an equivalent sum in electricity and water projects as a way of circumventing the restrictions. Similar barter deals are now in the pipeline with Russia. Last month the Mehr news agency reported a planned 8bn-10bn energy deal in which Russia would supply electricity, generating plants and a transmission network. The US says an earlier proposal for Iran to supply 500,000 barrels of oil a day in return for Russian products would violate sanctions. Speaking last month as the Ukraine crisis intensified, Rouhani went out of his way to praise Russia. \\"Strong political ties in bilateral, regional and international domains, along with vast economic relations between the two countries, set the stage for the promotion of peace and stability,\\" he said. Rouhani's message to the west was plain: if there is no deal to end sanctions, Iran has strategic alternatives that the US, Britain and others may find unpalatable. Western analysts worry the Iran-Russia relationship may expand into the security sphere. Concern centres on the sale of Russian advanced S-300 advanced anti-missile defence systems, which would provide Iran with state-of-the-art protection in the event of a hypothetical Israeli or American attack. The sale, agreed in 2007, was blocked after Putin came under international pressure. But if Moscow's relations with the west deteriorate further, it is possible Russia's president could give it the green light. Iran insists, meanwhile, that its missile capabilities, both offensive and defensive, cannot be part of talks with the west. Despite the election victory of the more centrist Rouhani administration, Iran remains deeply at odds with the US on a range of other fronts extending beyond Russia and the nuclear talks. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other hardline clerics persist in casting the US in the role of \\"Great Satan\\" or \\"global arrogance\\". They continue to castigate Israel at every opportunity, although former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's notorious threat to wipe it off the map is no longer repeated. Iran is also embroiled in a regional power struggle with the key US ally, Saudi Arabia, and other Sunni Muslim Gulf states. This so-called proxy war has found its sharpest expression in Syria, where the Sunni-Shia divide is most evident, but it also extends to Bahrain, Yemen and even Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. A Tehran official said Iran was intent on curtailing the spread of extremist Wahhabi ideology and jihadism that flowed from Saudi Arabia's \\"wealthy mosques, teachers and banks\\". But there was also unanimous agreement on another, overriding objective: fulfilling Iran's destiny as the leading power of the Middle East, the official said. The US should not try to thwart this ambition, said Mohebbian. \\"We need a new dynamic. The US and Iran should agree not to be friends and not to be enemies. The US [and Europe] should accept Iran as it is. It will be better for them not to have Iran as an enemy. It would be expensive for them in the long run, more than they can imagine.\\" Summary:","completion":"The crisis in Ukraine has made Iran more valuable to Europe and the United States as a potential alternative energy supplier, since they can't rely on Russia as much. This situation has strengthened Iran's position in nuclear talks and other dealings with the West. At the same time, Iran is working on building closer ties with Russia to help lessen the impact of economic sanctions from the US, European Union, and United Nations. Iran has a large amount of oil and natural gas reserves, which could make it a good alternative energy source for Europe if sanctions were to be lifted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph: So far, we have discussed elements and compounds that are electrically neutral. They have the same number of electrons as protons, so the negative charges of the electrons is balanced by the positive charges of the protons. However, this is not always the case. Electrons can move from one atom to another; when they do, species with overall electric charges are formed. Such species are called ions. Species with overall positive charges are termed cations, while species with overall negative charges are called anions. Remember that ions are formed only when electrons move from one atom to another; a proton never moves from one atom to another. Compounds formed from positive and negative ions are called ionic compounds. Individual atoms can gain or lose electrons. When they do, they become monatomicions. When atoms gain or lose electrons, they usually gain or lose a characteristic number of electrons and so take on a characteristic overall charge. Table 3.6 \\"Monatomic Ions of Various Charges\\" lists some common ions in terms of how many electrons they lose (making cations) or gain (making anions). There are several things to notice about the ions in Table 3.6 \\"Monatomic Ions of Various Charges\\". First, each element that forms cations is a metal, except for one (hydrogen), while each element that forms anions is a nonmetal. This is actually one of the chemical properties of metals and nonmetals: metals tend to form cations, while nonmetals tend to form anions. Second, most atoms form ions of a single characteristic charge. When sodium atoms form ions, they always form a 1+ charge, never a 2+ or 3+ or even 1− charge. Thus, if you commit the information in Table 3.6 \\"Monatomic Ions of Various Charges\\"to memory, you will always know what charges most atoms form. (In Chapter 9 \\"Chemical Bonds\\", we will discuss why atoms form the charges they do. ) Table 3.6 Monatomic Ions of Various Charges H+ Na+ K+ Ions formed by losing a single electron. Q: Electrons can move from one atom to another; when they do, specimens called what, with overall electric charges, are formed? A: Available options: - atoms; - molecules; - cations; - ions;","completion":"When electrons move from one atom to another, species with overall electric charges are formed.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An abandoned ship crashes into a dockyard in Brooklyn, New York, and the ship inspector, Silas Green, finds it full of corpses. Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a suave, mysterious vampire (who arrived on the ship in his intricately carved coffin), intervenes and kills them. Soon after, Maximillian infects Julius with his vampiric blood, before Julius turning into a decaying ghoul and claiming that it has benefits; he then explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the Dhampir daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon. This Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, who is still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, are in the middle of investigating the murders on the ship, Rita begins having strange visions about a woman who looks like her, and begins asking questions about her mother's past. When she tells Justice about having \\"a strange feeling\\" about the investigation, he is skeptical, which frustrates Rita. The visions are presumably influenced in part by her vampire heritage; this is hinted at a few times throughout the first two-thirds of the story. Rita is completely unaware of this heritage, and believes she is losing her mind, similar to what happened to her mother. Meanwhile, Maximillian initiates a series of sinister methods to find out more about Rita and to further pull her into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook. Max, in these disguises, misleads Rita into thinking Justice slept with Nikki,...

(CNN)Opening statements begin Tuesday in the trial of Kendrick Johnson's parents in a case growing increasingly controversial after reports that a Georgia judge had the media removed from his courtroom. Exactly what happened is unclear, as The Valdosta Daily Times reported that its reporter, a citizen journalist and two television reporters were escorted out of the courtroom by a Lowndes County Sheriff's Office deputy who said she was following State Court Judge Mark Mitchell's order and offered no further explanation. However, the Johnsons' attorney, Chevene King, said that only CNN affiliate WCTV-TV had its reporter booted from the courtroom. WCTV had no reporting to that effect on its website, nor did CNN affiliate WTXL-TV.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: The Road from Climate Science to Climate Advocacy Richard C. J. Somerville, a climatologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography near San Diego, is one of a growing array of scientists who have chosen to move beyond studying heat transfer and cloud physics and take on the role of activist: prodding society to move aggressively to cut greenhouse gases. It is a sticky position, and comes with risks, not the least of which is the potential for opponents of gas restrictions to raise questions about a scientist-advocateâs objectivity back in the research world. But Dr. Somerville, who has also contributed to several reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says the risks that attend further silence, in the face of ever-growing emissions of heat-trapping gases, are far greater. Last month, he attended the climate-treaty talks in Bali as part of a small delegation representing 200 scientists who signed a declaration pressing negotiators to commit to preventing the global temperature from rising more than 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit above where it is now (roughly 59 degrees). He has just written a column for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists explaining why this group of researchers chose this course, and what they feel needs to happen next. His column is online here. The 2007 IPCC report, compiled by several hundred climate scientists, has unequivocally concluded that our climate is warming rapidly, and that we are now at least 90% certain that this is mostly due to human activities. The amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere now far exceeds the natural range of the past 650,000 years, and it is rising very quickly due to human activity. If this trend is not halted soon, many millions of people will be at risk from extreme events such as heat waves, drought, floods and storms, our coasts and cities will be threatened by rising sea levels, and many ecosystems, plants and animal species will be in serious danger of extinction. The next round of focused negotiations for a new global climate treaty (within the 1992 UNFCCC process) needs to begin in December 2007 and be completed by 2009. The prime goal of this new regime must be to limit global warming to no more than 2 ÂºC above the pre-industrial temperature, a limit that has already been formally adopted by the European Union and a number of other countries. Based on current scientific understanding, this requires that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by at least 50% below their 1990 levels by the year 2050. In the long run, greenhouse gas concentrations need to be stabilised at a level well below 450 ppm (parts per million; measured in CO2-equivalent concentration). In order to stay below 2 ÂºC, global emissions must peak and decline in the next 10 to 15 years, so there is no time to lose. As scientists, we urge the negotiators to reach an agreement that takes these targets as a minimum requirement for a fair and effective global climate agreement. In an email exchange, I asked Dr. Somerville what he thought was needed in order to spark the changes the letter seeks. He responded, âI think a dramatic shocking surprising climate event that is unambiguously due to global warming may be the only thing that motivates people and governments. Maybe a big chunk of ice sheet destabilizing and producing a significant sudden sea level rise. Unfortunately, then it may be too late, because it’s essentially irreversible; you can’t cool the world enough to make the ice re-form quickly.” I followed up this way: âWas the declaration more a way for scientists at least to say, âLook we’ve done everything we can do?ââ âMaybe, for some,” Dr. Somerville responded. “It’s hard to say. We wordsmithed the Bali declaration and then just invited some good scientists to sign. They didn’t get a chance to explain why they did or did not decide to sign. Some did not sign, because they thought even deeper emissions cuts are needed. Some could not sign, because their jobs did not allow them to make public policy statements (some civil servants in other countries are in this category). It is very tough in general to get scientists to make policy advocacy statements. It goes against the grain. They are more comfortable just doing research. Some scientists are opposed to any scientist doing any form of policy advocacy. Most are politically naive, I should think. I certainly am.” “For me, and maybe for many, I think that ‘going public’ and making a statement as an individual, who is also a climate expert, is simply a next logical step,” Dr. Somerville said. “After all, many politicians have said that scientists should be heard from more. As long as we are always at pains to make clear that we are speaking only as individuals, not on behalf of our employers or other organizations, then I think we are just behaving as good citizens.” He concluded: “It’s certainly true too that many of us are disappointed and frustrated that the climate negotiations have produced so little so far. I am. The negotiators often seem to me to have forgotten the basic reason why these meetings exist. The science is not very visible at the negotiations. Unless the negotiations can find the political will to agree on enforceable and meaningful (= large) cuts in emissions, the climate is going to degrade. That’s just a fact.” Other scientists disagree with this kind of activism, most notably Susan Solomon, who was the co-leader of the 2007 I.P.C.C. assessment of climate trends. In an email exchange on the general issue of scientists and policy debate last weekend (just before she flew to Antarctica), she said: âIf we as scientists go beyond what we know into our personal opinions and values, we begin to engage in the same sort of personal speculation masquerading as authoritative that we dislike when it is done by the skeptics.â Do scientists have a special obligation to be neutral when it comes to the implications of their findings for society more broadly? Is it possible to advocate for a particular course in climate policy and not have that color how you do your scientific research, or how you communicate it?","completion":"This news article is about a scientist named Richard Somerville who studies the Earth's climate. He is worried about the bad things that can happen because of climate change, like more heat waves, droughts, floods, storms, and animals going extinct. He believes we need to make some changes quickly to protect our planet. Some other scientists agree with him and want to work together to help fix the problem. However, some scientists don't like his activism and think they should just focus on studying the climate.

If you like Grey's Dr. McDreamy, you'll like Tom and the movie. If not? There are plenty of other nondescript romantic comedies out there from which to choose. 2. A film so dreadful and humiliating that it's reassuring to know Dempsey can keep his day job. 3. Movies like this make Cupid want to change careers. 4. At its best, a romantic comedy celebrates one of humanity's greatest yearnings: to give and to find the love of a lifetime. At its worst (and this is where Made of Honor comes in), it can leave you with a bad taste, not just in your mouth but in your soul 5. Certain formula-driven romantic comedies reach a point where the audience realizes it won't be much fun watching the main character get his way. Nor will it be much fun watching him get his comeuppance. This is not where you want your audience. 6. Not good, not bad, just there, the film faithfully crosses off one timeworn cliché after the next. 7. The plotting ranges from predictable to ridiculous and with the exception of a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, Dempsey's frequent shirtlessness is the film's main appeal. The rest is as unpalatable as stale wedding cake. 8. It's touching work that makes Dempsey's plastic sincerity look as thin as the film's posters. 9. Made of Honor is the kind of formulaic fare -- there's even that turn-the-car-around-and-get-me-back-to-the-church moment -- that depends on the wit of the script and the spark of its stars. In those departments, the film is just middling. 10. Overly familiar and predictable. Its debts to both When Harry Met Sally and My Best Friend's Wedding are considerable.","completion":"The movie \\"Made of Honor\\" received mixed reviews from various critics. Some viewers enjoyed Dempsey's performance, such as in the first review where it states that if you like Grey's Dr. McDreamy, you will like Tom and the movie. However, others found the film to be lacking in originality and regrettable, with the second review calling it \\"dreadful and humiliating.\\" The third review goes as far as to say that it makes Cupid want to change careers. Many reviews found \\"Made of Honor\\" to be a formulaic romantic comedy. The fourth review criticizes it for not celebrating love but instead leaving audiences with a bad taste in their mouth and in their soul. The fifth review suggests that audiences may not enjoy watching the main character achieve his goals or face consequences for his actions. The sixth review describes the film as mediocre, simply checking off clichés throughout its runtime. There are a few positive aspects mentioned in the reviews, such as some laughs and Dempsey's shirtless scenes noted in the seventh review. However, the overall plot is called predictable and ridiculous. Review eight describes Dempsey's performance as plastic and not as genuine as the movie poster might have suggested. The ninth review acknowledges that \\"Made of Honor\\" relies on the wit of the script and the spark of its stars, but finds these elements to be merely average. The tenth review emphasizes the film's predictability and unoriginality, comparing it to other popular romantic comedies like \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"My Best Friend's Wedding,\\" to which it owes much of its plot. In summary, \\"Made of Honor\\" is a formulaic romantic comedy with mixed reception, and its overall success largely depends on the viewer's enjoyment of Dempsey's performance. While some praise it for its light-hearted humor and shirtless scenes, others criticize it for its predictable, cliché plot and lack of originality."},{"prompt":"Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Joy is left on her own with? , can you please find it? 18-year-old Joy starts her catalogue of bad choices by running away from home with Tom.

He knew that his friends all had bicycles. It was hard to hang around with people when you were the only one without wheels. He thought about what he could do. It was no use asking his parents, for he knew they had no money to save. There was only one way to get money, and that was to earn it. He would have to find a job. But who would hire him and what could he do?

Question: If Mona is building a lens for looking at the stars and she wants to make sure it refracts less light then the one she previously built, will she need to make the surface more or less curved then the one before less or more? Text: The more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it refracts the light that passes through it.","completion":"Based on the provided text, if Mona is building a lens for looking at the stars and she wants to make sure it refracts less light than the one she previously built, she will need to make the surface less curved than the one before. The text states that \\"the more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it refracts the light that passes through it.\\" This means that if the curvature of the lens surface is increased, more refraction of light will occur. Refraction is the bending or changing of the light's direction as it passes through a lens. In Mona's case, she wants to reduce the light refraction, so she needs to decrease the curvature of the lens surface. By making the lens surface less curved, less light will be refracted, and this will allow her to have a clearer and more focused view of the stars. This is important in astronomy, as less refraction allows for clearer images of celestial bodies and better light transmission, resulting in better visibility and improved observation. In summary, to achieve a lens with less light refraction, Mona should construct her new lens with a surface that is less curved than the one she previously built. This will provide her with a clearer view of the stars and help her achieve her objective in building a better lens for stargazing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The cardinals who must pick a successor to Pope Benedict XVI after he steps down on February 28 could meet to make the decision sooner than thought, a Vatican spokesman said Saturday. The conclave, the meeting which will bring together the 117 cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, could start before March 15 if all the cardinals are already in Rome, Father Federico Lombardi said. Lombardi had previously said the conclave was likely to start between March 15 and 19. But he gave new details Saturday, saying that because the pope had resigned rather than the conclave being triggered by his death, there was scope for the time frame to be brought forward. Benedict is the first pope to step down in nearly 600 years, throwing the","completion":"Vatican into uncharted territory for selecting a new leader. Although there are no official candidates, several cardinals have been mentioned as potential successors, among them Cardinal Angelo Scola of Italy, Cardinal Odilo Pedro Scherer of Brazil, and Cardinal Peter Erdo of Hungary. Given the unique situation, Vatican officials have been reviewing the Apostolic Constitution, the document that outlines the regulations for selecting the Pope. This examination has led to the possibility of an earlier conclave, so long as all cardinals are present in Rome. While the early start could expedite the selection process, some argue that it may not provide enough time for pre-conclave discussions, during which cardinals are able to evaluate potential candidates and address any issues facing the Church. Nonetheless, the Vatican remains committed to ensuring a smooth and efficient transition of power. As cardinals from around the world gather in Rome over the coming weeks, they will participate in a series of meetings and private consultations to discern the qualities needed in the next Pope. The conclave itself will be held in the Sistine Chapel and will continue until a new Pope is elected by a two-thirds majority. The election of the new Pope, who will serve as the spiritual leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, comes at a critical time for the Church as it faces numerous challenges, including declining membership in some regions, ongoing sexual abuse scandals, and internal divisions.

Estate agent George Low, 22, from Dartford, was stabbed in the neck near a nightclub in Ayia Napa on the Greek side of the border on Sunday. Police were told it happened after a row about urinating in the street. Arrest warrants were issued for Mehmet Akpinar, 22, and Sali Ahmet, 42, who were detained late on Friday. The men, thought to be Turkish Cypriots, were detained on the Turkish side of the island for an offence unconnected to the stabbing, said deputy police chief of the Famagusta region George Economou, \\"They appeared in court this morning [on the Turkish side] over this unconnected offence and have been remanded in custody for three days,\\" he said. \\"I am now waiting to hear what will happen at the end of those three days.\\" The investigation into Mr Low's murder has been carried out by Greek Cypriot police but they have no jurisdiction in the Turkish-controlled north of the island. Mr Low's mother Helen, 47, welcomed the development. \\"We have not heard anything official from CID, but we are aware of the reports and are overjoyed,\\" she said. \\"We just want justice for George and Ben, who has been left traumatised by all this.\\" Mrs Low said her son's body had not yet been flown back to the UK to allow preparations for his funeral to go ahead. Police have also issued a warrant for a third man suspected to have helped the suspects escape to the Turkish side. Mr Low, a former club manager in Ayia Napa, and his friend Ben Barker are believed to have been stabbed after a row broke out. Mr Barker, 22, received knife wounds to his back in the attack in Grigori Axfentiou Street, but survived. Mr Economou said earlier this week his officers were told the two British men were urinating in the street and two Turkish Cypriot men told them not to, which led to the argument. He said the assailants allegedly returned with a knife about 10 minutes later. The group did not know each other beforehand. A 48-year-old woman taken into custody pending further inquiries - but not charged - is said to be the girlfriend of Mr Akpinar and is accused of taking him a fresh pair of clothes and retrieving his mobile phone.

Question: What is the name of the mysterious speaking giraffe? Title: The Seven of Daran: Battle of Pareo Rock Movie plot: 11-year-old boy Jimmy Westwood (Johann Harmse) lives in South-Africa with his mother. The young girl Charita (Ketrice Maitisa) from the Saladir tribe lives alone in the city and works on the street cleaning car windows. One day she cleans the windows of the car of Jimmy and his mother, without asking; she does not get paid. Later she takes revenge by stealing Jimmy's wallet. Jimmy goes after her and asks the wallet back. This happens at a market where a small white giraffe is sold through an auction. It can talk and tells Jimmy that he has to prevent an upcoming war between two tribes, the Bombattas and the Saladir. It gives Jimmy a magical pendant. Jimmy frees the giraffe. With Charita he runs away, chased by the owner who sold the giraffe but had not delivered it yet to the buyer. They are arrested and locked up by the police. Charita returns the wallet to Jimmy, withholding money for cleaning the car windows. They are friends now. Jimmy is released when his mother comes to collect him. The mother of their maid knows about the giraffe, and explains to Jimmy that it is one of the \\"seven of Daran\\", magical animals which each watch over one continent. This convinces Jimmy that he has to do what the giraffe instructed him to do. He leaves a note for his mother that he is going on a mission, and frees Charita from the police cell. Together they go to the war zone to be, to prevent the war, as Jimmy was told to do by the giraffe.

He is not necessarily talking about where he pitches the off-breaks that made him a valuable contributor in last summer’s T20, or the weight of his new bat. The 32-year-old is just as likely to be explaining his analysis of an afternoon’s runners. A new three-year deal has just been signed with his county but Smith is planning for a longer-term future which he hopes will be played out on a different form of turf. Hampshire cricket all-rounder Will Smith says he has been hooked on racing since he was five-years-old. Smith said he would like to go into racing punditry when he finishes playing cricket in six or seven years time. Racing fan Smith (left) talks to Sportsmail's Marcus Townend (right) at Kempton. 1 VAUTOUR: Quite simply, wins the Arkle Chase at the Cheltenham Festival by 10 lengths! 2 FAUGHEEN: Wins the Champion Hurdle by five lengths! 3 BRIAR HILL: Fell in last season’s Albert Bartlett Hurdle but had previously beaten first and third Very Wood and Apache Jack at Naas, giving them weight. 4 CAPOTE: Soft ground staying chaser who should prove better than his hurdling form. 5 ELENIKA: Very well handicapped for steeplechasing and goes well fresh. 6 CHAMPAGNE AT TARA: Will prove better upped in trip and nicely handicapped. 7 OUR JOEY: Highly rated by Cumbrian trainer George Bewley. Soft ground will suit him well. 8 MANY CLOUDS: Can win a high-class handicap chase between 2m4f-3m. 9 GOLDEN CHIEFTAIN: Ran well on reappearance at Cheltenham. Runs in Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton this afternoon. 10 SHUTTHEFRONTDOOR: Looks suited to the Grand National. On Wednesday he was the studio expert for subscription channel Racing UK, interpreting the action from Nottingham and Warwick. During the winter months, Smith can also be found offering useful advice to punters via William Hill radio. Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs, won four County Championship medals (three with Durham and one with Nottinghamshire) and was a member of the Hampshire team which won this year’s Division Two to gain promotion. But he has an equal passion for horseracing. He said: ‘My father used to take me and my older brother to Towcester every Boxing Day and Easter Monday. I loved everything about a racecourse, the atmosphere, the smells. I was five or six and it got me hooked. ‘Throughout my teenage years I always studied the form in the hope of making a pound or two. I have always had an analytical mind so I enjoyed that side of it. ‘Two winters ago, I was coming into the last year of my contract with Durham. It was up in the air whether I would get another deal because of their financial troubles. ‘I thought I might have to do something else so I thought “what do I have a passion for?”’ The cricketer, who captained Durham as they retained their title in the 2009 season, said: ‘I pestered the (RUK) producer with emails and didn’t let him have a moment’s peace because I was so keen. I love doing the punditry. It is ideally where I would like to be once the cricket finishes even if, hopefully, that is another six or seven years down the line.’ Smith revealed that in 2009 he was unsure whether he would get a new Durham contract so was f. Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs and has won four County Championship medals. Smith captained current England skipper Alastair Cook when the two were at Bedford School together. Smith, who took three for 15 when a losing semi-finalist in the T20 finals in August, has a cricket pedigree as rich as some of the racehorses he analyses. His fielding skills earned him a stint as a substitute fielder for England while on the Notts staff and, prior to playing for British Universities, he captained current England skipper Alastair Cook while they were contemporaries at Bedford School. Smith said: ‘He was 4ft 2in and I don’t think his voice had broken but you could tell he had a bit of talent. I was No 3 and Alastair opened with James Stedman, who went on to play hockey for England. ‘They put on numerous double hundred partnerships so I spent a lot of my time with my pads on not doing a lot.’ Smith, married to Catherine with two daughters, Ava, three, and Daisy, six months, believes his interest in racing acts as a useful diversion from the demands of the county circuit. He said: ‘If you are just watching the cricket you become a little too intense about it, or I do anyway. Also at night time you just want to switch off. ‘I go out for a meal with team-mates and then can sit back and watch the racing I have missed and catch up on the form.’ Another result at Hampshire suggests Smith has not given his team-mates too many losing tips — he was voted Players’ Player of the Year for 2014.

Joseph Conrad (Polish pronunciation: ['juzef ,kon.rad]; born Jozef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski; 3 December 1857 - 3 August 1924) was a Polish-British writer regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. He joined the British merchant marine in 1878, and was granted British citizenship in 1886. Though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he was a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature. He wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an impassive, inscrutable universe. After the publication of Chance in 1913, Conrad was the subject of more discussion and praise than any other English writer of the time. He had a genius for companionship, and his circle of friends, which he had begun assembling even prior to his first publications, included authors and other leading lights in the arts, such as Henry James, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, John Galsworthy, Edward Garnett, Garnett's wife Constance Garnett (translator of Russian literature), Stephen Crane, Hugh Walpole, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Norman Douglas, Jacob Epstein, T. E. Lawrence, Andre Gide, Paul Valery, Maurice Ravel, Valery Larbaud, Saint-John Perse, Edith Wharton, James Huneker, anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski, Jozef Retinger (later a founder of the European Movement, which led to the European Union, and author of Conrad and His Contemporaries). Conrad encouraged and mentored younger writers. In the early 1900s he composed a short series of novels in collaboration with Ford Madox Ford. In 1919 and 1922 Conrad's growing renown and prestige among writers and critics in continental Europe fostered his hopes for a Nobel Prize in Literature. Interestingly, it was apparently the French and Swedes - not the English - who favoured Conrad's candidacy. In April 1924 Conrad, who possessed a hereditary Polish status of nobility and coat-of-arms (Nalecz), declined a (non-hereditary) British knighthood offered by Labour Party Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. Conrad kept a distance from official structures -- he never voted in British national elections -- and seems to have been averse to public honours generally; he had already refused honorary degrees from Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Yale universities. In the Polish People's Republic, translations of Conrad's works were openly published, except for Under Western Eyes, which in the 1980s was published as an underground \\"bibula\\". Conrad's narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors, including T. S. Eliot, Maria Dabrowska, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Gerald Basil Edwards, Ernest Hemingway, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Andre Malraux, George Orwell, Graham Greene, William Golding, William Burroughs, Saul Bellow, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Peter Matthiessen, John le Carre, V. S. Naipaul, Philip Roth, Joan Didion, Thomas Pynchon J. M. Coetzee, and Salman Rushdie. Many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, Conrad's works.

Kellie, 61, is now undergoing a raft of cosmetic treatments to become a woman. This week she had a state-of-the-art semi-permanent make-up treatment at Harley Street clinic Debra Robson LDN. Scroll down for video. Transformation: Kellie Maloney has undergone a two-hour semi-permanent make-up treatment to create more feminine features on her eyebrows, eye line and lips. She underwent the two-hour semi-permanent make-up treatment to create more feminine features on her eyebrows, eye line and lips. The two-hour appointment included an eyebrow treatment, which claims to add a more feminine defined arch, a treatment to accentuate and widen her eyes, and a lip treatment, which promises to re-shape and boost the natural lip colour. During the treatment Kellie said: 'If I hadn’t come-out as a woman, I wouldn’t be laying here on a beauty clinic treatment bed, I would be laying on a slab in an undertakers. That was the choice I had, it was either let it beat me and have the depression kill me or come out and embrace the world.' 'On my way to the clinic today, some girls stopped me and said they really admired what I was doing and how brave I was. But I don’t put it down to bravery, I put it down to being a necessity of what I had to do.' Glamorous: Kellie, 61, is now undergoing a raft of cosmetic treatments to become a woman before her final sex change operation in January. Spot the difference: The two-hour appointment included an eyebrow treatment which added a more feminine defined arch, a treatment to accentuate and widen her eyes, and a lip treatment, which re-shaped and boosted the natural lip colour (left, after, right, before) Kellie admitted that the semi-permanent make-up treatment was going to be a great help for her because she isn't yet an expert at doing her own make-up. And she added: 'I find it really hard to do eyeliner, I smudge it every time, and this will help me so that when I get up out of bed in the morning I don’t have to spend so much time doing my make-up, and I’ve always wanted my eyebrows to have a more feminine arch and look more natural - and hopefully a bit more beautiful. 'When I was Frank I tried to keep my eyebrows quite fine, and I always wanted to have arches. I was quite vain as Frank but now I’m even vainer as Kelly.' Process: Kellie admitted that the semi-permanent make-up treatment was going to be a great help for her because she isn't yet an expert at doing her own make-up. In action: Since coming out as a woman this August, Kellie, pictured being treated by Debra, said she has looked to female role models like Lorraine Kelly, Charlotte Hawkins and Suzannah Reid to model herself and her new look on. To prepare for the treatment Kellie had her eyebrows and lips covered with an anesthetic cream for 20 minutes, then the shape and size of the eyebrows were carefully measured and the outline of the new shape was created with an eyebrow pencil. When Kellie was happy with the shape, Debra started the treatment with a pen device which holds ultra-fine needles. Debra matched the chosen pigments to the natural colour of Kellie’s eyebrows, and with precisely simulated hair strokes, create a defined lift to the arch of the brow - Kellie said this would be similar to that of daughters Sophie, 19 and Libby, 13. Since coming out as a woman this August, Kellie said she has looked to female role models like Lorraine Kelly, Charlotte Hawkins and Suzannah Reid to model herself and her new look on, but she admitted during the treatment that the most important influence on her is from female members of her close family. Helping hand: With the new semi-permanent make-up, Kellie admitted most people don't think she looks like a man anymore. Kellie said: 'To be honest, my three daughters are my role models and they help me! Also my mum has been totally unbelievable since she was told about 15 months ago. Power Brow from £760. Eye Intensifier (top and bottom lid) £1,000. Kiss Proof Lip treatment £1,270. Total: £3,030. 'My two eldest ones, who are quite big now, don’t call me dad, but my 13-year-old she still does. I still get a few funny looks but as people recognise me as Kellie now so they don’t pay me as much attention.' And she added: 'My mother tells me not to wear heavy make-up every day, she tells me I must let my skin breathe. My mother hardly wears much make-up - a little bit of lipstick and bit of powder, and she’d just wear a bit of Nivea cream and she still uses it today, she’s 81 and she’s got beautiful skin. She looks like she’s in her 60s. We are very close now and she’s very protective of me and she sits and shows me pictures of her when she was younger and she’s stunning. 'When I look at my daughters and I think what fun they have, and how they look, I think I will never experience that, but the experience I have now is like starting all over again. 'My three daughters are very helpful for me getting my style right and I sit and watch the TV presenters, and shows like Sex and The City and Friends and I would model myself on them. 'I would walk along and watch women walking along the street and how they dress. When I first came out, I would never wear jeans. I wanted to look natural but unfortunately I’m very recognisable.' Selfie: Kellie captures a quick snap with Debra mid-way through her treatment. But with the new semi-permanent make-up, Kellie admitted most people don’t think she looks like a man anymore. Kellie added: 'I wonder what my colleagues would think now if they can see the semi-permanent make-up treatment that I’ve had? I’ve heard a few stories from people in the boxing world who think it’s all one of Frank Maloney big stunts and that I’ve fooled you all and I want to stay as Frank. 'But I think to myself they have got to be crazy, no human being would put themselves through some of the treatment that I’ve been having - the hormones, the electrolysis, the operations - this semi-permanent treatment is fine, but the other stuff isn’t nice. 'And I’m going to have surgery in Belgium in November on my nose because my nostrils are too big and they are going to lift the eyes and then on January 13th I’m going to have my operation and breasts done. 'But I’m so pleased with the semi-permanent make-up I’ve had, my face looks so much more feminine now. I’ll definitely come back to have a top up a couple of times a year.' Next step: Kellie is going to have surgery in Belgium in November on her nose because she says her nostrils are too big.

The main topic of the premise is the difference between something being comic and something being cute when it's made small. Step 2: Identify the subjects and their descriptions. There are two main subjects in the premise: 1. A big thing made tiny is not comic, but rather it's cute. Examples are provided: a dollhouse, a teddy bear, and a tiny Boris Yeltsin. 2. Boris Yeltsin is mentioned as potentially being able to ride to the Duma on the back of a mouse if he's not too drunk. Step 3: Analyze what the premise is trying to say about the subjects. The premise appears to be using Boris Yeltsin's possible intoxication as an interesting detail or exaggeration, but the main focus is still on the difference between something being comic and something being cute. The mention of Boris Yeltsin having a drinking problem seems to be secondary to the main message of the premise. Step 4: Evaluate whether the information about the subject (Boris Yeltsin) found in the premise can lead to the truth of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is \\"Boris Yeltsin, unfortunately, had a bit of a drinking problem.\\" The premise states that tiny Boris Yeltsin might not be able to ride to the Duma on the back of a mouse if he's too drunk. The mention of drunkenness is not definitive proof of a drinking problem, but it does imply that Boris Yeltsin might have been known for his alcohol consumption. Step 5: Justify the conclusion. Based on the analysis in Steps 1-4, the hypothesis cannot be deemed unequivocally true. However, it can be considered somewhat likely, given the mention of Boris Yeltsin's drunkenness in the premise. It's important to note that the premise is not a direct statement of fact about Boris Yeltsin's drinking problem, but rather it alludes to the possibility of his alcohol consumption being an issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question. Which British battleship was sunk by a German U-boat in Scapa Flow in October 1939?","completion":"The British battleship that was sunk by a German U-boat in Scapa Flow in October 1939 was the HMS Royal Oak. The Royal Oak was a Revenge-class battleship, built by the Royal Navy in the early 20th century. She was commissioned relatively late in WWI, in May 1916, and thus saw little action during that conflict. HMS Royal Oak was, however, present during the Battle of Jutland as part of the 4th Battleship Squadron. During the interwar years, the Royal Oak underwent modernization and upgrades and was active in the Mediterranean Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet. By the time it was attacked by the German U-boat, the ship was considered somewhat outdated but was still part of the Royal Navy's Home Fleet, tasked with defending Britain's territorial waters. The incident took place in Scapa Flow, which is a body of water located in the Orkney Islands to the north of mainland Scotland. This waterway served as a strategically significant base during both World Wars due to its location and well-protected natural harbors, providing security for British naval ships. On 14 October 1939, just over a month after the start of World War II, the German submarine U-47, commanded by Lieutenant Günther Prien, infiltrated the formidable defenses of Scapa Flow. Prien accomplished this feat by navigating around the underwater blockships and through the infamous Kirk Sound, despite its strong currents and shallow waters. Once inside the Flow, Prien sighted the HMS Royal Oak, which he at first mistook for a more recent battleship design. Nevertheless, around 12:58 AM on October 14, U-47 launched a salvo of three torpedoes at the Royal Oak, only one of which struck the ship. The damage was not significant, and the crew believed the explosion to be the result of an internal accident, rather than an enemy attack. However, Prien was not deterred by the initial failure and repositioned his U-boat for a second attack. Around 1:16 AM, U-47 fired a second salvo of three torpedoes, with two striking the doomed battleship. This time, the devastation was massive, and the Royal Oak quickly capsized and sank, taking the lives of 833 of her crew, many of whom were trapped inside as she turned over. Only around 386 crew members managed to survive the ordeal. The sinking of the HMS Royal Oak by U-47 was a significant propaganda victory for the Germans in the early stages of the war. The British, shocked by the event, initiated a massive effort to improve Scapa Flow's defenses. The attack brought attention to the vulnerability of established naval bases, which spurred the development of new tactics and strategies to protect the fleets. In summary, the British battleship HMS Royal Oak, a Revenge-class vessel, was sunk by the German U-boat U-47 in Scapa Flow on October 14, 1939, during World War II. This daring attack demonstrated the effectiveness of submarine warfare and had far-reaching consequences for naval warfare tactics and strategies."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Context: Sydney would always spend a lot of time with her friends and family.

He is thought by U.S. military analysts to have commanded up to 5,000 fighters and to have been behind numerous attacks in Pakistan including the assassination of Benazir Bhutto which he and others have denied. Disagreement exists over the exact date of the militant's death. On 28 December 2007 the Pakistan government claimed that it had strong evidence regarding Baitullah Mehsud as the man behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on 27 December 2007. The Pakistani government released a transcript it asserted was from a conversation between Baitullah Mehsud and Maulvi Sahib (literally \\"Mr. Cleric\\"). According to the transcript Maulvi Sahib claimed credit for the attack, Baitullah Mehsud asked who carried it out, and was told, \\"There were Saeed, the second was Badarwala Bilal and Ikramullah was also there.\\" The translation released from Agence France Presse differed slightly from the translation from the Associated Press. According to the transcripts Baitullah Mehsud says he is at, \\"Anwar Shah's house\\", in Makeen or Makin. The Agence France Presse transcript identifies Makeen as a town in South Waziristan. Subsequently, both Agence France Presse and NDTV released an official denial by Mehsud's spokesman in which he said that Mehsud had no involvement in the attack, that the transcript was \\"a drama\\", that it would have been \\"impossible\\" for militants to penetrate the security cordon around Bhutto, and that her death was a \\"tragedy\\" which had left Mehsud \\"shocked\\". Mehsud's spokesman was quoted as saying: \\"I strongly deny it. Tribal people have their own customs. We don't strike women.\\" In an address to the nation on 2 January 2008, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said that he believed Maulana Fazlullah and Baitullah Mehsud were prime suspects in the assassination of Bhutto. On 18 January 2008, The Washington Post reported that the CIA has concluded that Mehsud was behind the Bhutto assassination. \\"Offering the most definitive public assessment by a U.S. intelligence official, Michael V. Hayden said Bhutto was killed by fighters allied with Mehsud, a tribal leader in northwestern Pakistan, with support from al-Qaeda's terrorist network.\\" U.S. President George W. Bush then placed Mr. Mehsud on \\"a classified list of militant leaders whom the C.I.A. and American commandos were authorized to capture or kill.\\" Why was he classified as a militant leader","completion":"Baitullah Mehsud was classified as a militant leader due to several factors, including his role in founding and leading the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), his involvement in numerous attacks in Pakistan, his alliance with other militant groups, and his suspected link to Al-Qaeda's terrorist network. Let's delve deeper into each of these reasons: 1. Founding and leading the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP): Mehsud is credited with forming the TTP in December 2007, bringing together about five militant groups to create a powerful and well-organized force. The TTP has been responsible for countless acts of terrorism, suicide bombings, and other assaults both within and outside Pakistan. 2. Orchestrating numerous attacks in Pakistan: As the leader of the TTP, Mehsud was thought to command up to 5,000 fighters and is believed to have been behind numerous deadly and high-profile attacks in Pakistan. This includes the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, although he and others have denied the involvement in her killing. 3. Alliance with other militant groups: Mehsud's organization had close ties with other regional and global militant groups, such as the Afghan Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and the Haqqani Network. These alliances further solidified his position as a dangerous militant leader and allowed for greater access to funding, weaponry, training, and operational capabilities. 4. Suspected link to Al-Qaeda: Due to his connections with other militant groups like Al-Qaeda, he attracted the attention of the U.S. intelligence community. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) concluded that Mehsud was behind the Bhutto assassination, which led to the U.S. President George W. Bush authorizing the CIA and American commandos to capture or kill him. This further demonstrated the threat Mehsud posed as a militant leader and his impact on global security. These factors, along with his influence over the tribal regions of Pakistan, the attacks carried out under his command, and his defiance against the Pakistani government, all contributed to his classification as a militant leader. Due to his status and role in perpetuating violence and terrorism in Pakistan and the broader region, Mehsud became a high-priority target for both the Pakistani government and the U.S. military forces."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Dialogue: W: Have you ever put a computer together before?

What should you use to make the base of the paws for your werewolf costume?","completion":"To make the base of the paws for a werewolf costume, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Gather materials: To create the base of the paws, you will need materials such as foam, fabric (preferably faux fur), scissors, a hot glue gun, and a suitable footwear to serve as the base (e.g., an old pair of shoes or slippers). 2. Determine the shape: First, decide the shape of the werewolf paws you'd like to create. Werewolf paws typically have elongated paw pads and sharp claws. Sketch or find a reference image that you'd like to mimic, considering factors like the size and shape of the paw pads and claws. 3. Create a pattern: Using either tracing paper or newspaper, create a pattern that matches the outline of the paw you want, sized according to the footwear you're using as the base. This pattern will help give your werewolf paws a consistent shape. 4. Cut out the foam: Lay out the foam and use your pattern to trace the outline of the paw onto the foam. Cut out the foam shapes using scissors or a utility knife. 5. Shape the foam: To better mimic the shape of a werewolf's paw, you may need to carve and shape the foam. This step might involve rounding the edges, adding dimension to the paw pads, or adding texture to the foam to emulate fur patterns. 6. Attach the foam to the base: Use a hot glue gun to attach the foam pieces to the top of your chosen footwear. Keep in mind the position of the paw pads so they sit in a natural orientation for a werewolf paw. 7. Cut out the fabric: Using your pattern as a guide, cut out the faux fur fabric, making sure the fur direction matches the natural flow of fur on a werewolf's paw. 8. Attach the fabric: Carefully align the fur fabric with the foam paws and use the hot glue gun to secure it in place. Be sure to press the fabric into the glue so it adheres well. 9. Add claws: Once the fabric is securely fastened, create claws using either craft foam, plastic, or any other suitable material. Paint them with a natural or desired claw color, then attach them to the paw using hot glue. 10. Finishing touches: Examine your completed werewolf paws to ensure that all pieces are securely attached and properly aligned. Trim any excess fabric or foam and add additional layers of fur if necessary to create a realistic appearance. By following these steps, you can create a realistic base for the paws of your werewolf costume."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the below conversation. M: Hello? W: Hello.

While investing in a new piece of furniture can indeed transform the atmosphere of a room, the expenses can sometimes be overwhelming. However, there's an alternative option that can save you a considerable amount of money while simultaneously revamping your interior: painting your couch! You might wonder, is it possible? Can your old couch look as good as new with a simple coat of paint? The answer is a resounding yes! In this article, we will guide you through the process of painting your couch to give it a brand-new look, step by step. 1. Prepare the Couch: Before you start painting, it is essential to prepare the couch to ensure a clean and smooth application of paint. Here's how you can do it: a) Cleaning: First things first, make sure your couch is thoroughly cleaned. Vacuum away any dirt, debris, and pet hair from your sofa, paying special attention to corners, seams, and crevices. b) Disassembly: If possible, remove the cushions from your sofa. This will allow for a more efficient painting process and give you easier access to the nooks and crannies of your couch. Remember to label the removable parts for easy reassembly later on. c) Cover the Area: To prevent any paint spills or splatters, cover the area around the couch with drop cloths or plastic sheeting. This will protect your flooring and minimize the clean-up process once you've completed your project. 2. Choose the Right Paint: Using the correct type of paint is crucial for the success of your project. You will need a fabric or upholstery paint which is specifically designed for painting furniture. These paints are flexible, allow the fabric to breathe and are available in numerous colors and finishes. Brands such as Simply Spray and Tulip offer a wide selection of fabric-safe options. Make sure to read the paint's instructions and follow any recommendations regarding possible priming, pre-treatment, or post-treatment of your couch's fabric. 3. Apply the Paint: Armed with the right paint, it's time to bring new life to your couch. Follow these steps for smooth application: a) Test: Before committing to painting your entire couch, perform a patch test on a small inconspicuous area. This will allow you to see how the paint interacts with your couch's fabric and identify any potential issues. b) Mask Off: Use painter's tape to mask off any areas you want to protect from paint, such as trim, legs, or decorative elements. c) Method: Each type of paint has its recommended method of application, from spraying to brushing. Choose a technique that fits the type of paint you've chosen, and ensure even coverage throughout the piece. d) Apply Multiple Coats: Apply thin and even coats of paint to your couch, allowing it to dry completely between coats. This helps to create a smooth and uniform appearance. 4. Let it Dry Between Coats: Take some time to allow the paint to dry between each coat fully. Drying times will vary, depending on the type of paint and the fabric of your couch. Check the manufacturer's recommendations and be prepared to wait anywhere between two hours to overnight for the paint to dry. Don't rush the process – letting the paint dry between coats is essential for the success of your project. 5. Wipe Off Excess Paint and Reassemble: Once the paint is dry, you might notice some small paint specks or uneven coverage. Use a lint-free cloth to gently wipe off any excess paint, ensuring a clean and professional finish. Lastly, reassemble your couch, including reattaching any cushions or decorative elements you may have removed. Conclusion: With a bit of effort, patience, and the right tools, you can transform your old couch into an eye-catching, revitalized centerpiece to your living space. Painting your couch not only saves you money but allows you to unleash your creativity and make a truly unique statement. So, go ahead - grab your fabric paint and start breathing new life into your couch today!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Freeman Lowell, one of four crewmen aboard, is the resident botanist and ecologist who carefully preserves a variety of plants for their eventual return to Earth and the reforestation of the planet. Lowell spends most of his time in the domes, both cultivating the crops and attending to the animal life. The crew receives orders to jettison and destroy the domes (with nuclear charges) and return the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six domes are jettisoned and blown up Lowell rebels and opts instead to save the plants and animals on his ship. Lowell kills one of his crew-mates who arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the destruction of one of the remaining domes, trapping and killing the remaining two crewmen.

The first successful use of poison gas as a weapon of warfare occurred during the Second Battle of Ypres . Gas was soon used by all major belligerents throughout the war. It is estimated that the use of chemical weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties. For example, the British had over 180,000 chemical weapons casualties during the war, and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in World War I. The use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use. The effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants. Civilians were at risk from the gases as winds blew the poison gases through their towns, and they rarely received warnings or alerts of potential danger. In addition to absent warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. An estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them. British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote in his diary, \\"My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront. However, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all.\\" Answer this question: Who had more chemical weapons casualties, the Russians or the British?","completion":"The Russians had more chemical weapons casualties than the British.

From 1848 until independence, the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria was administered as an integral part of France. The vast arid interior of Algeria, like the rest of French North Africa, was never considered part of France. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants, known as ' and later, as '. However, indigenous Muslims remained a majority of the territory's population throughout its history. Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population with its lack of political and economic status fueled calls for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began.

These beverages are typically served in a cup which has a handle designed for holding. After going to Starbucks, it is most common for people to be holding the handle of a coffee cup, as it contains the beverage they bought from the store. The other options provided do not fit the context as accurately: 1. Gripping: This is an action rather than an object, and it doesn't specify what the person is gripping or holding onto. 2. Briefcase: While someone might carry a briefcase due to work or business purposes, this is not a specific item related to Starbucks and purchasing beverages. 3. Carry object: This answer is too vague and doesn't refer to a specific item related to visiting Starbucks. 4. Frying pan: This is entirely unrelated to a Starbucks experience, as frying pans are used for cooking and not typically associated with purchasing beverages at coffee shops. Hence, \\"coffee cup\\" is the best choice among the provided options, as it directly pertains to the activity of going to Starbucks and obtaining a beverage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maffie also composed music, including the theme for \`House Party'.\\" The pronoun \\"him\\" implies that someone, possibly Maffie, is considered by Jesse Crawford as one of the greatest ballad organists. Then the sentence states that Maffie also composed music, including the theme for \\"House Party\\". In the second sentence, \\"Maffie considered him \`one of the greatest ballad organists', and Jesse Crawford also composed music, including the theme for \`House Party\`.\\" Here, the pronoun \\"him\\" suggests that someone other than Jesse Crawford and Maffie, is considered by Maffie to be one of the greatest ballad organists. It then states that Jesse Crawford also composed music, such as the theme for \\"House Party\\". Therefore, in the first sentence, Maffie could be the one Jesse Crawford is praising as an organist, and Jesse Crawford and Maffie are composers. But in the second sentence, Maffie is praising an unspecified organist, and only Jesse Crawford is clearly stated to be a composer.

South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was “internally carrying out preparations” to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement. North Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country’s external trade. Seeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. But easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North’s denuclearization promises. “Once the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,” said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program.

The following article contains an answer for the question: In what year did the song Symfonin reach top of the Swedish singles charts at the festival that has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts? , can you please find it? Hundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process in the formation of a tropical cyclone, which is initiated by the factors mentioned, can be described in the following manner: - As the cluster of thunderstorms continues to intensify around the area of low pressure and derive energy from the warm ocean waters, the storm's organization and circulation becomes more established and well-defined. - The Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect) influences the weather system and imparts a spin to the storm, eventually leading to the formation of a cyclonic pattern, characterized by a tight, closed circulation with strong winds. - The strong winds create a balancing act between the inward pressure gradient force (the force that pushes air towards the center of the storm) and the outward Coriolis force (the force that deflects air away from the center due to the Earth's rotation). This balance is known as gradient wind balance. - As the wind speed increases, the storm's organization improves, with the development of a central area of low pressure known as the \\"eye\\" and a ring of intense thunderstorms surrounding it, called the \\"eyewall.\\" The air spirals inward towards the eye and rises rapidly within the eyewall, releasing heat through condensation processes. This heat release further reinforces the storm's intensity and structure. - When the sustained wind speeds in the storm reach a certain threshold (74 mph or 119 km/h), the system is considered a fully-formed tropical cyclone, commonly referred to as a hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone, depending on the region where it occurs. - Once the tropical cyclone is fully established, it continues to move following the prevailing atmospheric steering currents. It may eventually make landfall, bringing strong winds, heavy rains, and other associated hazards such as storm surges, flooding, and in some cases, even tornadoes. The storm will gradually weaken over the land since it no longer has access to the warm ocean waters that provide its primary energy source. Another possible scenario is the storm moving into cooler ocean waters, where it would also lose its energy supply and weaken. In conclusion, the last step of the process involves the full evolution and organization of the storm into a mature tropical cyclone, with a well-defined circulation, intensely powerful winds, and a potentially destructive impact on any landmass in its path."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The continuation northwest passed Verulamium (St Albans) on its way to Viroconium (Wroxeter). The Romans considered the continuation on to Blatobulgium (Birrens) beyond Hadrian's Wall to be part of the same route, leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well, although others restrict it to the southern leg. Watling Street was the site of Boudica's defeat by the Romans and the southwestern border of the Danelaw.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Gangrene (or gangrenous necrosis) is a type of necrosis caused by a critically insufficient blood supply. This potentially life-threatening condition may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. The primary cause of gangrene is reduced blood supply to the affected tissues, which results in cell death. Diabetes and long-term smoking increase the risk of suffering from gangrene. - Bleeding, also known as hemorrhaging or haemorrhaging, is blood escaping from the circulatory system. Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from blood vessels inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina or anus, or through a break in the skin. Hypovolemia is a massive decrease in blood volume, and death by excessive loss of blood is referred to as exsanguination. Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 1015% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison, blood donation typically takes 810% of the donor's blood volume). The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called hemostasis and is an important part of both first aid and surgery. - Rheumatoid vasculitis is skin condition that is a typical feature of rheumatoid arthritis , presenting as peripheral vascular lesions that are localized purpura , cutaneous ulceration , and gangrene of the distal parts of the extremities . - Purpura is a condition of red or purple discolored spots on the skin that do not blanch on applying pressure. The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin usually secondary to vasculitis or dietary deficiency of vitamin C (scurvy). They measure 0.31 cm (310 mm), whereas petechiae measure less than 3 mm, and ecchymoses greater than 1 cm. - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear... - Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C. Early symptoms include weakness, feeling tired, curly hair, and sore arms and legs. Without treatment, decreased red blood cells, gum disease, and bleeding from the skin may occur. As scurvy worsens there can be poor wound healing, personality changes, and finally death from infection or bleeding. Scurvy is caused by not enough vitamin C in the diet. It typically takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C before symptoms occur. In modern times, it occurs most commonly in people with mental disorders, unusual eating habits, alcoholism, and old people who live alone. Other risk factors include intestinal malabsorption and dialysis. Humans and certain other animals require vitamin C in their diets to make the building blocks for collagen. Diagnosis is typically based on physical signs, X-rays, and improvement after treatment. Treatment is with vitamin C supplements taken by mouth. Improvement often begins in a few days with complete recovery in a few weeks. Sources of vitamin C in the diet include citrus fruit and a number of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes. Cooking often decreases vitamin C in foods. Scurvy is currently rare. It occurs more often in the developing world in association with malnutrition. Rates among refugees are reported at 5% to 45%. Scurvy was described as early as the time of ancient Egypt. It was a limiting factor in long distance sea travel, often killing large numbers of people. A Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind, was the first to prove it could be treated with citrus fruit in a 1753 publication. His experiments represented the first controlled trial. It took another 40 years before the British Navy began giving out lemon juice routinely. - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed... - Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce.

Two males in period costume are having a conversation: This premise describes a scene where we have two males dressed in attire appropriate for a specific historical era, engaged in a conversation. The words \\"period costume\\" indicate that the clothing they wear represents a certain time in history. 2. Two men are acting in a period play: This statement provides us with an apparent context where our two males are involved. They are actors participating in a theatrical production that takes place in a particular historical era. The term \\"period play\\" gives us the detail about the setting and implies that their attire and dialogues would correspond to that era. Now let's connect these two statements: A period play would most likely have characters dressed in costumes representative of the time it is set in. Furthermore, it is quite natural for the characters in a play to engage in conversations as part of their performance. Therefore, given these pieces of information, we can deduce that the initial premise of \\"Two males in period costume are having a conversation\\" is true.

Here's a step-by-step justification for this conclusion. Step 1: Extract the key sentiment of each review The initial step in assessing the overall consensus is to extract the sentiment from each of the individual reviews. 1. Positive: The reviewer enjoyed the movie and praised its consistency. 2. Mixed: The reviewer found it entertaining but also unrealistic. 3. Positive: The reviewer appreciates the performance of the actors and the tactful exaggeration of action scenes. 4. Positive: The reviewer enjoyed the balance between comedy and seriousness in this action thriller. 5. Neutral: The reviewer is trying to identify the target audience of the movie. 6. Negative: The reviewer feels that the movie is going nowhere despite its charm and goodwill. 7. Neutral: The reviewer asks a rhetorical question, likely wondering if it can boost the summer movie season. 8. Positive: The reviewer seems to enjoy the characteristic action style of Tom Cruise. 9. Mixed: The reviewer found the movie to be staggering in terms of structure and felt the full potential was not met. 10. Positive: Even with plenty of high effects, the reviewer appreciated the humorous approach. Step 2: Weight the sentiments The next step is to weigh the sentiments to give a more detailed outlook. Out of ten reviews, there are 5 positive, 2 mixed, 1 negative, 2 neutral. Step 3: Determine the general consensus The overall consensus is leaning more towards positive as the majority of reviews are positive, even though there exist some mixed and negative reviews. So, the movie \\"Knight and Day\\" is generally well-received by the audience as suggested by the positive reviews. Those who gave mixed or negative reviews cited confusion about the audience demographic, unfulfilled potential and a sense of the plot \\"going nowhere\\" despite good performances.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Khan's central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the idea of the \\"tube\\" structural system for tall buildings, including the framed tube, trussed tube, and bundled tube variants. His \\"tube concept\\", using all the exterior wall perimeter structure of a building to simulate a thin-walled tube, revolutionized tall building design. Most buildings over 40 stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles. Lateral loads (horizontal forces) such as wind forces, seismic forces, etc., begin to dominate the structural system and take on increasing importance in the overall building system as the building height increases. Wind forces become very substantial, and forces caused by earthquakes, etc. are important as well. The tubular designs resist such forces for tall buildings. Tube structures are stiff and have significant advantages over other framing systems. They not only make the buildings structurally stronger and more efficient, but also significantly reduce the structural material requirements. The reduction of material makes the buildings economically more efficient and reduces environmental impact. The tubular designs enable buildings to reach even greater heights. Tubular systems allow greater interior space and further enable buildings to take on various shapes, offering added freedom to architects. These new designs opened an economic door for contractors, engineers, architects, and investors, providing vast amounts of real estate space on minimal plots of land. Khan was among a group of engineers who encouraged a rebirth in skyscraper construction after a hiatus of over thirty years. The tubular systems have yet to reach their limit when it comes to height. Another important feature of the tubular systems is that buildings can be constructed using steel or reinforced concrete, or a composite of the two, to reach greater heights. Khan pioneered the use of lightweight concrete for high-rise buildings, at a time when reinforced concrete was used for mostly low-rise construction of only a few stories in height. Most of Khan's designs were conceived considering pre-fabrication and repetition of components so projects could be quickly built with minimal errors. The population explosion, starting with the baby boom of the 1950s, created widespread concern about the amount of available living space, which Khan solved by building upward. More than any other 20th-century engineer, Fazlur Rahman Khan made it possible for people to live and work in \\"cities in the sky.\\" Mark Sarkisian (Director of Structural and Seismic Engineering at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill) said, \\"Khan was a visionary who transformed skyscrapers into sky cities while staying firmly grounded in the fundamentals of engineering.\\" Answer this question \\"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects about this article.

Why or why not? Question 2: Does Donald Trump have any potential to be a good president? Choose your answer from: (a). no; (b). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer the first question, whether Donald Trump would make a good U.S. president, it's essential to consider several factors: 1. Background: Trump has experience in the business world, which can be beneficial for economic and fiscal decision-making. However, he lacks experience in the political sphere, which may hinder his ability to navigate complex political issues. 2. Policies: Analyzing Trump's policy preferences helps us evaluate the potential consequences of his decisions. For example, he has been a strong advocate for deregulation and tax cuts, which some argue can spur economic growth but others claim can exacerbate income inequality. 3. Communication: Trump's communication style can be polarizing; some appreciate his blunt, straightforward approach, while others criticize it as divisive and unhelpful for diplomatic relations. Considering these factors, one's evaluation of whether Trump would make a good U.S. president depends on personal beliefs and values. For the second question, it's necessary to look at a few key aspects: 1. Adaptability: While Trump may have demonstrated some strong convictions in his tenure, considering whether he could grow into the role of a good president requires evaluating his potential for adaptability and learning from experience. 2. Leadership qualities: Some believe Trump possesses strong leadership qualities, such as decisiveness, while others argue that he struggles to build consensus and unite people. So, the answer to question 2 would be: (b) yes, he has the potential to be a good president, but it depends on personal beliefs, values, and the importance placed on adaptability and leadership qualities. To conclude, the answer to the first and second questions likely will not be the same for everyone. Question 1 requires a more comprehensive evaluation of Trump's qualifications and actions, while question 2 focuses on his potential for growth and leadership. Different individuals will weigh these factors differently, resulting in different conclusions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 1: What would the sky look like if Andromeda was colliding with the Milky Way right now? Question 2: What will the sky look like when the Milky Way collides with Andromeda? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Task 1: Answer what the sky would look like in case Andromeda was colliding with the Milky Way right now. The answer for the first question depends on the specific stage of the collision. If Andromeda was in the early stages of approaching the Milky Way, to us observers on Earth, Andromeda would appear larger and brighter in the night sky. As the collision progressed, gravitational forces between the two galaxies would distort their shapes, causing extreme celestial chaos. There would be a dramatic increase in new star formation, and massive amounts of dust and gas clouds. We'd see brilliant, vivid nebulae across the sky. However, it's important to remember that this process would take billions of years - human beings would likely be long extinct before the really dramatic scenes took place. Task 2: Answer what the sky will look like when the Milky Way collides with Andromeda. The future collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda is predicted to begin approximately 4 billion years from now, and then take about another 2 billion years to complete. Initially, the sky would be hugely altered as Andromeda, currently a faint smudge, starts getting closer and becoming brighter. During the collision, the night sky would be filled with vast clouds of stars, gas, and dust, and cosmic fireworks caused by massive bursts of star formation. At the peak of the collision, the sight would be extraordinarily chaotic and beautiful. Thereafter, the view would depend heavily on Earth's position within the resultant galaxy, post collision. Task 3: Compare the answers for these two questions. The outcomes of these two questions are indeed similar, given that both prompt essentially the same event - Andromeda's collision with the Milky Way. The main factor that differentiates the two questions is the timing - whether the collision is happening now, or in the future. In both cases, how the sky looks depends on when you're observing it in relation to the collision event which would last over billions of years. The process is a slow, cosmic ballet which would dramatically reshape our night sky over a very long timescale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a news article: Public Health To Protect His Son, A Father Asks School To Bar Unvaccinated Children i itoggle caption Courtesy of Carl Krawitt Courtesy of Carl Krawitt Carl Krawitt has watched his son, Rhett, now 6, fight leukemia for the past 4 1/2 years. For more than three of those years, Rhett has undergone round after round of chemotherapy. Last year he finished chemotherapy, and doctors say he is in remission. Now, there's a new threat, one that the family should not have to worry about: measles. Rhett cannot be vaccinated, because his immune system is still rebuilding. It may be months more before his body is healthy enough to get all his immunizations. Until then, he depends on everyone around him for protection — what's known as herd immunity. But Rhett lives in Marin County, Calif., a county with the dubious honor of having the highest rate of \\"personal belief exemptions\\" in the Bay Area and among the highest in the state. This school year, 6.45 percent of children in Marin have a personal belief exemption, which allows parents to lawfully send their children to school unvaccinated against communicable diseases like measles, polio, whooping cough and more. Carl Krawitt has had just about enough. \\"It's very emotional for me,\\" he said. \\"If you choose not to immunize your own child and your own child dies because they get measles, OK, that's your responsibility, that's your choice. But if your child gets sick and gets my child sick and my child dies, then ... your action has harmed my child.\\" Krawitt is taking action of his own. His son attends Reed Elementary in Tiburon, a school with a 7 percent personal belief exemption rate. (The statewide average is 2.5 percent). Krawitt had previously worked with the school nurse to make sure that all the children in his son's class were fully vaccinated. He said the school was very helpful and accommodating. Now Krawitt and his wife, Jodi, have emailed the district's superintendent, requesting that the district \\"require immunization as a condition of attendance, with the only exception being those who cannot medically be vaccinated.\\" Carl Krawitt provided me with Superintendent Steven Herzog's response. Herzog didn't directly address their query, instead saying: \\"We are monitoring the situation closely and will take whatever actions necessary to ensure the safety of our students.\\" Typically, a response to health emergencies rests with county health officers. During the current measles outbreak, we've already seen that unvaccinated students at Huntington Beach High School in Orange County were ordered to stay out of school for three weeks after a student there contracted measles. It's one way to contain an outbreak. But those steps were taken in the face of a confirmed case at the school. When I called Marin County health officer Matt Willis to see what he thought of keeping unvaccinated kids out of school even if there were no confirmed cases, he sounded intrigued. \\"This is partly a legal question,\\" he said. But he was open to the idea and said he was going to check with the state to see what precedent there was to take such an action. Right now, there are no cases of measles anywhere in Marin and no suspected cases either. Still, \\"if the outbreak progresses and we start seeing more and more cases,\\" Willis said, \\"then this is a step we might want to consider\\" — requiring unvaccinated children to stay home, even without confirmed cases at a specific school. Rhett has been treated at the University of California, San Francisco, and his oncologist there, Dr. Robert Goldsby, said that he is likely at higher risk of complications if he were to get measles. i itoggle caption Courtesy of Carl Krawitt Courtesy of Carl Krawitt \\"When your immune system isn't working as well, it allows many different infections to be worse,\\" Goldsby said. \\"It's not just Rhett. There are hundreds of other kids in the Bay Area that are going through cancer therapy, and it's not fair to them. They can't get immunized; they have to rely on their friends and colleagues and community to help protect them.\\" Goldsby pointed to the number of people who, when facing a friend or family member who receives a challenging diagnosis, will immediately ask how they can help. \\"Many families will say, 'What can I do to help? What can I do to help?' \\" he said, repeating it for emphasis. \\"One of the main things they can do is make sure their [own] kids are vaccinated to protect others.\\" Krawitt has been speaking up about vaccination for a long time now. He told me about going to a parent meeting at his daughter's school just before the start of the school year, where a staff member reminded parents not to send peanut products to school, since a child or children had an allergy. \\"It's really important your kids don't bring peanuts, because kids can die,\\" Krawitt recalls the group being told. The irony was not lost on him. He told me he immediately responded, \\"In the interest of the health and safety of our children, can we have the assurance that all the kids at our school are immunized?\\" He found out later from a friend that other parents who were present were \\"mad that you asked the question, because they don't immunize their kids.\\" This story was produced by State of Health, KQED's health blog. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Rhett, a 6-year-old boy, has been fighting leukemia for the past 4 and a half years and has recently gone into remission. However, due to his weakened immune system while it rebuilds, Rhett cannot be vaccinated yet and relies on herd immunity for protection against diseases such as measles. The family lives in Marin County, California, which has one of the highest rates of personal belief exemptions for vaccinations. As a result, Carl Krawitt is concerned about the potential risk unvaccinated children pose to his son. He has emailed the district's superintendent, requesting that the district require immunization as a condition of attendance, with exceptions only for those who cannot medically be vaccinated. The school and county health officials are monitoring the situation closely but have not yet implemented any changes. The article emphasizes the importance of vaccinations for not only individual children but also the community as a whole. Herd immunity helps protect vulnerable individuals, such as Rhett and other children with compromised immune systems, from potentially life-threatening diseases.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If the plates on Earth's crust were to move more quickly past each other, it could potentially affect the occurrence of less or weaker earthquakes in several ways. The supposed perturbation could have both direct and indirect effects on the process. 1. Direct effect: Faster movement of the plates might result in a more frequent release of stress, leading to a higher number of earthquakes. However, as the stress would be released more often, it is possible that the energy released during these events would be lower, resulting in less powerful or weaker earthquakes. 2. Indirect effect: Faster movement of the plates could also lead to more frequent interactions between them, which might change the dynamics of the tectonic system. This could result in a redistribution of stress, potentially affecting the occurrence of less or weaker earthquakes in certain areas. Ultimately, the perturbation of plates moving more quickly past each other could cause changes in the frequency, magnitude, and distribution of less or weaker earthquakes. However, predicting the exact outcomes would require a more detailed understanding of the specific interactions between the Earth's various tectonic plates and the geodynamic processes involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sir Nicholas Winton, rescuer of children, died on July 1st,2015,aged 106. When the letters and the honor came knocking on the door of his house in Maidenhead, and the filmmakers came calling, Nicholas Winton always protested that he was no hero. Heroes faced danger; he never had. They put their lives on the line; he had just worked at home in Hampstead, after a day being a stockbroker in the City. They avoided bullets and the secret police; he wrote letters, made telephone calls,and composed lists. The fact that he had rescued 669 children from Czechoslovakia just as the Nazis invaded did not, in his mind, constitute heroism. He hadn't gone out there in 1938 with any burning urge to do good; just for a holiday, in fact. Nor had he gone looking for children to rescue. Instead they and their parents had come to him, as soon as word got round that he might be able to help them leave Prague and get to the West. From 6.00 a.m. the knocks would come at the door of his room in the Europa Hotel, and he would open it to find some shivering, starving, desperate figure. When faced with a problem, his instinct was to solve it. So he made lists of the children, took their photographs, got them Home Office entry permits, found them foster families and organised their departure on trains, via the Netherlands, to Liverpool Street. After just three weeks in Prague, he went back to Britain and carried on the work from there. The British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia gave him almost no help, so he took sole charge himself. The Home Office was slow with entry permits, so he copied some illegally. In search of foster-parents for the children he put their photos in Picture Post; in the hope of farther havens for them he wrote to governors and senators in America and even to President Roosevelt, to no avail. He could have rescued at least 2,000 more, he said later, if America had been willing to take any. A hero might have got involved in the stress and distress of individual cases.

In 1999, Libya began secret talks with the British government to normalise relations. In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the U.S. improved as a result, while UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. The following month, Gaddafi travelled to the headquarters of the European Union (EU) in Brussels, signifying improved relations between Libya and the EU, the latter ending its remaining sanctions in October. In October 2010, the EU paid Libya €50 million to stop African migrants passing into Europe; Gaddafi encouraged the move, saying that it was necessary to prevent the loss of European cultural identity to a new \\"Black Europe\\". Removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2006, Gaddafi nevertheless continued his anti-western rhetoric, and at the Second Africa-South America Summit in Venezuela in September 2009, joined Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in calling for an \\"anti-imperialist\\" front across Africa and Latin America. Gaddafi proposed the establishment of a South Atlantic Treaty Organization to rival NATO. That month he also addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time, using it to condemn \\"western aggression\\". In Spring 2010, Gaddafi proclaimed jihad against Switzerland after Swiss police accused two of his family members of criminal activity in the country, resulting in the breakdown of bilateral relations.

They ultimately meet up with Dougie's sister Jenna and her new boyfriend Alex. Jenna promises to take Dougie--who is very naïve--out trick or treating. However, he becomes extremely jealous when her boyfriend Alex is invited along.On a walkabout to find Satan in the daylight of Halloween, a frustrated Dougie follows a masked figure as he sets up horror props on the front lawns of neighborhood houses. Unbeknownst to Dougie, the props are real corpses. Dougie is convinced this masked figure is Satan, proceeds to befriend him, and takes him back to his house to get rid of Alex. The silent Satan--who never speaks--eventually takes care of Alex, and fools the family into thinking he is Alex in a Halloween costume. Dougie believes that Satan is fun and friendly, and the family is convinced that the masked figure is Alex acting spookily.A killing spree starts around the neighborhood. Satan is welcomed into the family home; he acts playful or perversely when trying to avoid getting caught, which creates dark humor. Ultimately, Alex returns--we only thought he was killed--and the truth unfolds that this masked man is really some kind of serial killer. We then follow more killings, more close calls, and more wacky behavior at a huge Halloween party where Merrill has been taken, a taped-up hostage of the killer.In the end, the masked Satan character switches costumes twice to twist the plot a little, but he catches up with the surviving members of the family.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. Question: Who were those placed on stretchers? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"The individuals placed on stretchers during the 1980 Central Nyack bank robbery that unfolded at the Nyack Hospital were two police officers who were personally known to the staff, as well as the criminals involved in the robbery.

One of the officers was even the boyfriend of one of the nurses working at the hospital. The medical staff had to address serious, life-threatening wounds in a rapid manner, which included open heart massage and insertion of chest tubes. In addition to the traumatic injuries, the team also had to manage the emotionally charged atmosphere, as friends of the injured officers were attempting to confront the criminals who were also being treated. The event took a significant emotional toll on the medical staff, as it led to debriefing sessions for weeks and feelings of sadness and anger in the community for months.

Dean Smith's 1992-93 squad featured George Lynch, Eric Montross, Brian Reese, Donald Williams, and Derrick Phelps. The Tar Heels started out with an 8-0 record and were ranked #5 in the country when they met #6 Michigan in the semi-finals of the Rainbow Classic. The Wolverines, led by the Fab Five in their sophomore season, won 79-78 on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back road games against unranked Wake Forest and #5 Duke. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into the last week of the regular season (their first #1 ranking since the start of the 1987-88 season). North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77-75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps, who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, defeating #16-seed East Carolina (85-65), #8-seed Rhode Island (112-67), #4-seed Arkansas (80-74) and #2-seed Cincinnati (75-68) to reach the Final Four in New Orleans. In the National Semifinals, Smith's Tar Heels defeated his alma mater Kansas (coached by future North Carolina coach Roy Williams) 78-68. In 1991, the same two teams also met in the National Semifinals with Kansas prevailing and Dean Smith being ejected. The 1993 victory for UNC set up a rematch from earlier that season with #3-ranked Michigan in the Finals. The 1993 national title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber calling a time-out that Michigan didn't have with seconds left and Michigan trailing by only 2. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship due to an unforced error or intentional give-away by the opposing team.

Physiatry, or physical medicine and rehabilitation, specializes in addressing the functional aspects of pain and prescribing non-pharmacological therapies to alleviate discomfort and improve quality of life. Neurology focuses on the nervous system and can provide insights into the neurological mechanisms that contribute to pain, as well as offer targeted treatments for specific pain conditions related to the nervous system. Anesthesiology involves the management of acute and chronic pain through the use of various anesthetic and analgesic techniques, such as nerve blocks and spinal injections. Palliative medicine is dedicated to the relief of pain and other symptoms associated with serious illnesses, aiming to improve the overall well-being of patients with life-limiting conditions. Psychiatry, on the other hand, addresses the psychological and emotional aspects of pain, as well as helps patients develop coping strategies and build resilience to better manage their symptoms.

(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Paragraph: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L.

I would like to share an \\"outside the box\\" idea that I believe could positively impact our work environment. The idea I propose is a monthly team-building \\"Mystery Challenge.\\" Every month, employees would be divided into small groups and tasked with solving a mystery or completing a unique challenge created by a different department, promoting collaboration and creative problem-solving. These challenges could range from escape-room style activities to brainstorming sessions where employees invent new products or services for the company. To implement this initiative, we could designate one afternoon each month as the \\"Mystery Challenge Day.\\" The challenges can be designed by assigned department representatives, who would collaborate with HR to ensure the activities are inclusive and appropriate for the workplace. This initiative would require modest investments in resources while providing a unique and engaging opportunity for employees to connect. I believe this approach would have several benefits, including promoting camaraderie, fostering cross-departmental understanding, and stimulating creative thinking. Moreover, employees would have the opportunity to showcase their problem-solving skills in a fun and friendly environment, ultimately boosting morale. I would appreciate your thoughts and feedback on this idea. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask. I am open to exploring this further or adjusting the proposal as necessary. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, [Your Name]"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the story begins, seasoned Agent Martin Grey receives an anonymous tip hinting at Death Nell's next target: a high-ranking government official attending a prestigious international conference in New York CIty. The Agency assigns Martin and his new partner, the young and unproven Agent Hannah Banks, to locate and apprehend Death Nell before she strikes again.

Prestige Records released jazz records in this format in the late 1950s; for example, two of their Miles Davis albums were paired together in this format. Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the 33 1⁄3 rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2⁄3 rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the 16 2⁄3 rpm records. Subsequently, the 16 2⁄3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s. A:","completion":"Task Explanation: 1. Understand the given question. 2. Read and comprehend the context passage. 3. Answer the question based on the information in the passage.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight. and a hint : Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Please answer this question : Which group has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0? Answer:","completion":"Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0. This is because Group Yellow followed a normal diet, which means that they were possibly consuming an appropriate amount of calories to maintain their weight and energy needs. On the other hand, Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, leading them to gain a significant amount of weight. According to the hint given, consistently consuming more food energy than required can lead to obesity, which is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. By consuming a normal diet, Group Yellow would be less likely to develop obesity and thus have a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0 compared to Group Brown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As such, I’m going to be evicted.' Police from the NYPD's 10th precinct were eventually called to clear the apartment. Phoning the telephone number listed online, Gawker said they spoke to David who insisted he did nothing wrong, that there was no party and that Teman has said that he could have up to 50 guests to the apartment. Anger: When Ari realized what had occurred he instantly demanded an explanation from Airbnb. Prompt response: Airbnb have moved quickly to address Teman's issues with his apartment and their verification process.

Question: suppose less conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more scouring of rocks occurs. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's break down the process step-by-step and justify our answer: 1. Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere: These chemicals, primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are mainly released by burning fossil fuels. If less conservation occurs, it is likely that more fossil fuels will be burnt, releasing more SO2 and NOx into the atmosphere. 2. Falls onto the ground: With more chemicals in the atmosphere, a higher concentration of acid rain will fall onto the ground. 3. The acid rain starts scouring rocks: Acid rain reacts with the minerals in rocks, causing them to break down. With an increased amount of acid rain falling onto the ground, more rocks are exposed to this process, leading to a higher amount of rock scouring. 4. Destroys vegetation: Acid rain can lead to the destruction of vegetation, further exacerbating the issue of a lack of conservation. 5. The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment: With less vegetation, the environment becomes more vulnerable to the negative effects of acid rain, including soil erosion and landslides.

Options: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"a). no; Let me explain, little buddy! 1. The first question is asking if a dead car battery can be fully recharged by jump starting the car and driving around. Well, when a car battery is dead, you can jump start it by connecting it to another car's battery. After the jump start, driving around can help recharge the dead battery. However, it might not get completely recharged, especially if it's old or has a problem. It's a good idea to use a battery charger when you get home to ensure proper charging. 2. The second question is asking how someone knows if a car battery needs to be replaced or just needs a jump start. If a car doesn't start, it could be because of a dead battery. In that case, try jump starting the car. If it starts and runs fine, then the battery might have just needed a jump start. But if this keeps happening, or the car struggles to start even after a jump, the battery might be old or damaged and needs to be replaced.

Carrie purchased her razor two years ago and has been using it consistently since then, while Patricia only bought hers a few months ago. Step 1: Assess the context provided in the given text. In the text, we are comparing the dullness of razors owned by Carrie and Patricia. Step 2: Identify the reason for the difference in dullness between the two razors. In this case, the reason is that Carrie's razor has been in use for a longer period of time as compared to Patricia's. Step 3: Elaborate on the difference in razor usage between the two individuals. Since Carrie's razor has been in use for two years, the blade has most likely faced significant wear and tear, leading it to become dull. On the other hand, Patricia's razor is relatively newer, having been used for just a few months. Step 4: Highlight the possible consequences of the difference in razor dullness. A dull razor can lead to an ineffective and potentially uncomfortable shaving experience. This means that Carrie might not be getting as close or as smooth a shave as Patricia, and she may even experience skin irritation due to the dull blades pulling on her hair. Step 5: Suggest a solution or provide advice. To improve her shaving experience, Carrie should consider replacing her razor more frequently or opt for better quality blades that could last longer without becoming dull.

Under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), there is no general federal common law. Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law, such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision, statute, or regulation (which in turn was enacted as part of the Constitution or after). Federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law, which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law. Only in a few narrow limited areas, like maritime law, has the Constitution expressly authorized the continuation of English common law at the federal level (meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit, subject to the limitations of stare decisis).

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which county experienced more infiltration?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Dirk County experienced more infiltration as compared to Saulk County. Dirk County was subject to heavy precipitation and a steady rainfall throughout the last month, which led to a significant amount of water infiltrating the soil. This consistent and persistent presence of rain caused the soil to become highly saturated, leading to additional problems like flooding, as described in the paragraph. The water infiltrating the soil and creating a more saturated groundwater table ultimately resulted in the aforementioned disastrous effects on the county, such as an influx of flood events and massive water infiltration. On the other hand, Saulk County experienced a few thunderstorms during the same period. Although these storms did result in some amount of runoff, the infiltration and subsequent soil saturation levels were comparatively much lower than Dirk County. The reduced number of storms and less intense rainfall allowed the soil in Saulk County to better handle the water infiltration without reaching saturation levels that would have caused widespread problems. In conclusion, Dirk County experienced a higher infiltration rate and increased soil saturation levels compared to Saulk County due to a stronger and more continuous weather phenomena. The significant difference in the intensity and duration of rainfall between the two counties is the primary factor that contributed to the notable variance in infiltration and soil saturation levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Run the cheese through a food processor. Answer:","completion":"1). Run the cheese along side of a cheese grater. Explanation: The traditional and most common way to grate Parmesan cheese is by using a cheese grater. This allows for more precise control over the size and texture of the grated cheese. It also preserves the flavor and texture of the cheese better than a food processor. Option 2, running the cheese through a food processor, is not incorrect, but it's an alternative way more so than the best way.

Oranges are freezing and millions of tropical fish are dying in Florida, and it could be just the beginning of a decades-long deep freeze, says Professor Mojib Latif, one of the world's leading climate modelers. Latif thinks the cold snap Americans have been suffering through is only the beginning. He says we're in for 30 years of cooler temperatures -- a mini ice age, he calls it, basing his theory on an analysis of natural cycles in water temperatures in the world's oceans. Latif, a professor at the Leibniz Institute at Germany's Kiel University and an author of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, believes the lengthy cold weather is merely a pause -- a 30-years-long blip -- in the larger cycle of global warming, which postulates that temperatures will rise rapidly over the coming years. At a U.N. conference in September, Latif said that changes in ocean currents known as the North Atlantic Oscillation could dominate over manmade global warming for the next few decades. Latif said the fluctuations in these currents could also be responsible for much of the rise in global temperatures seen over the past 30 years. Latif is a key member of the UN's climate research arm, which has long promoted the concept of global warming. He told the Daily Mail that \\"a significant share of the warming we saw from 1980 to 2000 and at earlier periods in the 20th Century was due to these cycles -- perhaps as much as 50 percent.\\" The U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSICD) agrees that the cold temperatures are unusual, and that the world's oceans may play a part in temperatures on land. \\"Has ocean variability contributed to variations in surface temperature? Absolutely, no one's denying that,\\" said Mark Serreze, senior research scientist with NSIDC. But the Center disagrees with Latif's conclusions, instead arguing that the cold snap is still another sign of global warming. \\"We are indeed starting to see the effects of the rise in greenhouse gases,\\" he said. Many parts of the world have been suffering through record-setting snowfalls and arctic temperatures. The Midwest saw wind chills as low as 49 degrees below zero last week, while Europe saw snows so heavy that Eurostar train service and air travel were canceled across much of the continent. In Asia, Beijing was hit by its heaviest snowfall in 60 years. And as for the cold weather? \\"This is just the roll of the dice, the natural variability inherent to the system,\\" explained Serreze.

Consequently, citizens are eager to hear President Obama outline a comprehensive and targeted plan that addresses the root causes of radicalism, outlines specific military and non-military actions designed to diminish ISIS' capabilities and presence in the region, and outlines a long-term strategy for securing regional stability through diplomacy, economic aid, and humanitarian assistance. Additionally, while Americans rally behind the notion of decisively dealing with ISIS, there remains a strong desire to avoid deploying large numbers of US ground troops, preferring a more measured approach that relies on a combination of air power, special forces, and support for local forces. As such, President Obama must navigate the delicate balance between resolutely combating the ISIS threat and reassuring a nation already burdened by the long-term costs of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan that his plan will not result in another protracted and costly ground war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rocket does not break down happens, how will it affect fewer waves hit the coast. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To answer your question, it is important to clarify the perturbation hypothesis mentioned in your question. It seems that there is some confusion as rockets do not directly relate to the coastal process described. There must be a clear understanding of the perturbation and the potential factors to evaluate the direct or indirect effects on the process. The coastal process you described is as follows: 1. Waves hit the coast. 2. Waves have energy that pushes water and sediment. 3. The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper. 4. Water washes the sediment back. 5. Some sediment is left as sand. For the sake of providing an answer, I will make an assumption about the perturbation hypothesis. Let's assume that the perturbation is \\"fewer waves hitting the coast,\\" as this would be more relevant to the coastal process. With the perturbation hypothesis established as \\"fewer waves hitting the coast,\\" I will now analyze the direct or indirect effect it may have on the coastal process. Effect of \\"fewer waves hitting the coast\\" on the coastal process: 1. With fewer waves hitting the coast, the overall energy transferred to the water and the sediment would be reduced. 2. This reduction in energy would slow down the movement of sediment on the coastline. 3. As a result, the rate of coastal erosion would decrease. This could potentially slow down the reshaping of the coastline. 4. With less sediment being washed back into the water, the sediment accumulation on the shoreline would decrease. This might result in a less defined beach or shoreline. 5. This decrease in the amount of sediment left as sand could lead to smaller or narrower sand deposits on the beach. From this analysis, we can conclude that the perturbation hypothesis of \\"fewer waves hitting the coast\\" does have a direct effect on the coastal process by reducing erosion, sediment movement, and sand deposition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, deep inside her heart, Sarah possesses a hidden gift, an exceptional ability to understand and communicate with these mythical beasts. As the story unfolds, Sarah encounters a troubled duo: Kael, a beast tamer, and Lyra, a benevolent half-human half-beast on a quest to uncover a powerful relic that projects the most potent magical energy across the realms. The artifact, known as Zyfus' Orb, has been stolen by a diabolical villain, Thornstal, who desires to subvert the Orb's radiance to augment the power of a demonic creature known as 'The Other Beast.' Thornstal believes that by using the Orb, he can gain control over every beast in Elarys and instigate an era of tyranny. Upon learning of Thornstal's nefarious intentions, Sarah, Kael, and Lyra join forces to avert the impending catastrophe. Their journey is filled with testing obstacles, unexpected friendships, and epic battles, challenging not only their physical abilities but their moral compass as well. As they delve deeper into the plot, Sarah discovers her bond with the beasts runs deeper than merely communicating with them. She holds the key to decipher the ancient manuscript called 'The Chronicle of Shadows,' a text that reveals the secrets of controlling the power within the Zyfus' Orb. In the movie's climax, Sarah confronts Thornstal, who has successfully summoned and possesses control over 'The Other Beast.' The epic battle ensues, showcasing the battle between good and evil, where Sarah displays newfound abilities in tandem with the mystical beasts on their side. Despite their best efforts and an intense struggle, it becomes apparent that the only way to subdue the overpowering force of 'The Other Beast' is for Sarah to unleash her true powers and make an ultimate sacrifice. With tearful goodbyes and a heavy heart, Sarah courageously embraces the decision to use her power to exterminate 'The Other Beast' even when it means putting her life at stake. During the final encounter, Sarah's iconic kill severs the tie between Thornstal and 'The Other Beast,' destroying both antagonists. The Orb, released from the malevolent grasp, returns to a state of purity and equilibrium. In the movie's closing scenes, Sarah's selfless action is commemorated through a memorial in her village. Elarys is once again a realm filled with harmony, where humans and magical creatures coexist, forging friendships and prospering together. The legacy of Sarah's bravery transcends generations, perpetually reminding inhabitants of Elarys of love, loyalty, and the importance of understanding the world beyond the veil of shadows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dallben learns that the Horned King is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which is capable of creating an invincible army of undead warriors, the \\"Cauldron-Born\\". Dallben fears the Horned King may try to steal his pig Hen Wen, which has oracular powers, and use her to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by the Horned King's forces. Taran follows them to the Horned King's stronghold. Along the way, he encounters the small, pestering companion Gurgi, who joins Taran on his search. Taran leaves Gurgi to sneak into the castle and rescues Hen Wen, who flees, but all too soon he is captured himself and taken to the courtroom, found guilty and thrown into jail. A fellow captive named Princess Eilonwy frees Taran as she is trying to make her own escape.

Comet A and comet B would enter the inner solar system. But comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Moreover, comet A is categorized as a bright comet, but comet B is categorized as a faint comet. and a hint : A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Please answer this question : Whcih comet would be visible to naked eye, comet A or comet B? A:","completion":"Given the information provided, we can analyze the visibility of the comets from Earth. Comet A is described as a bright comet, while comet B is categorized as a faint comet. In the context provided, brightness is a critical factor when considering the visibility of a comet to the naked eye. Additionally, both comets A and B are said to enter the inner solar system, which further facilitates the possibility of visibility. The hint provided explains that a comet's tail and coma become visible when the comet is illuminated by the Sun. When comets enter the inner solar system, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out, allowing the formation of a tail and coma. The hint also states that most comets are too faint to be seen without a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Based on this information, it is more likely that comet A, which is described as a bright comet, would be visible to the naked eye when it enters the inner solar system. The combination of its brightness and proximity to the Sun would allow it to display a visible tail and coma, enabling those on Earth to observe it without the aid of a telescope. On the other hand, comet B, being categorized as a faint comet, may not be easily visible to the naked eye due to its lower brightness.

As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related films, The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939). The film centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves and manager George Allison was given a speaking part. More recently, the book Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was twice adapted for the cinema – the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseball's Boston Red Sox.

For years, Kathy Broussard flew her single-engine Piper Cherokee across Texas, bringing critically ill patients to Houston for life-saving medical treatments. \\"I would pick up patients and drop them off ... and they would call a cab, and that was how it was done,\\" said Broussard, who was part of a group of volunteer pilots who flew in patients from all over Texas. In 1999, one of her frequent-flyer patients, Eva, called Broussard and said she wouldn't be coming in. \\"She started crying and says, 'Kathy, I don't have cab fare.' \\" Houston, Texas, is home to many medical centers, including MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the world's premier cancer treatment facilities. But cab fare from Houston's main airports to the treatment centers can range from 50 to more than 100 each way. For patients struggling financially, that expense alone can keep them from getting the treatments they need to stay alive. \\"People lose everything. They lose their cars; they lose their homes. They're living with relatives. They wouldn't have cab fare. A lot of people would just stay home and die,\\" said Broussard, 60. \\"And that's just not acceptable.\\" So Broussard started a group she called Houston Ground Angels, organizing volunteers to drive patients to and from Houston's airports and treatment centers for free. Today, driving her red pickup along Texas highways, Broussard credits Eva -- who passed away in 2001 from colon cancer -- as the inspiration for the program. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes. \\"I said, 'Eva, I'll drive you down.' I put her in my truck and went downtown. And then, all of the sudden, it just popped in my head, 'I wonder if [other people in] Houston would be interested in this?' \\" Broussard placed an ad in the Houston Chronicle calling for volunteer drivers, and the response was overwhelming. About 300 people called to sign up. At the time, Broussard was a single mother of five working full-time at an oil refinery. She spent her spare time coordinating the drivers, or \\"ground angels.\\" When pilots alerted Broussard that they were flying in a patient, she would arrange for a ground angel to meet them. \\"I was on the phone all the time. I carried a spiral notebook with all the volunteers' names and numbers in it,\\" Broussard said. Ultimately, the pilots liked the program so much that they asked to join, and the organization became the Houston Ground Angels and Pilots. Today, the group includes nearly 50 pilots and 300 drivers. Patients contact the organization to request ground transportation from a Houston airport or a flight from their regional airport. Requests are posted on the group's website, and volunteers sign up for each \\"mission.\\" Missions take place seven days a week. Rides are provided to patients who arrive into the Houston area on a commercial flight or who've been flown in to a regional airport by one of the program's pilots. The group also helps fly in patients from the Gulf Coast, Oklahoma and Arkansas by working with other volunteer flying organizations whose pilots cover part of the distance. Since 2001, the group has completed about 6,000 missions -- most of them rides, along with hundreds of flights. Broussard says many volunteers are drawn to the group because they have lost loved ones to cancer. Cathy Laflen, 62, has been relying on the group for eight years. After she was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2001, the cost of treatment crippled her financially. Unable to work, she lost her home and her car. Laflen, who lives about 4½ hours from Houston by car, was referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center but lacked the funds or transportation to get there. With the help of Broussard's team, Laflen has been able to fly into Houston and get treated. She credits the volunteers with giving her hope. \\"They've saved my life,\\" Laflen said. \\"Anytime that I need to come up here, they do it. The ground angels have everything set up. I don't have to worry. I would have died a long time ago, because they have nothing like this down where I live.\\" Patients receiving transportation from Broussard's group must submit proof of their medical need. Those requesting flights also must have a letter from their doctor saying that they need air transport and that they are well enough for it. Recently retired, Broussard is now a full-time volunteer. She and her team aim to make sure that patients coming into town for treatment travel without stress. \\"There's no worry, because there is going to be somebody that's going to fly them,\\" she said. \\"There will be somebody that will pick them up. They're not thrown to the wolves in the big Houston metropolis, of being afraid of where to go.\\" Broussard -- who has also opened her house to patients who can't afford a place to stay -- said the program hits home the most when she sees patients thriving despite being told they had a limited life expectancy. \\"They tell us all the time that they get their strength through us,\\" she said. \\"If they only knew it's the other way around.\\" Want to get involved?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil. He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. Which fruit have a lower sugar content candied plums or fresh oranges? A:","completion":"Candied plums will have a higher sugar content than fresh oranges due to the preservation process involved in making candied fruit. In the candying process, the fruit is soaked in a sugar syrup solution, absorbing sugar and becoming saturated with it. This results in significantly elevated sugar content compared to the fruit's natural state. In contrast, fresh oranges have not been subjected to any preservation process and contain only their natural sugars. As a result, fresh oranges will have a lower sugar content compared to candied plums. Considering the nutritional values, a medium-sized fresh orange has approximately 12g of sugar, while a serving of candied plums (about 28g or 1 ounce) can contain upwards of 20g of sugar or more, depending on the specific recipe and concentration of the sugar syrup used.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Philadelphia News From CBS3 Philly Four-month-old Journi Black is on a long road to recovery after a raccoon attacked her inside a home on the 2100 block of North 22nd Street on Wednesday night. “It’s just ridiculous,” said Samuel Black, the girl’s father. “My daughter could have lost her life.” Animal control officers set a trap for the raccoon to prevent this from happening again. Doctors told the family it will take at least a year for the baby to fully recover. “My daughter was laying on the bed sleeping and I went to take my son to the bathroom. We heard a sound upstairs and we see a raccoon run down the steps,” said Ashley Rodgers, the child’s mother. “When I finally got to her, she was laying on the floor so it had dragged her off the bed, across the room, and she was bleeding and crying and her whole face was red.” 100 Million Grant Sending Sesame Street To The Middle East It’s been mere days since Rodgers moved into the home with her daughter and 6-year-old son, Jordan.

Everybody needs to leave out of there,” Rodgers said. Rodgers says she contacted her landlord after the first raccoon sighting earlier in the evening, something neighbors say is common, especially with trash in the area. “It’s terrible around here with these raccoons, yes it is,” said Barbara Butler.

Given the question: An aquatic animal requires great amounts of water to survive, and fish and other small aquatic animals can be placed in the aquarium for visual purposes. Given these facts, what do fish require to survive among the following options: - food particles - ocean water - salt and water. - Getting eaten - Heavy boots - aerobic capacity - Great amounts of water - Wait staff The answer is:","completion":"Great amounts of water. Fish require a suitable aquatic environment to survive and thrive, which translates to having an adequate amount of water in their habitat. Although the other options listed have some relevance within specific contexts, none are as essential as the primary requirement of water for fish survival. Let's briefly review the other options and understand why they are not as crucial: 1. Food particles: While fish do need food to survive, the question asks about the essential element among the given options that fish require. The presence of water is more fundamental than having food particles since fish cannot survive without water even if there's food available. 2. Ocean water: Although many fish species live in ocean water, not all fish require ocean water to survive. There are various species of fish that thrive in freshwater or brackish environments. 3. Salt and water: Saltwater is essential for marine fish species, but there are numerous freshwater fish that do not require salt in their water. Therefore, while salt may be necessary for a specific fish habitat, it is not universally essential. 4. Getting eaten: Fish getting eaten is not a requirement for their survival; in fact, it is quite the opposite. 5. Heavy boots: Heavy boots hold no relevance to fish survival. 6. Aerobic capacity: Although aerobic capacity refers to an organism's ability to take in, transport, and utilize oxygen efficiently, this term is not a direct requirement for fish survival. A proper aquatic environment with sufficient oxygen levels is essential, but fish have evolved various ways to extract and utilize oxygen from the water. 7. Wait staff: Wait staff is irrelevant to the survival requirements of fish. In conclusion, among all the options provided, fish require great amounts of water to survive. The aquatic environment in which they live must maintain suitable water quality, temperature, and oxygen levels for fish to thrive. Other factors like food availability, water type (freshwater, saltwater, or brackish), and specific water parameters are essential but not as universally critical as having a sufficient volume of water to create a suitable habitat for fish."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who directed the spaghetti Dollar westerns","completion":"The Spaghetti Westerns, also known as Italian Westerns, gained popularity in the 1960s, and the Dollar Trilogy is widely regarded as the most successful and influential series within this genre. The director behind the Dollar Trilogy, and hence the person who directed the spaghetti Dollar Westerns, was the acclaimed Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone. The Dollar Trilogy consists of the following three movies: 1. A Fistful of Dollars (1964) 2. For a Few Dollars More (1965) 3. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966) Sergio Leone was born on January 3, 1929, in Rome, Italy, and is considered one of the pioneers of the Spaghetti Western genre. His distinctive style heavily influenced many other filmmakers, and his works have garnered immense attention and admiration over the years. Leone's path towards directing began with him working as an assistant director and screenwriter in the Italian film industry alongside notable directors like Vittorio De Sica. In 1960, he directed his first feature film, The Colossus of Rhodes. However, it was his venture into the Spaghetti Western genre that truly cemented his position in cinematic history. In 1964, Leone directed A Fistful of Dollars, which starred Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name, a wandering gunslinger. The film was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Japanese samurai movie, Yojimbo (1961). A Fistful of Dollars became an international success, launching both Leone's and Eastwood's careers in the global film industry. Following the success of A Fistful of Dollars, Leone directed its sequel, For a Few Dollars More, in 1965, once again featuring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. The film also starred Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volonté. For a Few Dollars More expanded on the themes and the stylistic elements of the first film and garnered even more commercial success. In 1966, Leone directed the third film of the trilogy, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which starred Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach. The film was a critical and commercial success and is widely considered one of the greatest movies in the Western genre. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was unique for its time, as it presented a more nuanced and morally ambiguous perspective on the characters and the world they inhabited, which was a departure from the black-and-white morality prevalent in American Westerns. Sergio Leone's spaghetti Dollar Westerns have left an indelible mark on the history of cinema. His innovative storytelling techniques, unconventional cinematography, and characteristic use of music, particularly in collaboration with composer Ennio Morricone, transformed the Western genre and continue to influence modern filmmakers. Leone passed away on April 30, 1989, leaving behind a rich and unforgettable cinematic legacy."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

A celebrated scholar and artist, Owen was a retained lecturer in Italian at the University of Oxford's Pembroke College. She continued to teach as her health declined during the past year. Owen was an expert in medieval Italian literature and a renowned artist and printmaker. One of her last works, a series of prints inspired by the cantos of Dante’s first book of The Divine Comedy, will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR Art Gallery. While Owen and Yorke were together for 23 years, she lived a private life and was rarely seen in public with the singer. The couple had two children together -- a son, Noah, and a daughter, Agnes, age 15 and 12. Their August 2015 separation heavily influenced Radiohead’s latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool. ||||| It is with great sadness that the College marks the death of Dr Rachel Owen, who was a Retained Lecturer in Italian here at Pembroke. Dr Owen was an internationally renowned artist – mixing photography and printmaking – and at the same time a scholar in medieval Italian literature. As Retained Lecturer, she used to teach Dante’s Divine Comedy to Pembroke’s finalists in Italian. Dr Owen’s parallel passion for art and literature was already established in her university years at Exeter, where she studied Italian and Fine Art. She then moved to Royal Holloway, London, where she completed a PhD on the illustrations of the early manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy. Each year, her Pembroke students enjoyed the pleasure and the privilege of a guided tour through the manuscripts of the Divine Comedy held at the Bodleian Library. Despite her declining health from cancer in the last year, she asked to continue to teach, which she did right until the end of last Michaelmas term. She was 48 years old and leaves behind a son, Noah, and a daughter, Agnes, aged 15 and 12. One of her latest artistic productions was a series of prints inspired by the Cantos of Dante’s first book of the Divine Comedy. The prints will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR Art Gallery during Trinity term.

Cristiano Ronaldo has once again trained for Portugal ahead of their Group G clash with USA on Sunday - despite being warned that he risks his career by playing on at the World Cup. The 29-year-old Real Madrid forward has been struggling with a knee injury and doctors have told him that he could shorten his career by playing for Portugal in the short-term.
