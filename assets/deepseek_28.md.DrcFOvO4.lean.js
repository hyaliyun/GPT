Cougar The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the mountain lion, puma, panther, or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the greatest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the second-heaviest cat in the New World, after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although there are daytime sightings. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas. OPTIONS: A. no. B. yes. Is this statement correct \\"are pumas cougars and mountain lions the same animal\\"?","completion":"B. Yes. The statement \\"are pumas, cougars, and mountain lions the same animal\\" is correct. These three names all refer to the same species, Puma concolor, which is a large felid native to the Americas.

Although the exact name assigned to the animal may vary based on geographical location or cultural preferences, pumas, cougars, and mountain lions all describe the same majestic predator. The cougar is known for its stealth, elusive nature, and solitary behavior. Often active during dawn, dusk, or nighttime, this crepuscular predator is even related to smaller felines like the domestic cat, placing it within the subfamily Felinae, rather than the Pantherinae subfamily that includes the jaguar.

Write highlights for this article: Was it at 2.01pm on Saturday that Lewis Hamilton’s extraordinary miscalculation brought an end to his dreams of a second world title and his wider hopes of becoming an all-time great of his sport? It may yet unfold that this conjurer of the track, the phenomenal Lewis, will drive as brilliantly in the British Grand Prix on Sunday as he acted foolishly in qualifying here and restore himself in his title fight with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Nothing can ever be ruled out with Hamilton, this see-sawing driver, but on Saturday night the feeling was that a dramatic, defining, damning moment had left its imprint on the 2014 season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch on-board lap with Lewis Hamilton round the Silverstone circuit. Rattled: Lewis Hamilton (left) has allowed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to get under his skin at times. The incident came in the final lap of qualifying, when Hamilton decided to abort his final flying lap for no compelling reason. Rosberg passed him, set the fastest lap and will start the race from pole. Hamilton, who trails Rosberg by 29 points, will start from sixth. Why? ‘I don’t know,’ said Hamilton, at his surly worst when asked for an explanation in front of the BBC cameras. ‘I don’t have much of an answer. I just decided not to do the lap.’ With that he walked off almost as ill-advisedly as he had turned off the track a few minutes earlier.Where was his respect for ‘the greatest fans in the world’, the British public he had buttered up a few days earlier with what now sounded like empty platitudes? Too slow: Rosberg passed Hamilton to set the fastest lap and will start Sunday's race from pole. But back to qualifying, which was beset by changing conditions: drizzle, rain, cloudy but dry, sunny. Hamilton had set the fastest time in his first lap of the final session before rain fell harder and all the cars came in. Niki Would the rain relent, allowing them to go out again? Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, said: ‘The team wanted them to stay in, but the drivers said they wanted to get in another lap, so it was decided they would.’ In that final, supposed shootout, Hamilton made a small mistake, locking up, at the Arena - Turn Four - and, believing it to be too wet to beat his previous time, pulled out of the lap and let Rosberg through to capitalise on the markedly drier conditions at the end of track. Mercedes put out a statement a few minutes later to explain Hamilton’s side of the story. ‘I made a mistake today and pulled out of the lap when I should have kept going,’ he said. Mistake: Hamilton's miscalculation could end his dreams of a second world title. ‘It was a tough qualifying with the changing conditions and we got through most of it really well, until the most important part. ‘It was my decision, a bad call, and that decided my qualifying. ‘I’m so sorry to have disappointed the fans here today as their support has been fantastic and I’ll do what I can to have a great race for them on Sunday. I need to have a start like I had in Austria two weeks ago and then do my best to get back to the front. You never know what might happen. ‘It’s difficult when you're just out of the car to express your emotions and see the positive, but I’ll go back to the team and my family now and we'll build up for tomorrow from there.’ Pole: Rosberg (centre) Sebastian Vettel, and Jenson Button (left) will start from the front at Silverstone. Well, that was like the Gettysburg address compared to the muddle of excuses – amid some perfectly reasonable excuses – put forward by Hamilton when he came to his press conference later. His funniest claim was that, ‘I never give up’. So, what were you doing abandoning the lap, Lewis? He again accepted that it was his fault, yet, contradicting that, cited the failure of the team to tell him it was faster in the final part of the lap as some sort of mitigation for his decision. What makes Saturday’s antics most bizarre is that Hamilton, for all his ups and downs, has always been a racer, a fight-to-the-end warrior. But here at Silverstone, of all places, where conditions are famously different from one end of the track to another, did he decide to stop. Lead: Hamilton (right) rounds a corner ahead Rosberg during qualification on Saturday. He could have qualified second or third or fourth or fifth. In fact, he could have beaten Rosberg. There is a pattern emerging: he has made mistakes in the past most recent qualifying sessions, a part of his performance that is traditionally extremely strong. Rosberg, it seems, has rattled him. Sir Jackie Stewart, watching from the paddock, said: ‘His head certainly seems to have gone a bit.’ Finish: Button celebrates after taking third position in the qualifying session of the British Formula One Grand Prix. One question is whether Hamilton has the intellectual gifts to find the answers against the calculating, clever Rosberg. Another is whether he will resist thinking the team are against him. Ostensibly declining to wade into psychological warfare, the German did so stealthily, saying: ‘With regards to the championship, it’s good for me that Lewis is down in sixth.’ Hamilton finished the afternoon by, again, promising the fans more today. It all sounded a little hollow in the circumstances.","completion":"Highlights: - Lewis Hamilton's miscalculation during the final lap of qualifying allowed Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg to pass him, set the fastest lap, and start the race from pole position. - Hamilton, currently 29 points behind Rosberg, will start the British Grand Prix from sixth position. - The decision to abort the final flying lap was solely Hamilton's, who later apologized to his fans for the mistake and vowed to perform better during the race. - Some speculate that Hamilton's recent series of mistakes during qualifying sessions may indicate that Rosberg has rattled him; others question if Hamilton has the intellectual abilities to outsmart the calculating Rosberg."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Explanation: In this sentence, \\"soft power\\" means the ability to influence others gently, without using force. \\"Ethnocentric attitudes and policies\\" means focusing only on one's own culture, which can weaken the soft power.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? See options at the end Rebecca was very lax with their studying in school while Amy was very diligent. a). Rebecca mostly got C grades in their classes. b). Amy mostly got C grades in their classes.","completion":"In this sentence, we have two subjects, Rebecca and Amy, each with distinct behaviors when it comes to studying. Rebecca is described as being lax, meaning she's not very strict or focused on her studies, while Amy is described as diligent, meaning she's hardworking and devoted to her studies. Given the behaviors of the two individuals, the appropriate option for the sentence ending would be: a). Rebecca mostly got C grades in their classes. This option demonstrates the correlation between Rebecca's slack attitude towards studying and her average performance in her classes, as reflected by her C grades. C grades typically represent average performance, which is a likely outcome for someone who does not prioritize studying or invest significant effort into their schoolwork. Conversely, someone like Amy, who is diligent, would be expected to achieve higher grades due to her dedication and hard work. It is important to note that the option (b). Amy mostly got C grades in their classes, wouldn't be suitable to describe the outcome of Amy's diligence in studying. A diligent person would generally be associated with better grades, such as A's and B's, due to their commitment to doing well academically. In conclusion, the sentence would read: \\"Rebecca was very lax with their studying in school while Amy was very diligent. Rebecca mostly got C grades in their classes.\\" This sentence effectively illustrates the contrast between Rebecca's and Amy's approaches to studying, as well as the possible consequences of their respective attitudes towards academic performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

Dominica is a small island country located in the Caribbean region's Lesser Antilles archipelago. It is situated between the French territories of Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique to the south. The island is known for its lush rainforest, stunning waterfalls, and unique volcanic features. Roseau can be found on the island's southwestern coast, and it serves as the heart of Dominica's government, commerce, and cultural activities. The history of Roseau dates back to the early colonization of the Caribbean by European powers. The city was initially founded by the French during the late 1600s and named after the nearby Roseau River. Over the centuries, Roseau changed hands multiple times between France and Great Britain, with the British ultimately gaining permanent control in 1815. The island gained independence from Britain on November 3, 1978, and since then, Roseau has played an essential role in the development of an independent Dominica. Although Roseau is not a very large city, it does offer a variety of amenities and attractions for visitors. Some of the notable sites in Roseau include: 1. The Dominica Museum: located in the center of Roseau, this museum features exhibits on the history, culture, and natural environment of the island. 2. The Old Market of Roseau: a historic market square surrounded by 18th-century buildings, where visitors can find local crafts, fresh produce, and other items. 3. The Roseau Cathedral: a prominent Catholic church built in the Gothic and Romanesque styles, it is an important center for spiritual life on the island. 4. The Botanical Gardens: a large park offering a variety of flora and fauna native to Dominica, as well as a sanctuary for the country's national bird, the Imperial Amazon parrot. 5. Morne Bruce: a hill overlooking Roseau that provides incredible views of the city, harbor, and surrounding landscape. In addition to these attractions, Roseau is known for its lively colorful markets, local shops, and delicious Caribbean cuisine offered in various restaurants and street vendors. The city's port is also a popular destination for cruise ships, bringing a constant flow of tourists eager to explore the beautiful island of Dominica. As the gateway to Dominica's natural wonders, Roseau plays an essential role in the island's tourism industry. Visitors who come to explore Dominica's pristine rainforest, volcanic features, and unique attractions often begin their adventures in Roseau, making it an integral part of the island's vibrant history, culture, and economic development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is while visiting Peter's apartment that Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes smitten with one of the four, the alluring Regine (Julie Carmen). Charley drives Alex back to her dorm room and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him.

The question seems to have a typo or confusion - it appears to refer to a \\"heating element\\" which is unrelated to the owl hunting process described. Assuming the question intends to discuss some kind of heating source or external heat, it's worth noting that owls rely primarily on their sensitive hearing and keen vision to find and hunt prey at night. A heating element working properly would not have any significant impact on an owl's ability to sit still, locate prey through hearing, see prey in the dark, fly silently, or catch prey with its talons and beak.

We would like you to assess the QUALITY of each of the following argument (discussing Gun Control) and determine if the argument is Valid or Invalid. A valid argument is clearly interpretable and either expresses an argument, or a premise or a conclusion that can be used in an argument for the topic of gun control. An invalid argument is a phrase that cannot be interpreted as an argument or not on the topic of gun control. The fact is if you aren't military oror a farmer a gun is a toy and used in a recreational manner.","completion":"To assess the quality of the given argument and determine its validity, let's break it down step by step and justify the reasoning. Argument: \\"The fact is if you aren't military or a farmer, a gun is a toy and used in a recreational manner.\\" 1. The argument starts with the phrase \\"The fact is,\\" which implies that the following statement is a commonly accepted truth or a widely recognized fact. 2. The statement then provides two exceptions for owning a gun: being military personnel or a farmer. This acknowledges that there might be some legitimate, non-recreational reasons for owning a gun. 3. The argument continues with the claim that a gun is a \\"toy\\" when not used by military personnel or farmers. The use of the word \\"toy\\" here is likely intended to diminish the seriousness of owning a gun and suggest that non-professional uses of guns are more for entertainment than anything else. 4. Finally, the statement concludes that guns are \\"used in a recreational manner\\" when not owned by military personnel or farmers. This implies that the purpose of owning a gun outside of those professional contexts is mainly for fun and leisure activities. By examining the argument step by step, we can see that it presents a clear and interpretable claim on the topic of gun control, which is that guns serve a mainly recreational purpose for people who are not military personnel or farmers. This argument could be used in a broader discussion on gun control as a premise or conclusion. Therefore, we can determine that the argument is valid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: After the rise of Young Turks to power through their 1908 revolution, they began imposing a more centralized system of rule across the Ottoman Empire. This meant to put an end to local particularism, which was seen first in the violent suppression of the Hauran Druze Rebellion in Syria in 1909. During the Syrian rebellion, the Ottomans succeeded in suppressing the Jabal Druze revolt after conquering the villages, forcibly registering villagers and disarming them, collecting taxes in cash or cattle, and conscripting 1000 men into the Ottoman army. Ottoman governor Sami Pasha al-Faruqi wanted to apply same measures in Transjordan: villages in Ajlun were encircled by 400 Ottoman soldiers who disarmed the villagers and took 85 conscripts. Governmental troops in Al-Salt and Madaba issued identity papers as a prelude to conscription. Sami Pasha sent a telegram on 6 November 1910 from Jabal Druze to the Al-Karak Mutasarrıf Muhemet Tahir Pasha, requesting that the residents of the town demonstrate their loyalty to the Empire by ceding their weapons and submitting to personal registration. This was seen differently by the local population; measures of disarmament and conscription. The Mutasarrıf conveyed the message to the residents, who responded by requesting that they be allowed to keep their weapons for protection against Bedouin raiders. Sami Pasha assured them that the state would only conduct registration of people and lands but sent a large number of troops into the area, undermining his credibility.","completion":"What were the consequences of the centralized system of rule imposed by the Young Turks after their 1908 revolution on local particularism in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in the violent suppression of the Hauran Druze Rebellion in Syria in 1909 and the subsequent measures taken by Ottoman governor Sami Pasha al-Faruqi in Transjordan, including the encirclement of villages, disarmament and conscription of village residents, and the issuing of identity papers as a prelude to conscription, especially in the context of Sami Pasha's telegram requesting the residents of the town of Al-Karak to demonstrate loyalty to the Empire by ceding their weapons and submitting to personal registration, and how did these actions impact the local population's perception of the Ottoman Empire, particularly with regard to their requests to retain their weapons for protection against Bedouin raiders and the subsequent deployment of a large number of Ottoman troops into the area?"},{"prompt":"Question: The message was short.

Question: \\"When was an aircraft carrier sunk?\\" Context: \\"The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"An aircraft carrier was sunk during the Norwegian campaign in 1940, specifically HMS Glorious, which was sunk by German battleships.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A boy who aimed a laser pointer from a toy at the rearview mirror inside a public bus in Germany permanently damaged the retina of the bus driver's right eye, a new case report reveals. The boy was playing with a laser pointer while sitting about 50 feet (15 meters) away from the driver, according to the case report. When the child pointed the laser at the rearview mirror inside the bus, a beam of red light emitted by the toy reflected off the mirror and into the eye of the 44-year-old bus driver, according to a report published online Oct. 5 in the journal BMJ Case Reports. Laser pointers are handheld, penlike devices typically used in lectures and business presentations to emphasize information. They are also used by astronomy buffs to point out planets and stars in the sky, and the devices are present in some children's toys as well. The boy's laser was part of a toy, and initially, the light caused blurred vision in the bus driver's right eye. After this blurriness had continued for six months, the driver sought help from an eye doctor. After examining the driver, an ophthalmologist diagnosed a subtle but detectable injury to the macula, an area near the center of the retina that is responsible for central vision. However, the vision in the driver's left eye remained normal. [9 Odd Ways Your Tech Devices May Injure You] The driver had looked into the rearview mirror about three or four times, to try to identify the passenger who was holding the laser, causing additional exposure that increased his chances for an eye injury, the report said. This is the first reported case of retinal injury caused by the laser beam of a toy, the doctors wrote in the man's case report. Laser dangers The light from a laser beam, even if it is reflected off a mirror, can be absorbed by pigmented structures within the retina that can generate heat, and cause a tiny burn, said Dr. Vincent Patalano, chief of ophthalmology at Cambridge Health Alliance and an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who was not involved in the case. That tiny burn can destroy a small area of the retina, which damages the central part of a person's visual field, he said. Although lasers can be used to treat some vision problems, such as the damage to the retina that sometimes occurs in people with diabetes, patients are told to never stare directly at the light, and the laser is used for a very short time, Patalano told Live Science. The light that lasers emit has several properties that can make it dangerous to unprotected eyes. Laser-produced light stays together in one narrow path, and it is focused on one small point, Patalano said. Laser light is also one color, and the eyes are more sensitive to certain colors of light than others, he said. In this case, though, the laser was red, which is not as harmful to the eyes as blue or green lasers, he said. The intensity of laser light also makes a difference, Patalano said. Although the exact energy output of the boy's toy laser pointer was not known, it was likely a low-energy laser, the case report said. There's not much that can be done to correct this type of vision damage, Patalano said. It's not clear why the laser affected the man's right eye only, but it could be that the beam reflected at a slightly different angle in each eye, Patalano suggested. There have been other reported incidents of laser pointers being misused, causing eye problems or putting people at risk of injury. According to a report by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), fans have disrupted sporting events by aiming laser pointers at athletes, and people have shined laser pointers at airplanes or helicopters. This is a federal crime in the United States because the glare can temporarily blind pilots, making it difficult for them to safely fly and land an aircraft. Pilots reported about 3,900 laser incidents to the FAA in 2014, and nearly 4,000 of them in 2013, according to the agency. The case report authors conclude by recommending that because kids are unlikely to understand the possible risks of lasers, children should not be allowed to use the devices.

Here we present the first case of retinal injury caused by the laser beam of a toy laser pointer operated by a school boy and directed via the rear-view mirror of a bus into the eye of the driver. This case emphasises the great importance of cautious and appropriate use of low-energy laser pointers. Laser pointers of any class should not be made available to children because they are unlikely to understand the risks of such lasers when using them in play. Previous Section Next Section Case presentation A 44-year-old public bus driver who was previously healthy with a full bilateral best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 1.0 (20/20) was exposed to the laser beam of a toy laser pointer handled by a school boy (figure 1B) from a distance of about 16.5 m (figure 1A). The beam was reflected in the inside rear-view mirror of the bus, and the driver stared into the laser light several times in order to locate the person holding the laser. Immediately after this exposure the driver complained of blurred vision in his right eye that had persisted for 6 months when the first complete ophthalmological examination was carried out.

(B) Typical handheld toy laser pointer with an output power of 5 mW. (C) Maximum permissible exposure (MPE) as power density versus exposure time for various wavelengths. (D) Maximum allowed exposure time to a laser with an optical power of 1 and 5 mW.11 The maximum permissible power density of laser beams versus exposure time for various wavelengths is shown in figure 1C, while the maximum allowed exposure time of a laser pointer with output powers of 1 and 5 mW is shown in figure 1D. Upon presentation, the driver's BCVA was 0.8 OD and 1.0 OS. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed no abnormalities in the anterior segment of either eye. Intraocular pressure was normal. Dilated ophthalmoscopy revealed barely visible retinal pigment epithelium disturbances within the temporal macula of his right eye (figure 2A) and no pathological changes in his left eye (figure 2B). A paracentral scotoma extended at up to 25° of eccentricity in his right eye (figure 2H,J), with a normal visual field in his left eye (figure 2I,K). Optical coherence tomography revealed spot-like retinal pigment epithelium disturbances temporal to the fovea of the right eye (figure 2G), with no abnormalities in his left eye (not shown). Infrared and autofluorescence images of both eyes showed normal macula patterns (figure 2C–F). Visual evoked potentials were normal and identical in both eyes (figure 2L). However, multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) showed paracentral focal disturbances with altered sum peak in the right eye (figure 2M). The mfERG of his left eye was normal (figure 2N).

Previous Section Next Section Global health problem list The subjective complaints and objective ophthalmological findings of this patient were consistent and strongly suggested that the repetitive exposure of the eye to the reflected laser spot 6 months previously had caused subtle but detectable injury to the macula. Although the exact energy of the handheld laser pointer was not determined, the descriptions and reports of those involved suggested that it was a class II or class 3R laser device (1 or 5 mW). In addition, the bus driver had looked at least three or four times into the mirror in order to locate the laser source, implying that he had received a minimum of least 10 s of cumulative exposure to the laser beam. Most cases of laser-induced maculopathies are based on accidental exposure to high-energy class IV lasers with laboratory, medical, recreational,1–3 or civil and military applications.4 Lower-energy class IIIa lasers pose little risk of retinal damage5 when used properly, but there are case reports of retinal damage caused by direct exposure to class IIIa commercial laser pointers,6–9 and to higher-energy class IIIb laser pointers.8–10 The risk of damage to the retina varies with the energy of the laser device and the duration and number of exposures. Repeated exposure to a low-energy green laser pointer can result in maculopathy and delayed choroidal neovascularisation.4 Handheld laser pointers typically have output energies in the range of 1–5 mW; the output power of toy laser pointers is limited to 1 mW. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A boy was playing with a laser pointer toy on a bus in Germany when he accidentally aimed the laser at the rearview mirror.

A navy of 10,000 vessels, including Pecheneg allies, landed on the Bithynian coast and devastated the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus’ burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with Greek fire throwers and sent them out to meet the Rus’, luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire. Liutprand of Cremona wrote that \\"the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire.\\" Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus’ fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as Nicomedia, with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack).

The Fox Wars were two conflicts between the French and the Fox Indians that occurred in the Great Lakes region from 1712 to 1733. These territories are known today as the states of Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States. The Wars exemplified colonial warfare in the transitional space of New France, occurring within the complex system of alliances and enmities with native peoples and colonial plans for expansion. The Fox controlled the Fox River system. This river was vital for the fur trade between French Canada and the North American interior, because it allowed river travel from Green Bay in Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. The French wanted the rights to use the river system to gain access to both the Mississippi and trade contacts with tribes to the west. The wars claimed thousands of lives and initiated a slave trade whereby Fox Indians were captured by native allies of New France and then sold as slaves to the French colonial population.:54 Indeed, alliances between the French and other native groups as well as those between the Fox and other native groups were an important aspect of the Wars, influencing every stage of the conflicts, including the causes, the fighting and the conclusion.:54 The First Fox War began with inter-alliance violence and ended with the surrender of a large group of Fox and the subsequent peace deal.:63:169 As was custom, peace offerings required the exchange of goods and of prisoners to account for those who died in the conflict, acknowledging the importance of this exchange for establishing peace.:64 The Second Fox War was far more destructive than the first, and ended with the near annihilation of the Fox population.:169 Answer this question: How many years did the conflicts occur between the French and the Fox Indians in the Great Lakes?","completion":"The conflicts between the French and the Fox Indians in the Great Lakes region, known as the Fox Wars, occurred over a period of approximately 21 years, from 1712 to 1733."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. It was a security feature to prevent them from sneaking out: This option suggests the key requirement may have been a deliberate aspect of the door's design to control the occupants' movement. It could prevent children from leaving without permission or even deter potential intruders. B. It was a way to remind the owner always to have their house keys: This option infers that the door's design encourages responsible key management by requiring a key to unlock it. As a result, the homeowner would always be conscious of where their keys are to avoid being locked in or out of their home. C. It was a mistake made by the person who installed the door: This option posits that the door's peculiar design was unintentional. The installer may have made an error during the installation, leaving the residents needing a key to unlock it. D.

Options: - meditate - medicated - confusion - epilepsy - hallucination Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the question – The question asks for a way through which people going into trance may see things that do not exist. Step 2: Evaluate the options – I will assess each option to see if it aligns with the situation described in the question. - meditate: While meditation can lead to a heightened sense of awareness, it typically focuses on mental clarity and does not involve seeing things that do not exist. - medicated: Being medicated suggests that someone is taking medication, which may alter their perception, but it is not necessarily connected to trances or seeing nonexistent things. - confusion: Confusion is a state of being uncertain or unclear, but it does not inherently involve seeing things that do not exist. - epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder causing seizures, which may sometimes lead to altered perception, but it is not specifically about seeing things that do not exist during trances. - hallucination: A hallucination involves seeing, hearing, or feeling something that does not exist or is not present. This aligns with the question's description of seeing things that do not exist during a trance.

Please answer the following question: Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully. I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him. Most definitely the most unforgettable classmate. Why were the students happy to see the bully gone? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Because the bully farts B. Because the teachers have tears in their eyes C. not enough information D. Because there will be no more unnecessary bullying and assault on them Answer:","completion":"D.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Casey had robbed a bank and he remained at large and was not even seen. Given the context: How would you describe Casey? Possible answers: clumsy, stealthy, invincible The answer to this question is:","completion":"Stealthy Based on the given context, it would be most appropriate to describe Casey as stealthy. When someone is able to rob a bank and remain at large without being seen, they have successfully demonstrated their ability to move and act covertly and skillfully to avoid detection. This effectively highlights Casey's stealth-like qualities. By definition, stealthy refers to someone who can move or act in a secretive, quiet, or unnoticeable manner, often to carry out a plan without attracting attention or being detected. In the context of a bank robbery, being stealthy would require a high level of skill, planning, and adaptability. It would involve careful consideration of how to bypass security systems, surveillance cameras, and even law enforcement, all while remaining undetected by eyewitnesses. To successfully carry out the robbery and remain unseen, Casey would have had to carefully plan each move before the heist took place. This may have involved getting access to detailed information about the bank's layout, security features, and employees' schedules. He likely had to conceal his identity and potentially use a variety of tools and disguises to avoid being recognized. Moreover, Casey might have employed advanced techniques to circumvent security measures, such as hacking into the bank's systems or using specialized devices to access secure areas. The fact that he remained unseen also suggests that he successfully evaded the police and managed to escape without leaving any traceable evidence behind. In contrast, a clumsy individual would have likely made mistakes during the robbery attempt, resulting in their swift apprehension or injury. Furthermore, the term invincible does not accurately describe Casey, as it implies an unbeatable or untouchable quality. In this situation, it is more about Casey's skill and precision, rather than being resistant to harm. In conclusion, the most accurate description for Casey based on the given context would be stealthy. His exceptional skills in evading detection and successfully robbing a bank without being seen signify a high level of expertise and secrecy necessary for achieving such a daring and complex endeavor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Why did n't both jeans fit ?","completion":"The text implies that the jeans didn't fit because they have different cuts or styles: \\"flare\\" and \\"bootleg\\".

Norman Henderson, from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), said it would take many months for the river to recover. \\"I've seen worse fish kills but this would be towards the top end,\\" he said. \\"It's a significant kill, there's no doubt about that. The latest figures we're getting from the Loughs Agency is several thousand dead fish,\\" said Mr Henderson. \\"We believe it is agricultural and we have narrowed it down to a particular part of the river and we are following a definite line of inquiry. \\"It would obviously have to be a fairly strong effluent, something like silage.\\" But there was no risk to public health, said Mr Henderson, who is a senior scientific officer with the NIEA. \\"The river is safe in the sense that it has affected the fish but there is no risk to drinking water,\\" he said. \\"The river will recover, its difficult to put an exact timescale on it but you're certainly talking many months or possibly longer before the river is back to normal. \\"Certainly the overall stocks in the river will still have taken a hit.\\" The River Faughan is an important waterway for breeding salmon. It also contains sea trout, trout, lamprey, eel and many other fish species. East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell has written to the Environment Minister Michelle McIlveen seeking answers. \\"This is a major pollution tragedy on the Faughan which is a well-known salmon and trout river in the North West for anglers,\\" he said. \\"The wider implications on this major fish kill for future generations of fish stock cannot be underestimated and it is imperative that the source of the pollution is found as soon as possible to minimise further losses.\\" Sinn FÃ©in MLA Caoimhe Archibald asked whether enough was being done to prevent such incidents. \\"This incident needs to be fully investigated, those responsible must be held accountable and brought before the courts,\\" she said. \\"The penalties imposed for incidents such as this should be as severe as the law allows. \\"At times the fines are not a sufficient deterrent and do not match the damage being done to the environment.\\" SDLP MLA for East Londonderry Gerry Mullan described the scene as like \\"something out of a horror movie.\\" \\"The news that in excess of 1,000 fish near Claudy have been killed is deeply disturbing, with eyewitness reports that this was like something out of a horror movie,\\" said Mr Mullan. \\"Causing water pollution is a criminal offence and whoever is behind this must be brought before the courts,\\" he said. \\"It is unclear how long it will take before the stretch of water recovers. I will be seeking a full report from the environment minister on this shocking situation.\\"","completion":"A lot of fish in a river called the River Faughan got really sick and died because something bad, like pollution from a farm, got into the water. It hurt the fish, but it didn't harm the water we drink. It will take a long time for the river to get better and have lots of fish again. People who care about the river want to find out what caused the pollution and make sure it doesn't happen again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:Fletcher Shipping, of Portlethen, owned four ships for leasing, with support in the past three years from the Scottish government-funded Scottish Loan Fund. It had two other ships on order for nearly £17m, using a loan from Santander bank. But it ran into cash flow problems early this year as the oil price fell. Administrators at PwC said the daily spot price for hiring offshore vessels dropped from £18,000 to only £3,000. Prices reflected oil production firms cutting costs and exploration. The administrators transferred Fletcher Shipping assets to a new company, FS Shipping, in a so-called 'pre-pack' deal. This was financed with £18m, raised through Grovepoint Capital. The main assets of Fletcher Shipping, founded in 2007, were the FS Pegasus, FS Aquarius, FS Pisces and FS Taurus. The pre-pack deal means the operations continue uninterrupted, while shareholders lose out and creditors only recover some of their lending to the collapsed firm. According to administrators, the transaction had no employment impact, as the vessels crews were contract staff working for other firms. Keith Fletcher, founder of Fletcher Shipping, said: \\"It is testament to the strong reputation of the crews and personnel at Fletcher Shipping that we have secured the confidence of new investors who have helped us recapitalise our business. \\"We have worked hard to keep our fleet working throughout the recent downturn in the North Sea - a downturn which has affected the vessel market more harshly than I have witnessed in 30 years of business. The Scottish Loan Fund is part of the Scottish Investment Bank, which is the investing arm of Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish government's economic development agency. The loan fund is run by Maven Capital to meet gaps in the market for funding company growth. Fletcher Shipping had a £5m investment from public funds over 2012 and 2013, as part of a consortium with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Maven Capital client funds. At the time of announcing the funding package, the head of the Scottish Investment Bank, Kerry Sharp, said: \\"Fletcher Shipping is exactly the kind of company the Scottish Loan Fund was established to support.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -54*c - 24 = -83*c + 37*c for c.","completion":"The equation given is -54c - 24 = -83c + 37c. We begin to solve for 'c' in a step-by-step way as follows: First, simplify the equation. On the right side of the equation, there are two 'c' terms that could be combined (-83c and 37c). Doing this gives: -54c - 24 = (-83c + 37c) which simplifies to: -54c - 24 = -46c. The next step is to isolate 'c' (the variable we're solving for) on one side of the equation. By doing this, we can find what 'c' should equal. We can do this by adding 46c to both sides of the equation to eliminate -46c from the right: -54c + 46c - 24 = -46c + 46c which simplifies to: -8c - 24 = 0. Again to isolate 'c', add 24 to both sides of the equation: -8c = 24. Finally, to get 'c' alone, we divide each side by -8: c = 24 / -8. And that will bring us to the final answer: c = -3. So, the solution to the equation -54c - 24 = -83c + 37c is c = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What has happened to ice if it is not ice any more? Possible A: vaporate, cool off, form crystals, melt, keep things cold Why is \\"melt\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Melt\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the given question because when ice loses its solid form and is no longer considered ice, it typically undergoes a process called melting. Melting is a phase transition in which a substance, in this case ice, changes from its solid state to its liquid state, which is water. This process typically occurs due to an increase in temperature, resulting in the breaking of intermolecular bonds that hold the ice in its solid structure. Analyzing the other possible answers: - Vaporate: This term is incorrect and probably refers to \\"evaporate.\\" Evaporation is the process where a substance changes from its liquid state to its gaseous state (e.g., water turning into water vapor). Since the question refers to \\"ice,\\" which is a solid, evaporation is not the right answer in this context. - Cool off: Cooling off means to decrease in temperature. For ice (solid-state of water) to not be ice anymore, it needs to gain temperature and change phase, not lose it. So, this is not the correct answer. - Form crystals: Ice itself is a crystalline solid where the water molecules are arranged in a regular pattern. Ice already has a crystal structure, so forming crystals doesn't explain why it's not ice anymore. Hence, this answer is not aligned with the common-sense understanding of the situation. - Keep things cold: This option refers to a property or function of ice, rather than a transformation of it. Keeping things cold does not explain what has happened to the ice itself. Thus, \\"melt\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense because it directly reflects the phase transition process that happens when ice is no longer ice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abu Bakr as-Siddiq 'Abdallah bin Abi Quhafah (Arabic: 'bw bkr lSdyq \`bd llh bn 'by qHf@; c. 573 CE - 22 August 634 CE), popularly known as Abu Bakr ('bw bkr), was a senior companion (Sahabi) and--through his daughter Aisha--the father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Abu Bakr became the first openly declared Muslim outside Muhammad's family. Abu Bakr served as a trusted advisor to Muhammad. Abu Bakr attended the event of Ghadir Khumm, which took place a few months before Muhammad passed away. According to both Shia and Sunni sources, he was among the many who pledged allegiance to Ali at the event. In Medina, after the Farewell Pilgrimage and the event of Ghadir Khumm, Muhammad ordered an army under the command of Usama bin Zayd. He commanded all the companions, except for his family, to go with Usama to Syria to avenge the Muslims' defeat at the Battle of Mu'tah. Muhammad gave Usama the banner of Islam on the 18th day of the Islamic month of Safar in the year 11 A.H. Abu Bakr and Umar were among those that Muhammad commanded to join Usama's army. However, Abu Bakr and Umar resisted going under the command of Usama because they thought that he, who was 18 or 20 at the time, was too young to lead an army, despite Muhammad's teachings that age and standing in society did not necessarily correspond to being a good general. In response to these worries, the Prophet said: \\"O Arabs! You are miserable because I have appointed Usama as your general, and you are raising questions if he is qualified to lead you in war. I know you are the same people who had raised the same question about his father. By God, Usama is qualified to be your general just as his father was qualified to be a general. Now obey his orders and go.\\" Whenever Muhammad felt any relief from his fatal sickness, he would inquire as to whether Usama's army had left for Syria yet, and would continue urging his companions to leave for Syria. Muhammad even said, \\"Usama's army must leave at once. May Allah curse those men who do not go with him.\\" However, while a few companions were ready to join Usama's army, many other companions, including Abu Bakr and Umar, disobeyed Muhammad's orders. It is also noted that this was the only battle expedition where Muhammad urged his companions to go the battle no matter what; for other battles, if someone was unable to go to the fight, Muhammad would let them stay at home.

If the time is convenient for you, surely accept their invitation. But if you're busy, don't be afraid to _ the invitation, perhaps suggesting a time that would be better. Your host won't be shamed. Invitations are usually sent in person or over the telephone. The main exception is for some formal occasions, in which case a written invitation will be mailed. You would normally receive a written invitation to a wedding . For a casual dinner invitation, don't arrive more than 5 minutes early, because your host may still be preparing for your visit. Arriving more than 10 minutes late is considered rude if very few people were invited. If many people were invited, it's OK to arrive a little late, even as much as half an hour late. For example, it's OK to arrive late for a party, for a potluck dinner or for a social gathering inviting a large group of people. If you're invited for dinner, it's proper to bring the host a bottle of wine, a gift basket of fruit, a box of candy , or a bouquet of flowers.

Please briefly summarize this news article: AP case reflects larger government assault on press and privacy The Justice Department’s secret seizure of Associated Press reporters’ private telephone records is a slap in the face to a free press — and a free people. But it’s part of both a larger assault on the traditional function of the media by the Obama administration, as well as a broader government intrusion into the privacy of U.S. citizens. Under Obama, the government has pursued six cases against individuals suspected of handing over classified information, more than under all previous presidents combined, as the Associated Press pointed out. Meanwhile, disturbing news about the government’s ability and willingness to use electronic surveillance on Americans has continued to mount. It adds up to a chilling effect on citizens, journalists and potential whistleblowers, who rightly now must think twice about offering information concerning government misdeeds or secrets. That comes at an incredibly high cost for society. Whatever you think of the modern press — and I’ve got plenty of problems with it myself — it serves a critical function in bringing government wrongdoing out into the open. It holds officials, police and the military accountable for their actions in a way that nothing else can. It’s in our national interest to protect the media’s use of confidential sources, because too often people can only be honest and open about such matters under the cloak of anonymity. The Justice Department hasn’t provided details about its investigation that ensnared the Associated Press, but it appears to be related to a story the news wire published in May 2012 revealing the Central Intelligence Agency successfully thwarted an al-Qaida plot to blow up a United States-bound airliner. The Justice Department seems to have obtained records of outgoing calls for the work, personal and cell phone numbers of a handful of Associated Press reporters, including the ones involved in that story. The records also included calls coming from the general AP office numbers in several cities. So far, it doesn’t seem the conversations themselves were monitored. The Justice Department’s own rules require that subpoenas for the telephone records of journalists be as narrowly drawn as possible, and sought only after all other possibilities for finding the information it’s seeking are exhausted. The first clearly didn’t happen; the details concerning the second part are still unclear. “There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters,” wrote Associated Press Chief Executive Gary Pruitt in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. “These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the news gathering activities undertaken by the A.P. during a two-month period, provide a road map to A.P.’s news gathering operations, and disclose information about A.P.’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.” Even if you’re not outraged by the government’s latest intrusion into the privacy of the press, consider its ongoing intrusions into your own. In the years since the terrorist attack of 9/11, the United States has edged ever closer to a surveillance state, as the National Security Agency engaged in warrantless wiretapping and eavesdropped in secret rooms at the switching centers of AT&T and others. Using open records requests, the ACLU last year found that police departments routinely track personal cell phones, often without warrants. A subsequent congressional inquiry found that cellular carriers responded to at least 1.3 million such requests for subscriber records last year, a notable increase based on carriers that provided figures from earlier years. Also in 2012, Wired reported that the NSA is building a massive, 2 billion data center in Utah to mine and analyze vast amounts of personal data and communications crisscrossing the Internet. “Flowing through its servers and routers and stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private e-mails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails — parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital ‘pocket litter,’ ” the magazine reported. “It is, in some measure, the realization of the ‘total information awareness’ program created during the first term of the Bush administration — an effort that was killed by Congress in 2003 after it caused an outcry over its potential for invading Americans’ privacy.” A former FBI counterterrorism agent divulged even more shocking information earlier this month. Tim Clemente was asked in a CNN interview whether the government could review earlier telephone conversations between the late Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his widow, Katherine Russell, to determine if she had any involvement in the crime. “There is a way,” he said. “We certainly have ways in national security investigations to find out exactly what was said in that conversation. It’s not necessarily something that the FBI is going to want to present in court, but it may help lead the investigation.” “All of that stuff,” he continued after the next question, “is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not.” That seems to suggest that the government can record or access recordings all of our phone calls. It sounds far-fetched; it sounds downright Orwellian. But I, for one, would certainly like to know if it’s true. That strikes me as a far bigger crime — and something much more worthy of an aggressive investigation — than a phone call between a government staffer and a reporter.

Drake began recording his debut album Five Leaves Left later in 1968, with Boyd as producer. Drake skipped lectures to travel by train to the sessions in Sound Techniques studio, London. Inspired by John Simon's production of Leonard Cohen's album Songs of Leonard Cohen, Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, \\"with no shiny pop reverb\\". He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, \\"without overwhelming ... or sounding cheesy\\". To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London folk rock scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson (no relation). To provide string arrangements, Boyd already had in mind Richard A. Hewson. Initial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention's production of their Unhalfbricking album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of George Martin's approach of \\"using the studio as an instrument\\", while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann has observed that Drake appears \\"tight and anxious\\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation. Both were unhappy with Hewson's contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs. Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement. Though Boyd was sceptical about taking on an inexperienced amateur music student, he was impressed by Drake's uncharacteristic assertiveness, and agreed to a trial. Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs.

Entailment in the context of natural language processing and linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other, regardless of the specific context. In this case, the premise \\"But he got no pleasure from it\\" has an implication that the individual being referred to found no satisfaction, enjoyment, or positive emotional value from an activity, event, or thing. The hypothesis \\"He didn't find any pleasure in it\\" is simply a rephrase of the same idea, indicating that the same person found the event, object, or situation to be devoid of pleasurable qualities. Both sentences express the same idea using different syntactical structures. The premise entails the hypothesis because if it is true that he had no pleasure, then it follows that he didn't find any pleasure. In both cases, pleasure is lacking in the situation or object being referred to.

Please answer the following question: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has unveiled a far-reaching list of demands for any new nuclear deal with Iran, and threatened economy-crushing sanctions if Tehran does not change its behavior. The 12-point list of demands came in a Monday speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation that laid out the Trump administration's strategy after pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement earlier this month. Under any new deal, Pompeo insisted, Iran must indefinitely abandon nuclear weapons work and provide United Nations inspectors access to sites anywhere in the country.He said Tehran must also end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and stop its \\"destabilizing activities\\" across the Middle East. If Iran does not change course, the U.S. \\"will apply unprecedented financial pressure,\\" Pompeo warned. \\"These will be the strongest sanctions in history by the time we are done,\\" said Pompeo. \\"The [Iranian] regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years. After our sanctions come into full force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive.\\" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani dismissed the threats. \\"Who are you to decide for Iran and the world?\\" Rouhani said in a statement published by Iranian state media on Monday. \\"The world today does not accept that the United States decides for the world. Countries have their independence.\\" The Trump administration has vowed to reimpose sanctions that were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement, which was signed between Iran, the United States, and several European countries, as well as Russia and China. Washington has also imposed additional sanctions. European countries are holding talks with Iran to try to salvage the deal. But it's not clear whether the effort can succeed.

Dieter Bohlen, Germany's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like \\"You're my heart, you're my soul\\" felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less a fuzzy image of it. He didn't deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself. No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital. However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of \\"American Idol\\" - especially his unforgettable comments. This should be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the mentioned \\"Idol\\" TV show called \\"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\\" (abbreviated DSDS) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book. The result is \\"Dieter - der Film\\" I have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely. None of the gags really hits the point. Naddel's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Verona's voice should have done that more. Obvious, childish, predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes. The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen's sloppy idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all. It's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release. The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success. With the \\"friendly\\" help of Germany's biggest yellow press newspaper \\"BILD\\" and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show \\"Wetten dass... ?\\" is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television - unfortunately.

Now, these authorities are stripped of justice,\\" a protester tells the BBC. A state of emergency could involve the use of the army, the BBC notes. Meanwhile, protests have extended into areas that had been bastions of support for President Viktor Yanukovich, the New York Times reports. The latest demonstrations follow the president's offer to make opposition leaders Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Vitali Klitschko prime minister and deputy PM; they turned down the positions, with the Times noting that they share few beliefs outside of their stance against Yanukovich. Yesterday, thousands gathered in cities like Odessa, Zaporizhzhya, and Dnipropetrovsk; arrests and injuries were reported amid clashes with police. Four protesters were killed last week, and their funerals drew thousands. Expand this summary.","completion":"Ukraine protesters, who largely back away from occupying the Justice Ministry building, did so after Ukraine's Justice Minister, Olena Lukash, threatened to call a state of emergency if the occupation continued. This occupation included barricading the building using bags of snow as a resistance technique. Reportedly, about 30 protesters still lingered in the premises, despite the warning. An unnamed protester claims that the seizure of the Ministry of Justice symbolizes an act of uprising by the people and strips the current authorities of justice. The significance of declaring a state of emergency is the potential involvement of the nation's armed forces. The protests in Ukraine have extended beyond the usual areas into regions that have been strongholds of support for President Viktor Yanukovich, as reported by the New York Times. One of the reasons for the latest round of demonstrations is the rejection of the President's offer to make opposition leaders, Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Vitali Klitschko, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister respectively. Despite their shared opposition to Yanukovich, the two leaders reportedly hold very few common beliefs; hence, they turned down the positions offered. In light of the escalation and expansion of the Ukraine protests, numerous cities such as Odessa, Zaporizhzhya, and Dnipropetrovsk have become hotspots for thousands of demonstrators. These events have witnessed clashes with the police, resulting in arrests and injuries. Last week, the situation turned deadly when four protesters were killed. Their funerals drew large crowds, escalating the tensions between the demonstrators and the government. The ongoing protests in Ukraine signify the fundamental disagreements and dissatisfaction of large segments of the population with the current government, led by President Viktor Yanukovich.

Which of the following was his average speed for this 2 hr period?","completion":"Okay, let's break it down step by step: 1. First, we need to find out how many 3-minute sections are in a 2-hour period. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have 2 hours x 60 minutes = 120 minutes. 2. Now we divide the total minutes (120) by the 3-minute sections, which will give us 120 minutes ÷ 3 minutes = 40 sections. 3. We know that Tobias passes a 1 km marker in every 3-minute section, and he completed 40 sections. So, he covered 40 sections x 1 km = 40 km in total. 4. Finally, we need to find out his average speed. To do this, we will divide the total distance (40 km) by the total time (2 hours). So, 40 km ÷ 2 hours = 20 km per hour.

Joshua, whose next test is against American Kevin Johnson on January 31, insisted he wants a significant step up. And after watching Fury dominate Chisora last weekend, he echoed his promoter Eddie Hearn’s calls for a high-profile domestic dust-up next year. Scroll down to watch Anthony Joshua square off with Kevin Johnson. Anthony Joshua (right) squares up to Kevin Johnson ahead of their heavyweight clash on January 31. Joshua will face the toughest test of his career against Johnson when they meet at the O2 in the new year. ‘I went to see Fury beat Chisora but there wasn’t much to see,’ Joshua said. ‘You can’t write off either but from an entertainment point it was poor. ‘But it’s done me good because the guys who went will say, “who’s next on the agenda?”. ‘I’m confident in my own ability that I could cause an upset and beat those guys. ‘But if I was to line them all up, David Haye is the one I would like to fight. He’s the best and when you fight the best it brings the best out in you. I need to step up, which is what we’re doing. I think we’re going to take some risky fights and I’m sure I’ll overcome them.’ Before that, however, Joshua must navigate a way past Johnson, who has never been stopped in his 36-fight career. He unsuccessfully challenged Vitali Klitschko for the world title in 2009 and has taken both Chisora and Fury the 12-round distance. Johnson took Vitali Klitschko the distance in their world title fight in 2009 and have never been stopped. But Joshua said: ‘Just because he’s never been stopped does not mean he’s a winner, it just means he goes in to survive. It should be a tough sparring session. If I can stop him, I’ve ticked a box and I move on. I’m confident I can. ‘I’ll train over Christmas; if I want to beat him I have to make the sacrifice. I don’t think he’ll train over Christmas or New Year. If I get the stoppage it’ll be because I’ve done the extra bits, if I don’t you know I’ll have been out raving!’ On a visit to London on Wednesday, Johnson challenged his younger opponent to a wager. He said: ‘I want to make an agreement. If Anthony knocks me out I’ll donate 50 per cent of my purse to one of his charities. And if he gets knocked out, he gives 50 per cent to my charity. Joshua is confident he would beat both Tyson Fury (left) and Dereck Chisora next year. Joshua also wants to fight David Haye (right) who has been out of action since beating Chisora in 2012. ‘There’s going to be a knockout so let’s up the ante.’ But Joshua said: ‘I do my charity work but I’ve got a professional job to do. I’ve seen boxers throw cash about but I want to leave that to one side.’ Before he returns to his gym in London, however, Joshua will spend 10 days in Cuba. He said: ‘I’m taking my gumshield to see if I can get some sparring. What an experience that would be. ‘I’ll start ticking over for this fight, get some sun on my back and some runs on the beach. Then I’ll come back feeling refreshed.’","completion":"1. Anthony Joshua expresses confidence in defeating Tyson Fury, Dereck Chisora, and former world champion David Haye. 2.

The original text provided is written using capital letters for the beginning of each noun. Transforming the passage into lowercase affects not only the beginning of the sentence, but also all the other capitalized words. By converting the passage into lowercase, it creates a sense of uniformity throughout the sentence, resulting in easier readability. The passage itself describes the fleeting nature of positions such as royalty and military leadership. By comparing these high-ranking figures to locusts and grasshoppers in a metaphorical sense, the text conveys the idea that although these individuals have significant influence, their power is temporary and often solely dependent on external factors. In this case, the external factor is the climate in which they inhabit - with the cold day representing a period of stability where they remain safely in their positions. However, once the sun arises, it disrupts this sense of security, forcing the locusts and grasshoppers to abandon their territory. The phrase \\"and their place is not known where they are\\" emphasizes the uncertainty and instability faced by these leaders. In a broader context, this can signify the transient nature of power and control in society, reflecting the idea that even seemingly invincible figures may eventually lose their status or influence due to altering circumstances. This theme is highly relevant in various contexts, from historical events to contemporary politics, reminding readers of the fickleness of power and the inevitable shifts that occur within societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He proposes; she accepts (\\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \\"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty. She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband.

Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: He was morally upright and knew he was strong, so who should he protect? Possible A: batman, diluted, fragile, regular, weak Why is \\"weak\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Weak\\" as an answer is aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the context and the essence of the question. Human common sense is a set of basic understanding and reasoning skills that are intuitive and shared among humans. It allows people to make decisions and judgments based on their experiences, knowledge, and perceptions of the world. In the given question, we are presented with the case of a morally upright individual who is aware of their strength. The natural thought process, according to human common sense, would be that they should use their strength to benefit and protect those who are in need or may be vulnerable. The principle of protecting the weak follows the moral standards and principles empathized by a majority of societies and cultures around the world. Let's evaluate the other possible answers in relation to human common sense: 1. Batman: Choosing Batman doesn't align with human common sense because Batman is a fictional character and is known to be a skilled and powerful superhero who is dedicated to protecting others. A morally upright and strong individual would not need to protect someone who is already capable of protecting themselves and others. 2. Diluted: This answer doesn't make sense in the context of the question, as \\"diluted\\" usually refers to reducing the concentration of a substance or quality. It does not align with human common sense as it is not a relevant term to describe whom someone should protect. 3. Fragile: Although \\"fragile\\" could also be a plausible choice because it implies the consideration of protecting vulnerable individuals, it does not convey the same directness and breadth that \\"weak\\" does. Fragile more specifically refers to physical frailty or delicacy, while \\"weak\\" can encompass physical, emotional, or situational vulnerabilities. Thus, \\"weak\\" aligns more closely with human common sense in this context. 4. Regular: This answer doesn't align with human common sense, as \\"regular\\" implies that the person is neither particularly vulnerable nor particularly strong. A morally upright and strong individual would prioritize protecting those in greater need or more susceptible to harm, rather than someone who can manage on their own. In conclusion, the answer \\"weak\\" aligns with human common sense because it directly addresses the need for a morally upright and strong individual to protect those who are vulnerable or unable to protect themselves, which is a core moral principle shared by many societies. The other answer choices either do not correlate with the context of the question or do not follow the same intuitive reasoning based on the moral responsibility of a strong person to protect the vulnerable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Against the supposition that forest fires in Alaska, Canada and Siberia warm the climate, scientists have discovered that cooling may occur in areas where burnt trees allow more snow to mirror more sunlight into space. This finding suggests that taking steps to prevent northern forest fires to limit the release of greenhouse gases may warm the climate in northern regions. Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling. This is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat. Scientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling. \\"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature. Typically, fire in northern regions occurs in the same area every 80 to 150 years. Scientists, however, found that when fire occurs more frequently, more radiation is lost from the earth and cooling results. Specifically, they determined when...

While the statement \\"they have thick fur\\" is true for many mammals, it is not an accurate answer to the question. The term \\"thick fur\\" describes the density of hair on a mammal's body; it does not identify the unique fiber itself. Something that can be auburn – a reddish-brown color – can be associated with hair found on mammals, but this description still does not directly answer the question about the specific fiber unique to mammals. Auburn is just a color, and hair color itself is not unique to mammals. The unique fiber found only in mammals is keratin, which is the structural protein that makes up hair, fur, nails, claws, horns, hooves, and other parts of mammals' bodies. It is only present in mammals and distinguishes them from other animals. Keratin is responsible for the strength, toughness, and durability of these structures. In conclusion, \\"they have thick fur\\" and \\"something that can be auburn\\" are related to the presence of hair on mammals, but they do not directly address the question that asks for the unique fiber found only in mammals.

Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate? Demetrious is conducting chemical reactions for his community college chemistry laboratory course. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide. Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A clever child from a loving middle class home, William Cornick was the most unlikely perpetrator of a crime that would shock Britain. As the 16-year-old was sentenced to life in prison after becoming the first pupil to kill a teacher in a British classroom, friends said they were stunned by his senseless stabbing of his teacher Ann Maguire. To the teacher in charge of his year he was ‘a delightful pupil who always gave his best’. Fellow pupils at Corpus Christi Catholic College said he was a just a ‘typical lad’ who rarely misbehaved. Scroll down for video. Killer: William Cornick was 15 years old when he stabbed his teacher Ann Maguire, 61, to death, as she taught a class at Corpus Christi Catholic College, in Leeds, in April. ‘He was probably the most intelligent person I knew,’ said Tom Smith, a former student. ‘But he was really quiet and kept himself to himself. He had his friends, but he wasn’t with them all the time. ‘You can look at someone and say “I don’t think they could do anything like that”. I’m still shocked. I didn’t think that in a school like Corpus such a thing could happen.’ Another unnamed student said: ‘He was like any other lad my age; he wasn’t a naughty kid. He was a typical, nice lad. It seems surreal how it’s changed.’ Cornick was no youth from a sink estate left to his own devices by a dysfunctional family. His mother Michelle, 48, is a human resources manager, who was said to be devoted to the teenager and his 19-year-old brother Zack, who is in a rock band. Stable life: Far from being having an unhappy upbringing, Cornick, depicted in a court sketch, comes from a middleclass background and his parents have been described as loving and supportive. Their father Ian is a 50-year-old council executive who lives with his partner and their young child in an upmarket village near Leeds. Although his parents divorced a decade ago, Cornick seemed to enjoy a happy home life. The life sentence handed down to the schoolboy who murdered a teacher was today condemned as too harsh by youth justice campaigners. Former magistrate Penelope Gibbs, who chairs the Standing Committee for Youth Justice umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said the sentence was too long. She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘We are out of line with the whole of western Europe. There are no other countries within Western Europe which give children - and this boy is seen as a child under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is in the youth justice system - who would give children a life sentence.’ Ms Gibbs accepted that the sentence had to serve as a punishment, but said there was ‘no evidence’ for the 20-year minimum tariff. ‘Punishment is also incredibly important, particularly for the victims and families, but the fact is, how many years do we need for punishment? We have given him a sentence which is more than his own lifetime,’ she said. ‘He was 15 when he did this crime and we would say that you don't need that long to punish. What is crucial is that when he is released he is assessed as no longer being of danger to himself and others and thus we would all be safer. 'But there is no evidence that that takes 20 years and we've looked and we think that this is the longest sentence given to a child in at least 10 years. I'm not going to tell you exactly what the right sentence would have been, but 20 years and a life sentence is too long.’ Paul Greaney, prosecuting, said there was nothing to indicate to the boy’s parents or teachers that he was capable of homicidal violence. He added that Mr and Mrs Cornick are ‘decent and responsible parents’ who have co- operated fully with the police. Mr Justice Coulson said Mr and Mrs Cornick were ‘responsible and caring parents and his family life was marked by love and support’. Cornick had never been in any trouble with the police and was one of the brightest students at Corpus Christi, passing five GCSE exams a year early. He was regarded as ‘amicable, enthusiastic and conscientious’ at school, with a 100 per cent attendance record. In the four years before the killing, five incidents of misbehaviour were recorded – two minor. Significantly, the final three took place two months before the murder and concerned his hatred of Mrs Maguire and dislike of Spanish lessons. But closer inspection of Cornick’s internet use revealed a different side to his apparently respectable image. As one pupil said: ‘The Grim Reaper was the first thing you saw on his [Facebook] page. ‘That corrected everyone’s opinion. [I thought] what the hell has happened, something has definitely gone wrong.’ Friends had begun to regard him as a ‘loner and weirdo’ and ‘disturbing’ aspects of his personality became apparent. He spoke openly about murdering his teacher, messaging a friend on Facebook about brutally killing her and spending the rest of his life in jail. He had numerous images of knives on his mobile phone. He also had a keen interest in ultra-violent video games, including Dark Souls II, in which players hack zombies to pieces. Players devour the souls of their fallen enemies to the sound of cries of agony. Disturbing images include a character made up of hundreds of human corpses. It was voted one of the ten Most Violent Video Games of 2014. One pupil recalled Cornick saying disgusting things at a party. He said: ‘He was saying twisted stuff like “imagine jumping on a pregnant woman and seeing the baby come out”, and saying horrible stuff about cancer and stuff like that. Loss: Ann Maguire's family, husband Don and daughters Emma and Kerry, stand outside Leeds Crown Court as a statement is read after the sentencing. ‘He was just saying it in conversation. He thought it was normal but it’s not. He wasn’t normal in the head.’ But for a long time Cornick had been able to hide his ‘anger’ from others by maintaining an appearance of normality. From game to real life: Will Cornick's Facebook photograph shows him wearing a gamer tshirt. The teenager later confessed to a psychiatrist that the killing had been on his mind for three years, and one expert said he had engaged in a ‘considerable amount of fantasy’ about killing Mrs Maguire. Psychiatrists decided he suffered from a personality disorder with psychopathic tendencies. It was of course too late, but the danger this previously anonymous teenager poses has now been revealed to all. John Kent, a forensic psychiatrist, said Cornick ‘presents a risk of serious harm to the public and that this risk is present for the foreseeable future’. Mr Greaney told Leeds Crown Court: ‘One of the most disturbing aspects of an extremely disturbing case is that [Cornick] not only lacks remorse but is proud of what he did in killing Mrs Maguire.’ The QC said Cornick told a psychiatrist: ‘I wasn’t in shock, I was happy. I had a sense of pride. I still do.’ He added that Cornick’s parents were ‘at a loss’ to understand how their son could have committed such a crime. Absolved of any blame by both police and the judge, Mr and Mrs Cornick sat behind their son in the court room dock as details of his chilling lack of remorse were revealed. Gudrun Wroot, who worked with Mrs Cornick at a catalogue publisher, said: ‘It is awful for the family of the woman who has been killed but it is also traumatic for the family of the boy. Mothers blame themselves but she can’t … It is just terrible. But really she is a nice person and a very caring mother.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"William Cornick, a 16-year-old boy, was sentenced to life in prison for killing his teacher, Ann Maguire, in a British classroom.

Family members say Nykea Aldridge, 32, had recently relocated to the area on the city's South Side, the AP reports. Chicago police say she was killed Friday when two males walked up and fired shots at a third man but hit Aldridge in the head and arm. She wasn't the intended target, police say. Family members are caring for the baby, who wasn't hurt. Police said Friday evening that they are questioning witnesses in the shooting but have no suspects in custody. Wade, a Chicago native who signed with the Chicago Bulls in July after 13 years with the Miami Heat, tweeted: \\"My cousin was killed today in Chicago. Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal. #EnoughIsEnough.\\" Just a day earlier, Wade had participated via satellite in a town hall meeting in Chicago on gun violence hosted by ESPN, along with his mother, pastor Jolinda Wade. Outside the emergency room where Aldridge was pronounced dead Friday, Jolinda Wade said she participated in the town hall meeting on gun violence Thursday, \\"never knowing that the next day we would be the ones that would actually be living and experiencing it.\\" (At the ESPY Awards last month, Wade and other NBA stars pleaded for an end to gun violence.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Nykea Aldridge, a 32-year-old cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade, was tragically shot and killed in Chicago on Friday, August 26, 2016. Aldridge, a mother of four, was pushing her baby in a stroller near a school in the South Side area of the city and planned to register her children there. She had only recently relocated to the neighborhood. The shocking incident occurred when two males approached and opened fire at a third individual, inadvertently striking Aldridge in the head and arm. According to the police, she was not the intended target of the gunmen. Her baby was fortunately unharmed during the shooting, and family members have since taken the child into their care. The police were actively questioning witnesses in the aftermath of the shooting, but no suspects had been apprehended at the time. Dwyane Wade, a Chicago native who had just signed with the Chicago Bulls in July after a 13-year-stint with the Miami Heat, expressed his heartbreak and outrage via Twitter: \\"My cousin was killed today in Chicago. Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal. #EnoughIsEnough.\\" The irony of the situation was that just one day before his cousin's tragic death, Dwyane Wade had participated via satellite in a town hall meeting on gun violence hosted by ESPN in Chicago, alongside his mother, Pastor Jolinda Wade. The startling coincidence was not lost on Jolinda, as she remarked, \\"never knowing that the next day we would be the ones that would actually be living and experiencing it.\\" It is important to note that Dwyane Wade, as well as other NBA stars, has been an advocate for putting an end to gun violence, as evidenced by their impassioned plea at the ESPY Awards that took place the previous month. The tragic death of Nykea Aldridge is indicative of the wave of senseless gun violence that has gripped the city of Chicago. Her story and the stories of countless others who have lost their lives to random, brutal acts of violence stand as a stark reminder of the urgent need to address this issue proactively. Gun control measures, community initiatives, and sustained efforts to promote peaceful resolution of conflicts are all vital components of a comprehensive strategy to curb gun violence in Chicago and other cities across the United States. The loss of Aldridge and countless others must ignite an unwavering commitment to end the scourge of gun violence that continues to devastate families and communities across the nation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the lungs are working properly happens, how will it affect \\"LESS oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\".

If the lungs are working properly, they will efficiently take in air and transport it to the alveoli. From there, an effective exchange of oxygen to the blood capillaries occurs. This oxygen is then carried by red blood cells and distributed throughout the body. However, if the perturbation supposes \\"LESS oxygen being brought to the body's cells,\\" then one or more components of this process must be impaired. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as an issue with the heme protein not being able to bind effectively with the oxygen, the blood circulation being slow, or the body's cells not receiving or utilizing the oxygen efficiently. It's worth noting that even though the lungs are properly functioning in this perturbation, the distribution and use of oxygen is a systemic process. Thus, disruptions elsewhere in the system outside of the lungs could still result in less oxygen being delivered to the body's cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"i haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I've been doing it a lot still.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"I haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down\\", we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"I've been doing it a lot still\\" is true. To understand why, we must examine the meaning and implications of both statements. The given premise suggests that the speaker has been engaged in a certain activity at a lesser frequency since conditions have become calmer or more settled. In this context, \\"it\\" refers to the activity in question, and \\"calmed down\\" implies that previously the situation was not calm – it might have been more intense, chaotic, or it required more engagement from the speaker. As a result, the speaker reduced their involvement in that activity due to the changed state of affairs. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"I've been doing it a lot still\\" implies that the speaker is maintaining a high level of engagement in the activity, regardless of any changes in the external situation. It suggests continuity and persistent involvement, which directly contradicts the given premise. To analyze these statements from a logical perspective, let's assign some symbolic terms to each statement: 1. Premise: \\"I haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down.\\" - Let A represent engaging in the activity - Let B represent the calmed-down situation - This premise can be symbolically expressed as: If B, then less A 2. Hypothesis: \\"I've been doing it a lot still.\\" - Let C represent engaging in the activity a lot - This hypothesis can be symbolically expressed as: C Based on the premise A (If B, then less A) and the hypothesis C, there is a clear inconsistency between the two statements. The premise proposes that when the situation is calmer, there is less engagement in the activity, while the hypothesis contends that the speaker is still highly involved in the activity. In conclusion, we cannot accept the hypothesis \\"I've been doing it a lot still\\" as true, based on the given premise. The two statements are contradictory, and the premise directly challenges the validity of the hypothesis. It would be better to investigate further or gather more information to understand the speaker's actual level of engagement in the activity during the calmer situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step in the process described would be the production of carbon dioxide by engines. To elaborate, engines, specifically internal combustion engines, are widely used in various applications such as automobiles, generators, and industrial equipment. These engines burn fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and natural gas to generate mechanical power. During the combustion of these fuels, chemical reactions occur, which result in the conversion of the chemical energy stored in the fossil fuels into mechanical and heat energy. One of the byproducts of this energy conversion process is carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it contributes to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process through which certain gases trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, thereby maintaining the planet's temperature at a level suitable for sustaining life. However, when the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases significantly, it can cause more heat to be retained, resulting in global warming, which is an increase in the Earth's surface temperature over time. As the question also mentioned other processes, such as living things producing waste, decomposition of waste, and evaporation of water, these all contribute to the overall greenhouse effect as well. For instance, waste produced by living organisms can take various forms, including fecal matter and dead organisms. Decomposition of this organic waste by microorganisms leads to the production of another potent greenhouse gas, methane (CH4). Similarly, the evaporation of water is a natural process that plays a crucial role in the Earth's water cycle. Water molecules absorb energy from sunlight or heat sources and transform from the liquid state to the gaseous state, resulting in water vapor. Water vapor is also a greenhouse gas since it can absorb and retain heat in the Earth's atmosphere. In conclusion, the first step of the process described is the production of carbon dioxide by engines through the combustion of fossil fuels. This process, along with the other natural processes mentioned (such as waste decomposition and water evaporation), contributes to the greenhouse effect and ultimately impacts the Earth's climate. Understanding the individual steps and interconnections among them is essential for managing and reducing the adverse effects of human activities on the climate and the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink. His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey. At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior. Junior threatens to kill Denton, enraged that Vassey would see him while avoiding his own son.

Here is an article: The record-breaking polar air that has made the Midwestern U.S. shiver over the past few days spread to the East and South on Tuesday, setting record low temperatures from Boston and New York to Atlanta, Birmingham, Nashville and Little Rock — places where many people don't know the first thing about extreme cold. The morning weather map for the eastern half of the U.S. looked like an algebra worksheet: lots of small, negative numbers. In fact, the Midwest and the East were colder than much of Antarctica. The big chill started in the Midwest over the weekend, and by Tuesday, it covered about half of the country. In New York City, the high was expected to be -12 C; in Boston, around -8 C. The polar vortex refers to winds that whip around the polar ice cap, trapping Earth's coldest temperatures there. Its deterioration with global warming, however, can send arctic weather south into areas as far away as the southern U.S. and Europe, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists. \\"When the polar vortex … breaks down, this allows cold air to spill south, affecting the eastern United States and other regions,\\" says NOAA's Dr. James Overland. \\"This can result in a warmer-than-average arctic region and colder temperatures that may include severe winter weather events on the North American and European continents.\\" Across the South, records were shattered like icicles. Birmingham, Alabama, dipped to a low of -14 C), breaking the record of -11.7 C set in 1970. Atlanta saw a record low of -14.5 C. Nashville, Tennessee, got down to -16.7 C, and Little Rock, Arkansas, fell to -13 C. It was just -17 C at Washington Dulles International airport, eclipsing the 1988 mark of -13 C. The deep freeze dragged on in the Midwest as well, with the thermometer reaching -24 C overnight in the Chicago area and -25.5 C in suburban St. Louis. More than 500 Amtrak passengers were stranded overnight on three Chicago-bound trains that were stopped by blowing and drifting snow in Illinois. Food ran low, but the heat stayed on. The worst should be over in the next day or two. Warmer weather — at least, near or above freezing — is in the forecast for much of the stricken part of the country. On Tuesday, many schools and day care centres across the eastern half of the U.S. were closed so that youngsters wouldn't be exposed to the dangerous cold. Officials opened shelters for the homeless and anyone else who needed a warm place. With the bitter cold slowing baggage handling and aircraft refuelling, airlines cancelled more than 2,000 flights in the U.S., bringing the four-day total to more than 11,000. In New Orleans, which reported a low of -3 C, hardware stores ran out of pipe insulation. A pipe burst in an Atlanta suburb and a main road quickly froze over. In downtown Atlanta, a Ferris wheel near Centennial Olympic Park that opened over the summer to give riders a bird's eye view of the city closed because it was too cold. The Hurricanes have been shut down by a blizzard. The NHL has postponed the game scheduled for Tuesday night in Buffalo between the Sabres and Carolina because of a snowstorm in western New York. A makeup date has not been determined. The postponement comes with Buffalo dealing with a wintry blast of frigid temperatures, heavy winds and blinding snow that has forced the closure of most major roadways. Farther south in Pensacola, Florida, a Gulf Coast city better known for its white sand beaches than frost, streets normally filled with joggers, bikers and people walking dogs were deserted early Tuesday. A sign on a bank flashed 19 F (-7 Celsius). Patches of ice sparkled in parking lots where puddles froze overnight. The continental U.S., when averaged out, reached a low of -10 C overnight Monday, according to calculations by Ryan Maue of Weather Bell Analytics. An estimated 190 million people in the U.S. were subjected to the icy blast, caused by a kink in the \\"polar vortex,\\" the strong winds that surround the North Pole. In Chicago, it was too cold even for the polar bear at the Lincoln Park Zoo. While polar bears can handle below freezing cold in the wild, Anana was kept inside Monday because she doesn't have the thick layer of fat that bears typically get from feeding on seals and whale carcasses.

Brennan is offered a job at the Willis Aircraft Company as chief test pilot for an experimental high speed jet fighter known as the JA-3, designed by Carl Troxell (Richard Whorf). Troxell is also a link to Brennan's past, having known him in the war when Brennan was a bomber pilot. A flashback to B-17 missions over Germany reveal Brennan to be a top-notch pilot. Another connection to his past is his former flame, Jo Holloway (Eleanor Parker), now Willis' secretary. In order to prove the capabilities of the new JA-3, capable of speeds up to 1,400Â mph (2,300Â km/h), Brennan convinces Willis that a record-breaking flight from Nome, Alaska to Washington D.C., via the North Pole, will impress the government. At the same time, Troxell tries to develop a safer version of the revolutionary aircraft, the JA-4, equipped with an escape pod, but dies during a test flight.

Positive Movie Review: The Shape of Water (2017) The Shape of Water, a beautifully touching and captivating fantasy drama film, swept away audiences and critics alike upon its release in 2017. Directed by renowned filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, the movie draws the viewer into a world brimming with magic, love, and vivid imagination. Set during the height of the Cold War, the story follows Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor working at a secret government facility. Hawkins' exceptional performance as Elisa helped to convey deep emotions, despite her character's lack of speech. Alongside her is Octavia Spencer, who plays the role of Elisa's loyal coworker and friend, Zelda, with a delightful energy that contributes to the on-screen chemistry. Michael Shannon's Colonel Richard Strickland is a chilling antagonist who embodies the fears and prejudices of the era. At the heart of the story is an amphibious man (Doug Jones), a fantastical creature feared and misunderstood by the facility's personnel. As Elisa establishes a connection with this alluring being, their growing attachment transcends species and social boundaries alike. The film explores themes of isolation, persecution, and the power of love as a way to overcome adversity. The Shape of Water is brought to life by Guillermo del Toro's masterful direction, which not only provides a mesmerizing visual spectacle but also creates a dreamlike ambiance that transcends the movie screen. The creature design, executed by Jones' notable performance, demonstrates del Toro's signature touch creating memorable and fascinating characters. The simple yet profound concept of communication without words is underlined through the emotional bond between the two lead characters. The film's breathtaking cinematography by Dan Laustsen shines through the movie's every frame. The lush visuals, set designs, and color palette are a feast for the eyes, transporting the viewer into a world beyond our own. The Academy Award-winning score by Alexandre Desplat perfectly complements the film's atmospheric qualities. Each musical note helps to evoke the ambiance and emotions that drive the characters, delicately blending whimsy with more somber moments. Furthermore, the screenplay by del Toro and Vanessa Taylor is well-crafted and poetic, encapsulating a wide range of emotions in ways that feel genuine and relatable. The characters are complex and multi-dimensional, leaving the audience fully invested in their struggles and triumphs. Ultimately, The Shape of Water is a stunning and enchanting experience, a testament to del Toro's unwavering passion for storytelling. It expertly combines elements of romance, fantasy, and suspense, all while tackling themes of love, acceptance, and what it truly means to be human. This unforgettable piece of modern cinema will undoubtedly continue to captivate audiences for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"On what island were Arawak pottery shards found?\\" Answer: \\"Nueva Sevilla\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct.

The image made the front pages of newspapers around the country and immediately whizzed around the Internet. But on Monday, Mr. Van Duzer found that fame can be a complicated proposition. The Yelp profile page for his pizza place, which had only two reviews before Monday (â€śLove the Pizza, wings, subs and the best strombolie [sic] in townâ€ť) was suddenly inundated with hundreds of reviews, making it perhaps the most politically charged pizza review board around. â€śPolitics aside. I hate this place is gonna get any kind of publicity. The pizza is terrible and greasy. NOTHING like NY,â€ť wrote Smith K. of Knoxville, Tenn. But others quickly came to the defense of Mr. Van Duzer and his pizza. â€śAll in all, I recommend the ham and pineapple pizza to any pizza eater earning less than 500,000 per year who likes tax cuts, less war, an end to torture, and dead terrorist kingpins,â€ť wrote Dennis J. of Milton, Ontario. By the end of the day, sentiment was running overwhelmingly in favor of Mr. Van Duzerâ€™s pizza and his politics, with many nevertheless saying the two should never mix. â€śPizza is Pizza and one should be judged on how good the crust is and not your political stance,â€ť wrote Rob S. of San Francisco. ||||| The owner of a Florida pizza shop says people are boycotting his business because he bear-hugged President Barack Obama on Sunday. (PHOTOS: Obama and Romney stop for food) Text Size - + reset Obama gets bear hug “People are saying a lot of bad things and boycotting my restaurant,” Scott Van Duzer, 46, told POLITICO. “There’s no middle line anymore, and that’s exactly what’s wrong with our country right now.” The owner of Big Apple Pizza & Pasta Restaurant in Fort Pierce, Fla., said that both Democrats and Republicans are welcome in his store. But he also said he thinks Mitt Romney’s running mate Rep. Paul Ryan — whose sculpted abs are thanks to intense P90X training sessions — would lose to the president in a workout battle. (PHOTOS: President Obama off the bench) “I think Obama could take him,” Van Duzer said, laughing. “Obama looked pretty fast and pretty quick on his feet.” So is Van Duzer. For a guy who biked 1,148 miles in 31 days from Florida to Washington D.C., lifting Obama was a piece of cake — err, a slice of pizza. And Van Duzer says he wasn’t even warmed up. “I don’t work out that much, man. Usually, it’s about two days per week. The bike ride was my big thing,” Van Duzer said. “I’m starting to go back to the gym right now. I need to start maintaining.” Van Duzer’s June bike-trek was part of his Van Duzer Foundation, and helped raise awareness for blood donation shortages. Founded in 2008 to support a local firefighter whose house burned down, the foundation has since raised more than 600,000, Van Duzer said. Van Duzer said he rode with a few kids from the Boys and Girls Club and met with U.S. Surgeon General Regina M. Benjamin to discuss blood shortages. Obama told The New York Times that Van Duzer’s effort in promoting blood donations was part of the reason the campaign decided to visit his pizza shop. “One of the reasons that we wanted to stop by is that Scott has been doing unbelievable work out of this pizza shop in promoting the importance of donating blood,” Obama told the Times. “And so he has set some records here in Florida. He has received commendations from the White House, the surgeon general, he has galvanized and mobilized the local community and he’s educating kids and folks all across the country on this issue.” Inside the shop Sunday, Obama wanted to know how to look like Van Duzer. “Everybody look at these guns,” Obama said. “If I eat your pizza, will I look like that?” (Also on POLITICO: Fit for office: 2012 candidates in the best shape ever) Van Duzer told POLITICO that he packs on protein with his homemade pepperoni pizza. And the 6-foot-3-inch, 260-pound Van Duzer says he bench presses 350 pounds at six reps, usually twice a week — nearly double the estimated 176 pounds that Obama weighs. “When I was in peak condition, I lifted five times a week,” he said. “But that was before my injury.” He tore his Achilles tendon during an “intense” charity dodgeball game. Mainly, he says his active, energetic lifestyle keeps him fit. “I move around a lot,” he said. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Florida pizza shop owner Scott Van Duzer became nationally famous after images of him lifting President Obama in a surprise bear hug circulated the internet. Following this event in his restaurant, his previously quiet Yelp profile page exploded with polarised reviews and became an unexpected political discussion panel. Reactions ranged from people criticizing the quality of his pizza and his positive interaction with the Democratic President, to people supporting Van Duzer and his stance. Van Duzer states that his business felt the backlash from his impromptu, friendly gesture to the President as he began experiencing a wave of negative comments and customers boycotting his restaurant, demonstrating the divide in the American political landscape. Despite the political attention his business received, Van Duzer stands by the fact that people of all political affiliations are welcome in his pizza place. The pizza shop owner is also known for his June bike-trek from Florida to Washington D.C., a journey amounting to 1,148 miles over 31 days. This was conducted as part of his Van Duzer Foundation, aimed at raising awareness for blood donation shortages. As such, not only was the Obama campaign's stop by the pizza outside the traditional path, but it also recognized the good work Van Duzer did in promoting blood donations. In a final note, Van Duzer asserted that he thinks President Obama, due to his quickness and agility, could win in a workout battle against Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan.

The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \\"one mighty in power\\", the one who \\"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer.\\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the Encyclopaedia of Islam that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Muhammad describing the revelations as being like the ringing of a bell refers to the manner in which he experienced the divine messages from Allah. These revelations were transmitted to him by the Angel Jibril (Gabriel) and formed the basis of the Quran. According to the Sahih al-Bukhari, a highly regarded collection of hadith, Muhammad described the revelations sometimes occurring as sudden and powerful, akin to the sound of a ringing bell. Muhammad's wife, Aisha, also reported witnessing the Prophet receiving divine inspiration on a cold day, with sweat visibly dripping from his forehead as the process completed. This highlights the intense and awe-inspiring nature of these revelations and the impact they had on Muhammad both physically and psychologically. The process of receiving these revelations was often accompanied by visions or other intense experiences. For instance, as per the Quran, the first revelation sent to Muhammad came with a vision where he saw the \\"one mighty in power\\", presumably referring to the angel Jibril, who initially seemed far away but then quickly approached the Prophet. Islamic studies scholar, Welch, suggests that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's experiences during these moments of revelation may be considered authentic as they portray the deep disturbance he went through. The severity of these experiences would have provided convincing evidence to those around him of the superhuman origin of the messages he received. However, some of Muhammad's critics in ancient Arabia accused him of being possessed, a soothsayer, or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such individuals of that time. It remains uncertain whether these unique experiences took place before or after he began to proclaim his prophethood.

Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Problem:Background Paragraph: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:. Story: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. Question: Which case would have longer year, case A or case C? Solution:","completion":"Case C"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A few suggested questions for McCain and Obama Tuesday, October 14th 2008, 11:52 AM The questions that John McCain and Barack Obama really need to answer won't be asked Wednesday night. With the final presidential debate scheduled forÂ Wednesday and the previous two having revealed nothing about the candidates, I have taken it upon myself to suggest some questions for CBS' Bob Schieffer, who will do the moderating chores. I assure you that the candidates have not seen the questions in advance nor, when the time comes, will they want to answer them. Sen. Obama goes first. Sen. Obama, you are sooooooooo cool. Can you tell us, please, the last time you lost your temper and what about? Sen. McCain, I'd like to ask you why you've attacked Sen. Obama for associating with theformer domestic terrorist, Bill Ayers, even though you have befriended G. Gordon Liddy, who was jailed for what amounts to subversion of the Constitution. Liddy also once told his radio listeners to deal with ATF agents by shooting them - \\"a head shot,\\" he recommended. What's the difference between Liddy and Ayers? Sen. Obama, did you ever tell Bill Ayers to his face that what he did was wrong? Sen. McCain, I have a question regarding Sarah Palin: How could you? Sen. Obama, in 2007, your former church and its then-minister honored the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, an anti-Semite. Why didn't you say something in protest? Have you ever heard the Latin dictum \\"Qui tacet consentire videtur,\\" silence is consent? Sen. McCain, what lessons should we have learned from the Iraq war? Should we have stuck to Afghanistan? What are our limits as a great power? Sen. Obama, if your plan for troop withdrawal in Iraq had been adopted, the U.S. troops would now be almost out of the country. That being the case, what do you think we'd have there now? Civil war? A peaceful country? Sen. McCain, do you ever wake up in the middle of the night and wonder if history will forgive you for Sarah Palin? Sen. Obama, do you ever wake up in the middle of night for anything? Sen. McCain, with the situation in Afghanistan worsening, why don't we switch our troops right away from Iraq, which didn't attack us, to the country from where Osama Bin Laden and his Taliban supporters did? Sen. Obama, given the problems facing our country - a worldwide financial crisis, the prospect of nukes in Iran and North Korea, and Pakistan, which already has nukes, coming apart - isn't it reckless of you to think that, with your limited experience, you can manage it all? Sen. McCain, virtually the same question to you. But in your case, given your age, isn't this all too much for you? Sen. Obama, have you ever been in therapy? If so, how did it make you feel? Sen. McCain, in May, you allowed a restricted number of reporters to review your medical records for a limited amount of time. Some people think you're hiding something. Are you? Why not make all the records public? Sen. Obama, we all know that lobbyists are not the problem in Washington; it's the incessant need of politicians to raise campaign funds. Yet you broke your pledge to accept public financing for your campaign. Didn't you contribute to the problem? Sen. McCain, you are 72 and have had skin cancer several times. Given that - not to mention the usual exigencies of life - how could you pick a running mate who is so dismally qualified for the presidency? Please, for the sake of your own reputation, don't say anything about the Alaska National Guard. Sen. Obama and Sen. McCain, you both favor NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time? Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid.

Write a title: AP - Iran and Saudi Arabia called Monday for the United Nations to intervene in Iraq to stop the fighting between U.S. forces and Shhite militants hiding in the holy city of Najaf.","completion":"Title: \\"Urgent United Nations Intervention Sought by Iran and Saudi Arabia to Halt the US-Shiite Conflict in Najaf, Iraq\\" The escalating conflict between the United States military forces and the Shiite militants entrenched in the revered city of Najaf in Iraq has prompted Iran and Saudi Arabia to issue a joint call for the direct intervention of the United Nations. As the crisis deepens, the increasing violence and human suffering in the region have emerged as key concerns for both nations, and their request reflects the urgency of the situation as well as the shared desire to preserve the sanctity of Najaf, a city of immense religious and historical significance for the Islamic world. As neighboring countries with deep-rooted connections to the region's religious and political landscape, both Iran and Saudi Arabia have high stakes in the stability of Iraq. Between Iran's majority Shiite population and Saudi Arabia's influence as the guardian of the world's holiest Islamic sites, both countries possess a vested interest in preventing bloodshed and destruction in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf. The current conflict in Najaf presents a grim reality that highlights the delicate balance of power in the region and the perpetual struggle for control among various factions. Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, the entire region's peace, stability, and safety are under threat as sectarian divisions and historical grievances are exacerbated by mounting aggression from both the US forces and Shiite militants. In their call for decisive United Nations action, Iran and Saudi Arabia have underscored the importance of protecting civilian lives and preserving the sanctity of Najaf's holy sites. Furthermore, the two nations have emphasized the dire need for humanitarian assistance to support the local population, especially where access to basic necessities - such as food, water, and medical care - has been severely disrupted by the ongoing conflict. The joint plea by Iran and Saudi Arabia calls on the international community to recognize the urgency and gravity of the situation. It specifically appeals to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members to utilize their influence by crafting a legally binding resolution aimed at putting a stop to the escalating violence, ensuring the protection of civilians, and facilitating political dialogue between the conflicting parties. The proposed response involves the United Nations deploying a neutral peacekeeping force in Najaf to manage the safe evacuation of civilians caught in the conflict, as well as overseeing the withdrawal of both US troops and Shiite militants from the city. Simultaneously, a diplomatic process - facilitated by the UN - should be instigated, focusing on creating a framework for long-term national reconciliation, rebuilding the shattered infrastructure, and establishing durable peace in Iraq. Ultimately, the joint call from Iran and Saudi Arabia for the United Nations intervention in Iraq serves as not only a desperate plea to halt the bloodshed and protect the cultural heritage of the region but also an opportunity for the international community to come together and work towards securing peace and stability in the Middle East. Should the United Nations respond positively and effectively to this appeal, it has the potential to set the stage for lasting peace and positive change across the region, altering the trajectory of multiple ongoing conflicts and easing tensions between various religious and political groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin is set on the Greek island of Kefalonia. Kefalonia, also spelled Cephalonia, is the largest of the Ionian Islands in western Greece. The novel, written by British author Louis de Bernières and published in 1994, takes place during the Italian and German occupation of the island during World War II. The plot revolves around the lives of the island's inhabitants and several key events that occurred during this period, such as the Italian occupation, the massacre of the Italian Acqui Division by the Germans, and the fierce battles that ensued as the Axis powers sought to maintain control over the island. The story primarily revolves around the characters of Dr. Iannis, a local Greek physician, his daughter Pelagia, and Antonio Corelli, the captain of an Italian regiment stationed on the island. As Captain Corelli's Mandolin progresses, it charts the development of a romantic relationship between Pelagia and Corelli. This relationship is complicated by the harsh realities of war, conflicting loyalties, and the broader historical context in which the novel is set. Besides its exploration of romantic love, the novel delves into themes such as loyalty, patriotism, and the human capacity for both cruelty and compassion in times of war. As an Englishman writing about a foreign culture and history, de Bernières drew from extensive research to recreate the atmosphere, everyday life, and historical events of wartime Kefalonia. The novel, with its rich description of the island's landscapes and natural beauty, fueled a surge in tourism to Kefalonia after the book's publication. In 2001, Captain Corelli's Mandolin was adapted into a feature film directed by John Madden and starring Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli and Penélope Cruz as Pelagia. The film, while commercially successful, faced mixed reviews, with many arguing that it failed to fully capture the depth and complexity of the original novel. Nonetheless, the film further popularized Kefalonia as a travel destination and contributed to the ongoing interest in the island and its history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What did Selim accomplish against the Mamluk Sultanate?\\" Context: \\"Muslim sects regarded as heretical, such as the Druze, Ismailis, Alevis, and Alawites, ranked below Jews and Christians. In 1514, Sultan Selim I, nicknamed \\"the Grim\\" because of his cruelty, ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Alevis (Qizilbash), whom he considered heretics, reportedly proclaiming that \\"the killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\\"[page needed] Selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East, especially through his conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, which included much of the region. With these conquests, Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic caliphate, although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with Murad I (reigned 1362 to 1389). The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Sultan Selim I, also known as \\"the Grim,\\" accomplished a significant feat against the Mamluk Sultanate by successfully conquering it. This endeavor led to the rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East. The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt was a powerful state that comprised a substantial portion of the Middle Eastern region. Selim's conquest allowed the Ottoman Empire to absorb the vast territories of the Mamluk Sultanate, including Egypt, the Levant, and Hejaz. By defeating the Mamluk Sultanate, Selim I not only expanded the Ottoman Empire's territories but also strengthened its claim to be an Islamic caliphate. Although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century, beginning with Murad I, Selim's conquests in the Middle East further solidified this claim. The caliphate would continue to be held by Ottoman sultans until its eventual abolition in 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the subsequent exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France. In summary, Selim I's accomplishments against the Mamluk Sultanate include the successful conquest of the entire Mamluk realm, significant expansion of the Ottoman Empire's territories into the Middle East, and reinforcement of the empire's claim to the Islamic caliphate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was committed for trial? ? On 1 March 1849, Brown was charged with the murder of \\"unknown aboriginal natives\\". In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: By 1964, it was possible for a major studio to make a film touching upon the Spanish Civil War without having to answer to some senate investigating committee or other. Based on Emeric Pressburger's novel A Mouse on Sunday, Behold a Pale Horse stars Gregory Peck as a Republican war veteran Manuel Artiguez who continues waging a one-man offensive 20 years after hostilities have officially ceased. Pressburger's novel was loosely based on the last raid of real-life anarchist guerrilla Antonio Sabate who was killed in an ambush in 1959.When the young son of an old comrade in arms comes to the French border village where Artiguez is exiled, he asks the old warrior to avenge the death of his father at the hands of vengeful Nationalist police captain Vinolas played by Anthony Quinn. At first Manuel refuses, but when Manuel learns that his aged mother Pilar (Mildred Dunnock) is dying he's determined to return to Spain to bid farewell to her. Pilar dies before Manuel can embark on his journey, but with the aid of traitorous smuggler Carlos (Raymond Pelligrin) Captain Vinolas keeps up the pretence that she still lives so that he can lure Manuel back to Spain and ambush him. Although a sympathetic priest (Omar Sharif) advises Manuel that he's being tricked, Manuel determines to return at all costs. Aware of the trap that's been set for him, Manuel engages the police in a fire fight, wounding Vinolas, killing Carlos and dying himself in the process.In 1966, Behold a Pale Horse was scheduled to be telecast on a major American network, but was cancelled at the last minute, reportedly at the behest of the Spanish government.

Answer: Men who had been free people of color before the war comprised 26% of those elected to state and federal office in South Carolina from 1868 to 1876. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: Between 1868 and 1876, the percentage of elected officials who were Freemen varies depending on the region and state. However, in South Carolina, 26% of those elected to state and federal office during this period were Freemen, or men who were previously free people of color before the Civil War. This period falls under the era of Reconstruction in the United States (1865-1877), which was a time of great social and political change following the Civil War. The Reconstruction Era aimed to rebuild and reunite the nation, particularly Southern states, after the long and bloody conflict, while addressing issues of civil rights and equality for the newly emancipated African Americans. One significant change during the Reconstruction period was the passage of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which granted African Americans citizenship and voting rights. These constitutional amendments opened doors for many former slaves and Freemen to run for and be elected for public office, including positions within local and state governments and in the U.S. Congress. Freemen, or men who had been free people of color before the Civil War, were often more educated and better positioned to gain political power as they were more likely to have had access to opportunities denied to those who had been enslaved. Some of the most notable Freemen who were elected during the Reconstruction Era include Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce, both of whom served as Senators from Mississippi, and Robert Smalls, who represented South Carolina in the U.S House of Representatives. While these elections marked significant progress in inclusive representation and the participation of African Americans in politics, the percentage of those who were actually Freemen remains a small proportion of the total number of elected officials. This is partly due to the continued presence of racial discrimination and barriers that hindered voting for African Americans, especially in the Southern states. In addition, following the end of Reconstruction, the progress made in racial equality and civil rights during those years did not persist, with the advent of policies like the Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation and further marginalizing African Americans. In conclusion, although the percentage of Freemen among elected officials in this period was relatively small, their achievements were a significant step towards political participation and representation of African Americans in the United States. However, it is important to remember that the gains made during the Reconstruction Era faced significant backlash and challenges in subsequent years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Born in Nelson County, Virginia, Allen was the son of Loretta M. and Earl Raymond Allen, who was recorded in the 1920 and 1930 U.S. census records for Wayne County, Michigan as working as a chauffeur to a private family. He earned varsity letters in football, track and basketball at Lake Shore High School in St. Clair Shores, Michigan; having graduated in 1940. Allen went to Alma College in Michigan and later at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he was sent as an officer trainee in the U. S. Navy's World War II V-12 program. He graduated with a B.S. in education from Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University) in Ypsilanti, and then attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he earned his master's degree in physical education in 1947. After rejecting a 1 million, four-year contract offer throughout the 1977 season, Allen was dismissed by the Redskins in mid-January. He was replaced by one of his favorite players, Jack Pardee, by then the promising young head coach of the Bears, who had gained the wild card playoff berth ahead of the Redskins; both had finished at 9-5. Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom was searching for a new coach after parting ways with Chuck Knox, and decided to bring Allen back. Allen's hiring was announced on February 1, and he returned to Los Angeles in 1978 with much media fanfare. His second stint as the Rams' head coach was an unfortunate experience for all concerned. Unlike his first stint, Allen did not have full authority over personnel. He thus worked with general manager Don Klosterman to oversee a talented roster that had made the team a perennial playoff challenger. Allen brought with him his scrupulous discipline and attention to detail, which extended to practice-field protocol and dining-hall decorum. However, his coaching style did not play well with the new generation of NFL players, and a group of Ram players chafed at the regulations almost immediately. Some made their grievances public; a few, including standout linebacker Isiah Robertson, briefly left camp. As newspaper reports were quoting players expressing confidence that differences would be resolved, the Rams played listlessly and lost the first two games of the 1978 exhibition schedule. Rosenbloom decided that for the season to be salvaged a change must be made, and the announcement of Allen's abrupt dismissal was made on August 13. Many of Allen's own players were surprised by the decision. Defensive coordinator Ray Malavasi, well-respected and liked by players (and the only holdover from Chuck Knox' staff), replaced him; the Rams ultimately advanced to that year's NFC Championship Game and the following year to the Super Bowl. Rosenbloom died in April 1979. Allen soon joined CBS Sports as an analyst for NFL network telecasts, and worked in the broadcast booth from 1978 to 1983. With former Cleveland Browns great running back Jim Brown and play-by-play announcer Vin Scully, they were the network's only three-man announcing team.

On 17 June, as they prepared to leave again, Nansen thought he heard a dog bark and went to investigate. He then heard voices, and a few minutes later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due to call that summer. As he approached, Jackson saw \\"a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease\\". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: \\"You are Nansen, aren't you?\\", and received the reply \\"Yes, I am Nansen.\\"Johansen was rescued, and the pair taken to the base at Cape Flora, where they posed for photographs (in one instance re-enacting the Jackson–Nansen meeting) before taking baths and haircuts.

Write highlights for this article: My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson has been called a 'deadbeat dad' by his ex-wife in an explosive interview which also revealed the former tennis pro is friends with show judge Pete Evans. Cindy Anderson, Adam's former wife of almost 20 years, told A Current Affair on Monday night that her ex owes her tens of thousands of dollars in child support for their five children, aged between eight and 15 years of age. Adam's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married to Carol Molloy - his partner on the Channel 7 reality show - but she claims that's when her issues with child support payments began. Cindy also claimed that Adam used to coach My Kitchen Rules judge Pete on the tennis court and that the pair worked together at his Kings Cross restaurant Hugo's, in Sydney, after she split with him. 'He has known Pete Evans, he knows him through tennis, through coaching him,' Cindy told reporter Brady Halls. Scroll down for video. Owing child support? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson's ex-wife, Cindy, told A Current Affair on Monday night that he owes their five children approximately twelve months worth of child support, amassing tens of thousands of dollars. 'Deadbeat dad'? The former tennis professional is alleged to be providing his children with 'no financial support at all' according to his former wife. 'We get no financial support at all,' she also told Brady. Cindy claims her concern is that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year, which she says 'worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father.' 'The children also have no emotional support from him. He does not ring them, nor come and see them,' she said, adding 'they do not receive a card [for birthdays] in the mail, not even a phone call.' 'He's never played an active, massive role in their lives anyway...but basically his role now is non-existent, he's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children,' Cindy said. Happier times: The couple were married for almost 20 years and had five children together. Ranging in age: Their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age. Adam's ex also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it's 'significantly impacting on the children', with the blonde single mother saying she's speaking on A Current Affair instead of dealing with the matter privately because 'He has blocked my number and both his childrens' numbers - the older two girls have phones'. Cindy not only took aim at Adam during the interview but also at the Child Support Agency and producers of My Kitchen Rules. 'It seems there is little they [child support agency] can do, irrespective of him being in the print that he's working at three private schools doing tennis, irrespective of his face being on My Kitchen Rules. 'They consistently say there is no source of collection, there is no avenue for us to collect revenue,' she said. Upset: The blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after Adam's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters. Making money? Cindy said she was most upset because her ex speaks of coaching at private schools but is allegedly unable to pay monies to his children. Spokesman and General Manager for the Department of Human services, who over-sees the Child Support Agency, Hank Jongen told Brady: 'I can't talk about individual cases but let me assure you, that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations.' 'We will do whatever it takes to recover that money,' he added. While Cindy claims she wrote to producers of the show to find out if he was being paid for his appearances to garnish money from his wages, she was left without a response. A Channel Seven spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia in response to Cindy's claims: 'This is a private matter between the parties involved.' Channel Seven also refuted the claim, that Adam and Pete are friends: 'They [Adam and Pete] met for the first time on the program'. On TV: Cindy says there is no bitterness that Adam has moved on and re-married recently, to his MKR partner Carol Molloy (pictured) Friends in high place?

Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of NBC musical variety radio program The Chesterfield Supper Club. On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show.

Q:At an early meeting of the British Sociological Association’s “Activism in Sociology Forum” members met to discuss how we might play a more campaigning role in the world outside the academy. Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study... How did the author feel after he saw the response to his expressed viewpoint at the meeting?

Article:The 21-year-old woman was one of the subjects of the investigation and is in a serious but stable condition. A raid also took place in Kent, with six people arrested in total. Officers say the operation was not connected to an arrest near Parliament on Thursday, when a man was detained on suspicion of terror offences. The house in Harlesden Road, Willesden, which was raided on Thursday evening, had been under observation by police. Those arrested included a 16-year-old boy, a man and woman, both aged 20 and another man and woman both aged 28. A 43-year-old woman was also arrested in Kent. All of them were detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts. The woman who was shot is under police guard in hospital but has not been arrested \\"due to her condition\\", Alex Paton, 50, who lives in Harlesden Road, said he saw a woman \\"getting all cuffed up and put in a white suit\\". He described seeing \\"coppers and masked men with guns\\". Another resident said she had heard the \\"bang, bang, bang\\" of shots. A neighbour of the raided property suggested the shot woman had suffered injuries to her left arm and stomach. He said the family who lived there were from Somalia. Ruth Haile, who lives in the road, said she heard shots and the woman on the ground shouting: \\"Don't touch me, my body, don't touch my dress.\\" It is believed to be the first time a woman has been shot by police in 10 years. The last time was in 2007 when Ann Sanderson was fatally shot in Kent. Police said searches had taken place at \\"linked addresses\\", as well as where the arrests took place. Neil Basu, deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said: \\"Due to these arrests that have been made yesterday, in both cases I believe that we have contained the threats that they pose.\\" By home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The intelligence convinced Scotland Yard they needed to go in fast and hard to carry out arrests. That means they feared there was some kind of threat that needed to be contained - a threat that required a large team of the most highly-trained available officers. They fired CS gas canisters into the building, smashing holes in the top front window. The 21-year-old woman who was shot is not one of those under arrest - but has been described by police as one of the \\"subjects\\" - security services speak for someone at the heart of an operation. We don't know anything about how and why she was injured and that will be subject of a police watchdog investigation, as is always the case.

The IPCC said it was gathering evidence but that no officers were under investigation. On Thursday, police arrested a 27-year-old man at the junction of Parliament Street and Parliament Square, in London, as part of an intelligence-led operation. He was identified on Friday as Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali, a British national who is believed to have gone to school in Tottenham, north London, but was not born in the UK. The Met said he had been detained on suspicion of terrorism offences and that knives were recovered from the scene. He had been on the force's radar for some time and it is thought police acted after a concerned family member contacted them. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she had spoken to the Met about both incidents and thanked them for their actions. \\"I would like to reinforce my gratitude to the police and security services, who work tirelessly around the clock to keep the people of this country safe,\\" she said. \\"They carry out their duties with calmness and professionalism, and we are all grateful for their dedication.\\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning A summary of the above article is?","completion":"A 21-year-old woman was shot and six people were arrested in anti-terror raids in north-west London and Kent by the Metropolitan Police.

To set up an eBay account, click on the blue “register” hyperlink in the top left corner of the homepage. You’ll be asked to provide basic personal information, a method of payment for your seller’s fees, and a username. Think of your username as the company name of your online store. Make it a personal brand that is appealing and catchy without sounding too obscure or awkward. You’ll receive payments from any clothes you sell through PayPal. A verified account is easy to set up, allows to you sell internationally, and gives you more credibility on eBay. You’ll find a link to PayPal setup on your eBay account page. To begin, click on the “Sell” link on the top left-hand side of the eBay homepage. After choosing “Create a listing,” you’ll be asked to type in a description of the item. Follow the example provided, listing at least of few characteristics of the item, including gender, size, color, and style. A category will then be suggested for you, and if it seems accurate, click on “Create Listing.” For example, a search for “women’s gray LL Bean capri pants size 10\\" will recommend the category of \\"Pants.\\" Include basic elements such as brand name, style, color, and material. The more descriptive your title, the more often the item will show up in shoppers' search results. For example, an appropriate title for a pair of jeans is something like, \\"Ralph Lauren Polo Jeans Black Classic Boot Cut Size 8.\\" Be as descriptive as possible, including the brand name, material, size, color, and any pattern or embellishments. Use adjectives such as “dark” and “light” for colors, since the photo won’t appear the same on all screens. For women’s dresses give waist size and dress length, and for men’s shirts give armpit-to-armpit length, plus sleeve length. For example, a good description of a vintage blouse would be, \\"Vintage 70's Pat Argenti sheer ruffle front blouse. Small black buttons in back, faux button front. No size tag so please check measurements for fitting. Measures unstretched approximately: 40\\" (102cm) bust, 40\\" waist, 23\\" (58cm) shoulder to hemline. Dark green velvet ribbon detailing. Please note ribbon coming apart near the neck, also separating near the underarm & bust seams.\\" Give all measurements in both inches and centimeters for the convenience of international shoppers. Other helpful measurements include bust/chest, waist, hips, inseam, pant length, and bell width (for skirts or dresses). You have the option of selling the item at a price that you set, or putting it up for bid along with the option of a fixed-price sale (“Buy it Now”). If you’re concerned about your auction item selling at a really low price, you can set a reserve price under which it can’t be sold. Otherwise, for less valuable items, setting a low starting bid at 1 or lower can attract a high volume of bargain hunters. The greater the number of bidders, the better the chance for bidding competition that elevates selling prices. On the \\"Create Your Listing\\" page, in the section titled \\"Bring your item to life with pictures, click on \\"Add Pictures.\\" You can add one photo for free, but additional shots will cost a little extra. It's worth paying this extra price, especially for the more valuable items, to add several pictures for the the customers' convenience. You can make three shipping price options available to potential customers: free shipping, flat fee shipping, and calculated cost shipping. Offer at least one other method besides free shipping in case the customer needs expedited shipping. For flat fee shipping, you set the shipping price when listing the item, based its packed weight. Use eBay’s shipping cost calculator to help estimate a cost for your item. With calculated cost shipping, the shipping cost will be calculated for your customers at check out, based on your zip code, the customer’s zip code, and the weight of the packed item. You’ll be given the option to choose mail carriers and shipping speeds to offer to potential buyers. Make as many shipping methods available as you’re willing to accommodate, but try at least to offer several expedited shipping options, since some customers might decide not to buy your item if they can’t get it promptly. Strongly consider offering free shipping: it’s an incentive to buyers, you’ll get an automatic 5-star seller rating for shipping, and you’ll show up higher on the list of shoppers’ searches for your items.

Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog.

In this case, the premise is that there is a huge electronics and computer selection featuring a home theater room and a classical listening room. 2. Hypothesis: A tentative assumption or supposition put forward to explain a phenomenon or form a basis for further investigation.

A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines.

Its main scriptures are the Vinaya Pitaka and the four principal Nikayas or Agamas. Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, so most scholars conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the Three marks of existence, the Five Aggregates, dependent origination, karma and rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and nirvana.

So, she quickly ducked down to avoid getting hit by the smelly poo. However, poor Tanya did not know what was going on, and she couldn't react fast enough. The flying poo landed on her, covering her from head to toe in smelly brown goo. She was shocked and upset by the smelly surprise. Amy immediately jumped up to help her friend, guiding Tanya to a nearby water fountain to wash off the icky poo. Hand in hand, they walked over, Amy trying to assure Tanya that everything would be okay.

Determine the sentiment: This movie is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century, but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys, chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society, specifically when that technology is used for warfare. This movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology, but as the circle completes itself, familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology. Brilliant for it's time, the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some, but as a landmark in the history, development, and evolution of the sci-fi genre, it is a must. In the end, free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed, the state of society itself, as shaped by world events. Those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so, but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains, as this film posits. As far as qualifying as sci-fi, one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it's speculative nature. It asks us the questions, what if these events happened this way, and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it? How would we react?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Ted Thornhill. Smog and air pollution are lingering environmental problems in China. But a city in the northwestern region is determined to fight against dirty air using nothing more complicated than plain old tap water. Recently, local residents in Lanzhou, capital of northwest Chinas Gansu province, found that two giant sprayers had been set up at the Dongfanghong Square where a subway station of the city's Metro Line 1 is under construction. Will they see clearly now? The water sprayers will throw pulverized water 2,000 feet into the air to dispel pollution. Grand cannon: The sprayers have been placed next to construction works for a new subway station. Size matters: The cannons are enormous and have been getting a lot of attention from passers-by. The two long-range sprayers are able to pulverize and spurt out tap water to wipe out dust and smog within a radius of 600 meters to reduce air pollution caused by the metro construction. Martyn Chipperfield, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Leeds, said the water will cling on to the pollutants and bring them back down to earth. He told MailOnline: 'Lanzhou has a big problem with smog, like lots of Chinese cities. This is a small-scale effort to damp down the dust. The water will go up as a fine mist, and stick to the dust and form larger particles - and fall back down to the surface under gravity. It's basically replicating rain on a local level.' This does of course mean that anyone in the vicinity is likely to get quite mucky. However, Professor Chipperfield said that 'it will stop dust spreading over a wider area'. It won't stop pollution elsewhere, though, he added. Earlier this year Chinese scientists said that pollution 900 miles away in Beijing was so dense that its effects were comparable to that of a nuclear winter. It has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated, so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply. Issue: Pollution is a major problem in many Chinese cities. Calamity: Earlier this year the pollution in Beijing was said by one expert to be having a similar effect to that of a nuclear winter. This process was under way in China’s capital city and six northern provinces, according to He Dongxian from China Agricultural University’s College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering.She warned that the toxic smog was hindering photosynthesis of plants and that if it lingers much longer, it could affect food production, according to The Guardian. Pollution had been so severe that aircraft were grounded, roads closed and tourists numbers hit, while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the World Health Organisation, whose readings in Beijing in February had alarming results. It was reported that the level of PM 2.5 particles, a key measure of pollution because they are small enough to be assimilated into the blood stream, reached 505 micrograms per cubic metre, far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe, which is 25. Authorities have introduced anti-pollution policies and often pledged to clean up the environment but the problem has not eased. It remains to be seen whether the water sprayers can form part of a long-term solution. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is about a city in China that is trying to fight air pollution using giant sprayers that shoot tap water into the air. The city is called Lanzhou, and they have set up these big water sprayers near a construction site to help clean the air.

Options: A. carrying things B. coffee cup C. iron D. frying pan E. briefcase Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, the items most likely to have a hot handle are the coffee cup, iron, and frying pan. Each of these items typically involves exposure to high temperatures, which can make their handles hot to touch. Option B: Coffee Cup - Coffee cups often contain hot beverages, such as coffee or tea. These cups are designed to hold high-temperature liquids, and some heat can transfer from the contents to the handle, making it warm or hot to touch. However, many coffee cups have ergonomic handles specifically designed to stay relatively cool even when the cup is filled with boiling water. This option, while plausible, might not be the most accurate in comparison to the other choices. Option C: Iron - Irons are appliances explicitly designed to heat up for the purpose of pressing and smoothing out clothes. The heat produced by the iron usually comes from its flat, metal base, and it is not uncommon for the heat to transfer to its handle, especially after extended use. As a result, the handle of a hot iron can become hot, sometimes even requiring the use of a glove or cloth for protection when handling. Option D: Frying Pan - A frying pan is also used to cook food at high temperatures, which means that its handle is prone to becoming hot. The materials used in manufacturing frying pans and the thickness of the handle can determine just how hot the handle gets when in use. Some frying pans have handles made from heat-resistant materials or have silicone coverings to help minimize heat transfer. Nevertheless, the handle on a frying pan can still get very hot, especially when cooking for an extended period or on high heat. In conclusion, the most accurate answer based on common sense would be option D, the frying pan. While the other options mentioned can have hot handles, the frying pan is more consistently exposed to high temperatures and direct heat, making it the item most likely to have a hot handle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So if you like low limit gambling like 5 blackjack, craps, and roulette, and 1-2 NL and 2-4 L poker, this place is for you. This new \\"Eastside Cannery\\" is the latest, with a cool \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" retro theme. 2. On this opening Thursday night, the place was really hoppin. The blackjack and craps tables were all completely full: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Zvnm7o2eMaYAEHS8YRn_EQ?select=dNek-585lb4cDkZ3rltNYg Bursting at the seams even: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Zvnm7o2eMaYAEHS8YRn_EQ?select=UotxL53yD4xk8l--NxHCww I've been to the Palazzo a number of times and I've never seen the tables there even half full, honestly. This place will give the big casinos on the Strip with their high limits a run for their money. 3. Nice little sportsbook: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Zvnm7o2eMaYAEHS8YRn_EQ?select=iPvy5RYGgXxuQBjmqJuWcw Just after this photo was taken, the lady in pink yelled \\"Bet it all on the pretty horsey!!\\" and then collapsed in a cloud of second hand smoke and foundation powder, which I thought was exciting.

I briefly considered playing but then remembered how much I hate that game nowadays. 5. Slots! Lots and lots of slots! Ebay slots: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Zvnm7o2eMaYAEHS8YRn_EQ?select=XtKm5YY9WyrzqzyIoGoL4Q I'm amused that ebay slots are no different than any other slots, same rules, they just have pictures of purses and shoes on them.

No uber rich Asian businessmen or Middle Eastern oil magnates here, just the low rollers. This night that approach seemed to be working, with not an empty table in the house. Is this review positive or negative?","completion":"The review can be considered mostly positive with some neutral elements. The reviewer highlights several aspects of the Eastside Cannery Casino in Las Vegas that they appreciate, including the low limit gambling, bustling atmosphere, sportsbook, poker room, variety of slots, and bingo hall.

However, they do acknowledge some downsides, such as less than ideal games in the poker room and the fact that it's not as luxurious as some other casinos. Overall, the review leans more towards a positive sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which planet has a higher internal heating?\\" is in \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Which planet has a higher internal heating?\\" is Neptune. This is because, as mentioned in the passage, Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun, while Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. The higher internal heating of Neptune contributes to its more varied weather when compared to Uranus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages.

Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses.

Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God.

Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

Article: Electricity, like clean water, is a resource that's often taken for granted. But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps. Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces o2 and H2O.\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the statement \\"When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces o2 and H2O.\\" is NOT true according to the passage. The passage states that when hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer this question: who invented slide rule and in what year??","completion":"The slide rule, an analog calculating instrument, was invented by British mathematician William Oughtred in 1622. However, its development can be credited to several key historical figures and their contributions. The device could trace its roots back to the invention of logarithms by Scottish mathematician John Napier in 1614. Napier's invention of logarithms allowed for complex multiplication and division problems to be transformed into more manageable addition and subtraction tasks. It was a substantial breakthrough, as it simplified calculations considerably for scientists and mathematicians of the time. In 1617, an English mathematician named Edmund Gunter further refined Napier's logarithms, creating logarithmic scales that were inscribed on rulers. Gunter's rulers were the precursor to the modern slide rule design and were valuable tools for scientific and engineering work. William Oughtred then capitalized on the ideas of Napier and Gunter and invented the first circular slide rule in 1622. Oughtred's circular slide rule enabled more accurate and precise calculations than Gunter's linear logarithmic scales. The device used two concentric circles with logarithmic scales, and a user could rotate one circle around the other to perform calculations. Later, in 1632, Oughtred improved his design and developed the more familiar linear slide rule, which featured two logarithmic scales held together by a sliding component. This innovation paved the way for modern slide rule designs, and its usage for calculations became widespread among scientists, engineers, and navigators through the centuries. The slide rule remained a popular calculation tool until the 1970s when electronic calculators rendered them obsolete. While few people use slide rules today, their impact on advancements in science, engineering, and navigation was undeniably significant. The invention of the slide rule by William Oughtred in 1622 was a pivotal moment that revolutionized the way calculations were made, laying the groundwork for future innovations in these fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I had heard so much about its exceptional service, beautiful landscapes, and welcoming atmosphere, but my recent experience was far from what I had ever expected. Upon arrival at the resort, we were greeted with disorganized chaos which, to my dismay, set the tone for our entire stay. The check-in process seemed to take an eternity, with the front desk staff appearing unfazed by the long lines and visibly irritated customers. The employees were unprofessional and unapologetic, making me feel as though I was imposing upon them rather than being warmly welcomed as a paying guest. Our room, while spacious, was surprisingly unkempt. The bed linens were visibly wrinkled with suspicious stains, causing us to question whether they had been cleaned after the previous guests' stay. The bathroom had a musky, damp odor, and there was mold growing in the grout between the tiles. The air conditioning unit, despite our multiple attempts to repair it, seemed incapable of cooling the room sufficiently, causing sleepless, uncomfortable nights. The dining options at The Azure Resort were lackluster, to say the least. The on-site restaurant had a limited menu which failed to cater to various dietary preferences. As vegetarians, we found it difficult to find filling and appetizing options beyond basic salads and a small variety of unremarkable side dishes. The breakfast buffet, a crucial aspect of any resort, was underwhelming and looked as though it had been sitting out for far too long. The lack of freshness was abundantly clear, both in taste and presentation. Unfortunately, the resort's overall atmosphere did not compensate for its many shortcomings. The pool area was consistently crowded, with insufficient loungers for the number of guests. Consequently, we were forced to spend our relaxation time at the less-than-pristine beach, which was strewn with litter and sharp debris - quite a disappointing sight given the promising online photos of the resort landscape. Activities offered by The Azure Resort were few and far between, with the majority seeming unexciting and poorly organized. We attempted to participate in a yoga class, only to find that the room had not been prepared, and the instructor arrived late and frustrated. The resort's lack of attention to detail and guest experience made it difficult to find enjoyment in their offerings. Overall, our stay at The Azure Resort was a deeply disappointing experience. For a place that is supposed to be renowned for its exceptional service and stunning surroundings, it seemed as though management had become complacent and no longer concerned about the satisfaction of their guests. The disorganization, unkempt facilities, uninspired dining options, and lackluster activities made it difficult to find any redeeming qualities in our stay. I fear that The Azure Resort's days of glowing reviews may be waning, and unless drastic improvements are made, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this location to fellow travelers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Augusta Jane Evans, or Augusta Evans Wilson (May 8, 1835 - May 9, 1909), was an American author of Southern literature. She was the first woman to earn US100,000 through her writing. Wilson was a native of Columbus, Georgia, and her first book, Inez, a Tale of the Alamo, was written when she was still young. She was born Augusta Jane Evans on May 8, 1835, in Columbus, Georgia, the eldest child of the family. The area of her birth was then known as Wynnton (now MidTown). Her mother was Sarah S. Howard and her father was Matthew R. Evans. She was a descendant on her mother's side from the Howards, one of the most cultured families of Georgia. As a young girl in 19th-century America, she received little in the way of a formal education. However, she became a voracious reader at an early age. Her father suffered bankruptcy and lost the family's Sherwood Hall property in the 1840s. He moved his family of ten from Georgia for Alabama, and scarcely ten when they moved to San Antonio, Texas, in 1845. When the Mexican-American War had ended, and everything was in a disorganized condition, consequently there were no schools of any prominence. Had her mother not been cultivated and literary, Evans could never have obtained the education which fitted her for the work she later accomplished. During the Mexican war, San Antonio was the rendezvous for the United States troops sent to assist General Zachary Taylor, and the brilliant uniforms of the soldiery, the martial music, and the exciting events that accompany war, combined with the picturesque, enchanting scenery around San Antonio, furnished an excellent theme for Evans' first novel. In 1850, at the age of fifteen, she wrote Inez: A Tale of the Alamo, a sentimental, moralistic, anti-Catholic love story. It told the story of one orphan's spiritual journey from religious skepticism to devout faith. She presented the manuscript to her father as a Christmas gift in 1854. It was published anonymously in 1855. However, life in a frontier border town like San Antonio proved dangerous, especially with the Mexican-American War. By 1849, Evans' parents moved the family to Mobile, Alabama. She wrote her next novel, Beulah, at age 18; it was published in 1859. Beulah began the theme of female education in her novels. It sold well, selling over 22,000 copies during its first year of publication, a staggering accomplishment. It established her as Alabama's first professional author. Her family used the proceeds from her literary success to purchase Georgia Cottage on Springhill Avenue.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was she poor growing up?","completion":"Yes, Augusta Jane Evans experienced financial struggles growing up.

The car was likely to freeze that winter but the house was not because the Available options: (A). house had poor heating.; (B). car had poor heating.;","completion":"(B). car had poor heating. Living on the outskirts of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, lifelong residents Walter and Clara were no strangers to the harsh winters the Northland was notorious for. Their home, a charming farmhouse built in the 1920s by Walter's great-grandfather, was one of the few remaining original homesteads. The structure, as antiquated as it might be, proved itself impenetrable to the frosty onslaught year after year owing to the meticulous maintenance efforts by the couple. On the other hand, their car, an old patrol blue 1970 Chevy Impala, purchased by Walter in his youth, was not as resistant to the harsh freeze. Despite its strong American build and powerful engine, its heating system had been faltering over the years. Walter had been putting off fixing the car's heating for quite a while now. It was one of those tasks that always seemed to drown in the bucket of imminent chores. As another winter approached, the couple prepared their home and surroundings for the snowfall and icy temperature that were the hallmarks of a Minnesota winter. The radiators were refilled, and the fireplace was cleaned for the countless fires it would hold, emitting an ember glow amidst the cold sleep of winter. Clara made sure the woodshed was full to last them until spring. Stacks of logs were cut, dried, and stored. Each room had thick curtains to trap the heat, preventing it from gushing out the windows. When it came to the car, however, the task proved more daunting. The heaters had been showing signs of poor performance during the last winter and completely failed once the spring thaw had arrived. Neither Walter, with his handyman skills, nor Clara, with her relentless internet research, had been able to determine the root cause of the heat failure. They both knew that without a functioning heater, the car would likely freeze solid in the biting Minnesota winter. They feared the freezing of the car for many reasons. Despite its lack of modern creature comforts, the Chevy held sentimental value for Walter. Furthermore, it was a crucial asset for the retired couple. Trips to fetch supplies, visits to the doctor, and the occasional outing to the local saloon, all hinged on the operative state of their sturdy old Impala. Lastly, and more importantly, the car acted as a lifeline in many ways, especially during the winter months, when snow storms could make their home seem remote and desolate. As days passed, Walter and Clara noted with despair the falling temperatures, each day colder than the last. They knew they were racing against time. They reached out to family, friends, even mechanics across the country through phone calls, but despite numerous attempts, the Mystery of the Malfunctioning Heater carried on unsolved. Just as hope was on the verge of fading, the answer came from an unexpected source. Their ten-year-old grandson, who had learned about car engines in his remote school lessons, suggested that the problem might lie with the heater core, a critical part of the car's heating system. His theory was that the heater core, being clogged or leaking, might not be effectively transferring the engine's heat to warm up the car's interior. And so, they found their task for the remaining fall days before the freeze: cleaning and, if needed, replacing the heater core. As their handyman skills and hardness of resolve proved yet again, they restored the car heater to its original functioning just as the season's first snowflakes began to fall. Thus, as winter enveloped their world in white, the sturdy brick house and the old patrol blue Chevy stood, pushing back the frost. The house, with its reliable heating system, and the car, now boasting a fully functional heater, were ready to take on the icy cold breath of the Minnesota winter. They were a testament to human endurance and resilience in the face of elemental adversity. Both home and car – silent, steadfast warriors of the winter stood undeterred, unwilling to yield or freeze."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During his career, he was a ten-time All-Star, and named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. Drexler won an Olympic gold medal in 1992 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\\"The Dream Team\\") and an NBA Championship in 1995 with the Houston Rockets. He is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee (being inducted 2004 for his individual career, and in 2010 as a member of the \\"Dream Team\\") On February 14, 1995, with the Blazers out of serious contention for a championship, Portland honored Drexler's request to be traded to a contender and sent the Blazer great back home to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Otis Thorpe in mid-season, right before the trade deadline. Despite finishing the regular season with a record of 47-35, which placed the Rockets 6th out of 8 playoff teams in the Western Conference, Drexler and long-time friend Hakeem Olajuwon helped propel them to an improbable second consecutive championship in 1995, sweeping the Orlando Magic. In his third and final NBA Finals appearance, Drexler averaged 21.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game. During the 1995 NBA Playoffs, Drexler was ejected during a game between the Rockets and the Phoenix Suns by referee Jake O'Donnell, which allegedly stemmed from a personal feud between the two at the time. This would turn out to be the last NBA game O'Donnell would referee, as he was not assigned any further games in the playoffs that year, and eventually retired a few months later. In 1996, on ESPN's NBA Today, O'Donnell commented, \\"I wouldn't give Clyde Drexler much leeway because of the way he reacted with me all the time. I thought at times he would give cheap shots to people, and I just would not allow it.\\" On February 13, 2009, Drexler participated in the NBA All-Star Weekend's Celebrity Game.

Buddy Roemer, a longshot candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said at the Republican Leadership Conference Saturday that America is in the grips of \\"institutional corruption\\" due to the corrosive presence of special interest money in politics. \\"I've never seen anything like the tyranny that walks our land, the tyranny of the special interests that walks America today,\\" said Roemer, who is also a former congressman. He told a relatively subdued crowd of conservative activists that he has \\"seen the rigged money game grow and grow and grow.\\" \\"Political giving has mushroomed into a casino for favors for the special interests who live off government,\\" said Roemer, who said more money was given in the last presidential cycle by people in the Washington, D.C., area than in 32 states combined. \\"One percent of the people give the money, and they want a favor, an access, a help, a relief,\\" he added. Roemer took aim at politicians from both parties for their ties to special interest money, hitting President Obama for a refusal to lead on the issue \\"because he's busy running to Wall Street for a fundraiser for 35,000 bucks per ticket.\\" Members of Congress, he said, are too busy fundraising to do the work of governing. \\"They don't read the bills,\\" he said. \\"They don't have time to. They're working out lobbying jobs.\\" Roemer reiterated his vow not to take more than 100 from any one donor in order to avoid being elected by special interests. The tax code is \\"written by the lobbyists,\\" said Roemer, who advocates a modified version of the so-called \\"FairTax\\" flat sales tax. Calling the tax code \\"deliberately unreadable,\\" Roemer said, \\"it's a disgrace.\\" Roemer's speech included a call to reduce spending by one percent of Gross Domestic Product each year, and eliminate the Department of Energy and Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac. He complained about the impact of excessive regulations on small businesses - calling for all recent regulations to be reversed - and said America has gone from \\"a nation of makers\\" to \\"a nation of takers\\" from the government. Roemer also said if he is president U.S. military personnel will no longer \\"serve on oil duty\\" abroad.

Roemer thinks politicians spend a lot of time raising money instead of working on government. He criticized President Obama too, saying he doesn't do enough to fix this problem. Roemer promised that if he became president, he wouldn't take more than 100 from any one person, to show that he doesn't want politics to simply be about who has the most money. He also aimed at the tax code, which is something like the rule book for taxes. He thinks it's too hard to understand and that it should be simpler.

Paragraph: General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others.

Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services, and some only offer take-out and delivery. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments. - Object manipulation is a form of dexterity play or performance in which one or more people physically interact with one or more objects. Many object manipulation skills are recognised circus skills. Other object manipulation skills are linked to sport, magic, and everyday objects or practices. Many object manipulation skills use special props made for that purpose: examples include the varied circus props such as balls, clubs, hoops, rings, poi, staff, and devil sticks; magic props such as cards and coins; sports equipment such as nunchaku and footballs. Any other object can also be used for manipulation skills. Object manipulation with ordinary items may be considered to be object manipulation when the object is used out of its socially acknowledged context and used differently from its original purpose. - Philip Astley (8 January 1742 27 January 1814) was an English equestrian, circus owner, and inventor, regarded as being the \\"father of the modern circus\\". The circus industry, as a presenter of an integrated entertainment experience that includes music, domesticated animals, acrobats, and clowns, traces its heritage to Astley's Amphitheatre, a riding school that Astley founded in London following the success of his invention of the circus ring in 1768. - Clowns are comic performers who employ slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style. - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos. It consists of rounds of play cycling among: - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Dinner theater (sometimes called dinner and a show) is a form of entertainment that combines a restaurant meal with a staged play or musical. Sometimes the play is incidental entertainment, secondary to the meal, in the style of a sophisticated night club, or the play may be a major production with dinner less important, or in some cases, optional. Dinner theater requires the management of three distinct entities: a live theater, a restaurant, and usually, a bar. - A circus is a company of performers that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, unicyclists, as well as other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term 'circus' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Philip Astley is credited with being the 'father' of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The 'traditional' format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s. - A trapeze is a short horizontal bar hung by ropes or metal straps from a support. It is an aerial apparatus commonly found in circus performances. Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act. It is officially the last performance of the circus.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Introduces possible negatives for children to expect Product review: This is a lovely book until you get to the part that tells the child what negatives to expect and that the parent will always be there to help with negatives. It's enough with the targeted age group just to say, as the book does in the beginning, that you and God are there to guide and love him or her. But laying the ground to expect bad grades and mean teachers (just one example) is not productive. And saying that you will \\"always be on the child's side\\" sets the child up to believe that you don't think he or she will ever make a mistake or be wrong or deserve punishment or correction from you! Better just to say that you will be there to help. I was disappointed because this book has some very nice parts, but I would not read it to my grandchildren. Life is hard enough without setting them up to fail. Two thumbs down on this one. Good Night God is a much better book. Answer:","completion":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product for various reasons. Firstly, the reviewer highlights an issue in the content of the book, stating that it introduces potentially negative scenarios for children to expect in their lives, which may not be developmentally appropriate or necessary for the target age group. The reviewer emphasizes that they believe it would be more suitable to focus only on the guidance and love aspects rather than introducing negative themes such as bad grades and mean teachers. This critique suggests that the book might not be an ideal choice for someone looking for an uplifting and positive story to read to children. Moreover, the reviewer expresses disappointment concerning the message of the book, stating that it could lead children to believe that they will never make mistakes or be wrong. This point indicates that the book might not be effective in promoting personal growth and self-awareness, which could be crucial for a young audience. Additionally, the reviewer shares their personal experience by stating that they would not read this book to their grandchildren, suggesting that it might not be appropriate for other families as well. This subjective perspective adds an extra layer of caution for potential buyers who may be considering this book for their own children or grandchildren. Lastly, the reviewer offers a comparison by mentioning an alternative book – \\"Good Night God\\" – as a much better option. By providing a concrete suggestion for another, more suitable book, the reviewer might further discourage potential buyers from purchasing the original product. In conclusion, this review would decrease the chances of someone buying the product due to its focus on potentially inappropriate content, criticism of the book's messages, personal experience of the reviewer, and suggestions for an alternative. The review brings the negative aspects of the book to light and warns potential purchasers about its potential pitfalls in raising and educating children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Tinariwen (Tamasheq: , with vowels , pronounced tinariwen \\"deserts\\", plural of tenere \\"desert\\") is a Grammy Award-winning group of Tuareg musicians from the Sahara Desert region of northern Mali. The band was formed in 1979 in Tamanrasset, Algeria, but returned to Mali after a cease-fire in the 1990s. The group first started to gain a following outside the Sahara region in 2001 with the release of The Radio Tisdas Sessions, and with performances at Festival au Desert in Mali and the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Their popularity rose internationally with the release of the critically acclaimed Aman Iman in 2007. Context: Tinariwen was founded by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, who at age four witnessed the execution of his father (a Tuareg rebel) during a 1963 uprising in Mali. As a child he saw a western film in which a cowboy played a guitar. Ag Alhabib built his own guitar out of a tin can, a stick and bicycle brake wire. He started to play old Tuareg and modern Arabic pop tunes. Ag Alhabib first lived in Algeria in refugee camps near Bordj Badji Mokhtar and in the deserts around the southern city of Tamanrasset, where he received a guitar from a local Arab man. Later, he resided with other Tuareg exiles in Libya and Algeria. In the late 1970s, Ag Alhabib joined with other musicians in the Tuareg rebel community, exploring the radical chaabi protest music of Moroccan groups like Nass El Ghiwane and Jil Jilala; Algerian pop rai; and western rock and pop artists like Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Carlos Santana, Dire Straits, Jimi Hendrix, Boney M, and Bob Marley. Ag Alhabib formed a group with Alhassane Ag Touhami and brothers Inteyeden Ag Ablil and Liya Ag Ablil in Tamanrasset, Algeria to play at parties and weddings. Ag Alhabib acquired his first real acoustic guitar in 1979. While the group had no official name, people began to call them Kel Tinariwen, which in the Tamashek language translates as \\"The People of the Deserts\\" or \\"The Desert Boys.\\" In 1980, Libyan ruler Muammar al-Gaddafi put out a decree inviting all young Tuareg men who were living illegally in Libya to receive full military training. Gaddafi dreamed of forming a Saharan regiment, made up of the best young Tuareg fighters, to further his territorial ambitions in Chad, Niger, and elsewhere. Ag Alhabib and his bandmates answered the call and received nine months of training. They answered a similar call in 1985, this time by leaders of the Tuareg rebel movement in Libya, and met fellow musicians Keddou Ag Ossade, Mohammed Ag Itlale (aka \\"Japonais\\"), Sweiloum, Abouhadid, and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. All sang and played guitar in various permutations. The musicians joined together in a collective (now known as Tinariwen) in order to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people, built a makeshift studio, and vowed to record music for free for anyone who supplied a blank cassette tape. The resulting homemade cassettes were traded widely throughout the Sahara region. In 1989, the collective left Libya and moved to Ag Alhabib's home country of Mali, where he returned to his home village of Tessalit for the first time in 26 years. In 1990 the Tuareg people of Mali revolted against the government, with some members of Tinariwen participating as rebel fighters. After a peace agreement known as the Tamanrasset Accords was reached in January 1991, the musicians left the military and devoted themselves to music full-time. In 1992 some of the members of Tinariwen went to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire to record a cassette at JBZ studios. They played occasional gigs for far-flung Tuareg communities throughout the Sahara region, gaining word-of-mouth popularity among the Tuareg people. Question: Were there other members in the group or was it a solo act? Answer:","completion":"Tinariwen was founded as a group, not a solo act. It was formed by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, who later joined forces with other musicians such as Alhassane Ag Touhami, Inteyeden Ag Ablil, Liya Ag Ablil, Keddou Ag Ossade, Mohammed Ag Itlale (aka \\"Japonais\\"), Sweiloum, Abouhadid, and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. These musicians came together in a collective to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people. Throughout the years, Tinariwen has had a fluid lineup consisting of various members who contributed to their music and performances. So, Tinariwen was not a solo act but rather a collective group of Tuareg musicians working together with a shared goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A: Answer:","completion":"The most efficient possible engine is called the Carnot Engine, named after its inventor, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, a French physicist and engineer. The Carnot engine is a theoretical, reversible heat engine that operates using the principles of the Carnot cycle and achieves the maximum efficiency determined by the temperature difference between its heat source and its heat sink based on the laws of thermodynamics. Carnot's theorem states that the efficiency of any heat engine is always less than or equal to the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between the same temperature limits. This means that the Carnot engine serves as an ideal standard against which the performance of real engines can be compared. The efficiency of the Carnot engine can be represented by the equation: Efficiency = 1 - (T_c / T_h) Where T_h is the temperature of the heat source (the hot reservoir) and T_c is the temperature of the heat sink (the cold reservoir), measured in Kelvin. This equation shows that the maximum efficiency depends only on the temperature difference between the input (heat source) and the output (heat sink) of the engine. However, it's important to note that the Carnot engine is an idealized and theoretical concept, and it is not possible to create a real engine that would reach this perfect efficiency. This is because actual engines are subject to various sources of dissipation and energy loss, such as mechanical friction, heat conduction, and other irreversible processes. Despite its theoretical nature, the Carnot engine plays a crucial role in the study and development of more efficient engines, as it represents the upper limit of efficiency that any heat engine can ever achieve. Engineers and researchers use the principles of the Carnot cycle and the concept of the Carnot engine to improve the performance and efficiency of real-world engines, such as internal combustion engines and steam turbines, ultimately working towards creating more sustainable and energy-efficient technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During his recovery from a heart attack late in 1955, he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP's potential candidates; the group, in addition to his doctor, concluded a second term was well advised, and he announced in February 1956 he would run again. Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition. He personally favored Robert B. Anderson, a Democrat, who rejected his offer; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party. In 1956, Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide, with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6% of the popular vote.

(CNN) -- Mitt Romney won all three of Tuesday's Republican presidential primaries, putting more distance between himself and his closest contender, Rick Santorum, who indicated he plans to fight on to his home state of Pennsylvania and beyond. Romney's wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide delegate lead that he holds over the other major GOP presidential candidates, according to CNN estimates.

His earliest and strongest musical influence was Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist. Byrd was best known for his association with Brazilian music, especially bossa nova. In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music. - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students. - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927 June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - Jazz Samba is a bossa nova album by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd released by Verve Records in 1962. \\"Jazz Samba\\" signaled the beginning of the bossa nova craze in America. Stan Getz was the featured soloist and the tracks were arranged by Charlie Byrd, who had first heard bossa nova during a tour of Brazil in 1961. - Frederick Eugene John \\"Gene\\" Lees (February 8, 1928 April 22, 2010) was a Canadian music critic, biographer, lyricist, and former journalist. Lees worked as a newspaper journalist in his native Canada before moving to the United States, where he was a music critic and lyricist. His lyrics for Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Corcovado\\" (released as \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\"), have been recorded by such notable singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Queen Latifah, and Diana Krall. Lees married his wife Janet in 1971. - \\"Desafinado\\", a Portuguese word (usually rendered into English as \\"Out of Tune\\", or as \\"Off Key\\"), is the title of a bossa nova song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics (in Portuguese) by Newton Mendonça. The English language lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks and \\"Jessie Cavanaugh\\" (a pseudonym used by The Richmond Organisation). Another English lyric, more closely based on the original Portuguese lyric (but not a translation) was written by Gene Lees, and appears on some recordings as well. The version by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd (from the album \\"Jazz Samba\\") was a major hit in 1962, reaching number 15 and number 4 on \\"Billboard\\"s pop and easy-listening charts, respectively; their definitive rendering also reached number 11 in the UK, while Ella Fitzgerald's version made number 38. The song was voted by the Brazilian edition of \\"Rolling Stone\\" as the 14th greatest Brazilian song. - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content. - Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \\"horn-like\\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. - Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim (January 25, 1927December 8, 1994), also known as Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, pianist, songwriter, arranger and singer. He was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists within Brazil and internationally. - Jon Hendricks (born September 16, 1921) is an American jazz lyricist and singer. He is considered one of the originators of vocalese, which adds lyrics to existing instrumental songs and replaces many instruments with vocalists (such as the big-band arrangements of Duke Ellington and Count Basie). Furthermore, he is considered one of the best practitioners of scat singing, which involves vocal jazz soloing. For his work as a lyricist, jazz critic and historian Leonard Feather called him the \\"Poet Laureate of Jazz\\", while \\"Time\\" dubbed him the \\"James Joyce of Jive\\". Al Jarreau has called him \\"pound-for-pound the best jazz singer on the planetmaybe that's ever been\\". - The Composer of Desafinado , Plays is the debut album by Antônio Carlos Jobim , released in 1963 .

Review: I bought this printer with my laptop just over a year ago and I have never successfully printed anything. Unfortunately, I bought it while overseas and didn't even open it until the 1 year warranty had almost expired. I've plugged it in twice and, after several incredibly frustrating calls to the support line, have finally been told that the mechanism must not be working and I should buy a new printer... one month after the warranty expired. I was appalled by the customer service, or lack thereof, and will never again purchase an HP product for home use. If I could have given this product 0 stars, that would have been more accurate as 0 is exactly how many things I've been able to print. My recommendation would be to buy anything else... even a pen would be a more efficient printing method. Answer: Select from: 1). No 2). Yes The answer is:","completion":"1).

Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten.

Fact 2: For flowering plants, the answer is the Flower. Given the two facts above, what do flowers respond to? Answer:","completion":"Flowers respond to a variety of environmental cues and internal signals, including daily and seasonal cycles, as well as diseases. These factors play a crucial role in the growth, development, and reproductive success of flowering plants. Some of the key factors that flowers respond to are: 1. Photoperiodism: Flowers are sensitive to the length of day and night, which change with the seasons. This is known as photoperiodism, and it is a crucial factor in determining the timing of flowering. For example, some plants, known as long-day plants, flower when the day length is longer than a critical threshold, whereas others, known as short-day plants, flower when the day length is shorter than this threshold. 2. Temperature: Flowers respond to changes in temperature, which can also be influenced by the seasons. Temperature has a direct impact on the rate of plant growth and development. Some plants require a period of prolonged cold (vernalization) before they can flower, while others need warmer temperatures to initiate flowering. 3. Hormones: Flowers respond to internal hormonal signals, which play a crucial role in plant growth and development. One hormone called gibberellin stimulates flower initiation, while another hormone called abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits flowering. Additionally, a hormone called florigen has been proposed to serve as the long-range signal that triggers flowering in response to photoperiodic cues. 4. Disease: Flowers can also be affected by diseases, which can interfere with their normal growth and development. Pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, can attack floral tissues, leading to loss of reproductive potential. In response to disease, plants can activate defense mechanisms that limit the spread and impact of the pathogen. Overall, flowers respond to a complex combination of environmental and internal factors, including photoperiod, temperature, hormonal signals, and disease. This enables them to maximize their reproductive success and adapt to the ever-changing environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. ‘Under the Skin’ review: Scarlett Johansson mesmerizes in this moody sci-fi thriller “Under the Skin,” Glazer’s third film, offers new evidence of that promise, even if it doesn’t entirely deliver on it. As a speculative piece of fantasy and warily somber mood piece, this erotically charged thriller recalls Philip K. Dick, but in its finely calibrated formalism and vivid atmospherics, it’s pure Glazer. The story of “Under the Skin” — which was adapted from a novel by Michel Faber — doesn’t amount to all that much. But, true to its title and thanks to Glazer’s superb control and a mesmerizing performance by Scarlett Johansson, this creepy-cool exercise possesses a sinuous, insinuating power to burrow into the viewer’s consciousness and make itself felt for days on end. Felicitously enough, Johansson is already in theaters as the Marvel action heroine Black Widow; her character in “Under the Skin” could be called the same thing, albeit of an intergalactic provenance. After a prologue involving mysterious spheres, orbs and a whispered soundtrack of Johansson apparently practicing English phonetics, the film cuts to a lonely road in Scotland, where a leather-clad motorcyclist retrieves a female body from an isolated ditch. What this has to do with Johansson will all be made clear in “Under the Skin,” which will spend most of its time in the Scottish countryside, filmed by Glazer to maximize its inherently supernatural beauty; when Johansson’s character — let’s call her the Girl Who Fell to Earth — encounters a succession of local men in her generic-looking white van, the local accents begin to sound like their own alien tongue. As the ultimate fembot-fatale, Johansson is deceptively good in a role that demands sparkly, seductive animation one moment and dispassionate blankness the next. Just what her character is doing, and how that will or will not change her, provides the bare bones of a narrative that, while thin, can still be exploited for maximum aesthetic and even intellectual impact. With long, quiet takes in which he simply observes Johansson wordlessly taking in the world around her, Glazer infuses the everyday modern world with a surpassing sense of strangeness and doom. Even more fascinating is an emotional journey on the part of a heroine whose indifference to such feelings as pain, fear and empathy can be callous (witness an excruciating scene on a windswept beach) but, in another context, allows her to be non-judgmental of even the most dramatic human flaws. That encounter will propel the otherwise one-note plot of “Under the Skin” in a surprising and much more thoughtful direction. Once “Under the Skin” reaches its surprisingly affecting conclusion, it feels less like a cinematic novel than a well-executed short story. Viewers are likely to emerge from the film thinking, “More, please,” in the best sense of that phrase. It has taken almost ten years for Glazer to get from “Birth” to “Under the Skin”; with luck, he’ll be back sooner with his next film.

By explicitly stating that they asked officials in each agency, it demonstrates their commitment to ensuring the accuracy and credibility of the information presented. This active approach reinforces the hypothesis that they indeed talked to officials in each agency. Second, the premise establishes the specific purpose of communicating with the officials in each agency—verifying the accuracy of the information. This specificity aligns with the hypothesis that the focus of these conversations was on fact-checking and ensuring that the information presented was accurate. It demonstrates a strong connection between the researchers' actions and the hypothesis. Third, the use of the term \\"case illustrations\\" implies that these agencies were selected for profiling and were not a comprehensive list of all agencies. This suggests that the researchers or individuals involved were thorough in their investigation and selection process and chose these specific agencies for a reason. The hypothesis, \\"We talked to officials in each agency to verify information,\\" further emphasizes this point by showcasing their dedication to obtaining accurate information for each selected agency. Furthermore, the premise indicates a level of trust and cooperation between the individuals involved in creating the case illustrations and the officials in each agency. The willingness of officials to verify the accuracy of the information they presented demonstrates that they acknowledged the importance of portraying their agencies accurately. Consequently, this supports the hypothesis that they communicated directly with officials from each agency to achieve this goal. Lastly, the premise implies that the information was based on direct conversations with knowledgeable insiders from each agency. This direct interaction lends additional support to the hypothesis that they talked to officials to verify information, as it suggests that interacting with agency officials was an essential step in collecting and validating the data. In conclusion, if the premise \\"We also asked officials in each of the agencies profiled as case illustrations to verify the accuracy of the information presented on their respective agencies\\" is true, it strongly supports the hypothesis that \\"We talked to officials in each agency to verify information.\\" It demonstrates the researchers' active approach, purpose-driven communication, trust and cooperation with agency officials, and reliance on insider knowledge to gather and verify accurate information for the case illustrations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: May Day: workers of the world unite and take over - their factories A 19th-century slogan is getting a 21st-century makeover. The workers of the world really are uniting. At least, some of them are. The economic meltdown unleashed by the 2008 financial crisis hit southern Europe especially hard, sending manufacturing output plunging and unemployment soaring. Countless factories shut their gates. But some workers at perhaps as many as 500 sites across the continent – a majority in Spain, but also in France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey – have refused to accept the corporate kiss of death. Related: May Day 2015: share your photos and videos By negotiation, or sometimes by occupation, they have taken production into their own hands, embracing a movement that has thrived for several years in Argentina. In France, an average of 30 mostly small companies a year, from phone repair firms to ice-cream makers, have become workers’ co-operatives since 2010. Coceta, a co-operative umbrella group in Spain, reckons that in 2013 alone some 75 Spanish companies were taken over by their former employees – roughly half the total in the whole of Europe. A gathering in Marseille last year of representatives from worker-controlled factories drew more than 200 delegates from more than a dozen countries – including pioneers from Argentina, whose turn-of-the-century economic crash sparked a wave of fabricas recuperadas that today has left around 15,000 workers in charge at more than 300 workplaces. The fast-developing phenomenon is now a field of academic study; there are websites, such as workerscontrol.net and autogestion.coop, dedicated to it. No two self-managed ventures launch in the same circumstances, and many face daunting obstacles: bureaucratic inertia and administrative red tape that can delay or even prevent production; legal opposition from former owners; a still-chilly economic climate; outdated machinery, or products no longer in demand. Lifelong union militants can find themselves, for the first time in their lives, making tough commercial decisions. But many – for the time being at least – are making it work. Twenty minutes’ drive from the old port of Marseille, on a green and well-groomed industrial park outside the Provençal village of Gémenos, is Fralib, the largest tea factory in France. Every year, 250-odd workers here turned six tonnes of carefully cured leaves into more than 2bn sachets of Lipton and Eléphant brand flavoured and scented teas – lemon, mint, Earl Grey – and soothing herbal infusions: linden, camomile, verbena. But in September 2010, having spent five years steadily shifting half the factory’s production to Poland, its owner, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever, summarily announced it was closing the site. “It was … shocking,” said Olivier Lerberquier, a CGT union convenor at the factory. “Unilever France had just paid a huge dividend to shareholders. Fralib, this place, was profitable, even at half capacity. We decided to fight.” It has been, by any standards, a long battle, but it seems nearly over: next month, 57 ex-Fralib employees, now reformed into a self-managed workers’ co-op, will switch on their machines again, and a factory silent for half a decade will once more produce tea. Standing four-square in the cavernous main production hall at Gémenos, as long-underemployed operators checked pristine machinery and freshly trained technicians tested new quality-control equipment, Leberquier said few in France would have bet on the factory’s remaining workers getting this far. “In the end, though, the length of the fight – 1,336 days, it was – almost helped us,” he said. “We got time to build solidarity, and a solid business plan. And even if, like our lawyer says, we’re now ‘condemned to succeed’, at least we know, for sure, that we have as good a chance as anyone.” The workers also got money. Unilever submitted four successive redundancy plans for the 182 people still employed at Fralib in 2010. All – including one proposal to relocate to Poland on an annual salary of €6,000 – were thrown out by the employment tribunal in Marseille. While more than half the workers, exhausted, eventually accepted a payoff, those who held out to the end were rewarded: first, the greater Marseille authority, keen to preserve jobs, agreed to buy the factory site from Unilever for €5m and pay a symbolic extra euro for the machinery. Then in June last year, the company agreed a remarkable €20m settlement to cover compensation for all unpaid wages, retraining, market research, brand promotion – and €1.5m of startup capital for the new business. “I won’t lie – it was hard,” said Xavier Imbernou, a machine operator retraining in quality control and food safety. “We went months without pay; dug deep into our savings. Whole families suffered. But we had such support, from around the country. Our struggle became symbolic.” Marie Sasso, who has been filling little sachets with Eléphant tea – the brand was first made near Marseille St Charles station in 1896 – since she was 17, said she never expected to find herself without a job at 55, “and never for a moment considered not fighting for it”. She said she was “counting the days till the machines restart. All this time we’ve been maintaining them, running them once a month to see they’re working. This time, when they start, it’ll be for us. No bosses. That’s what kept us going.” The Société Coopérative et Participative Thés et Infusions, or SCOP-TI, as the new venture is known, failed in two of its early objectives: Unilever rejected its suggestion that the factory continue to supply it with bulk tea on contract, and it refused to surrender the Eléphant brand. “We had to rethink, radically,” said Leberquier. The co-op’s new plan has it processing 350 tonnes of tea and infusions this year and 500-600 tonnes by 2017: enough to pay its members a fair wage. It is negotiating contracts with French supermarkets to supply fairtrade teas under their own labels, but is also developing a more upmarket own-brand range. “These are premium, organic, local or regional products,” said Leberquier. “The south of France used to produce 400 tonnes of linden a year; now it mostly comes from Latin America and the harvest here is barely 15 tonnes a year. We’ve already signed deals that will bring Provençal orchards back to life.” The former Fralib workers’ road to self-management has involved almost everyone learning something new. “You have to realise: we did production,” said Gerard Cazorla, 57, along with Leberquier a leading light in the struggle, and recently elected president of the co-op. “Purchasing, transport, marketing, sales, distribution – all of that was Unilever’s responsibility.” Roles have been decided “democratically, and actually quite naturally”, he said, through a horizontal structure of frequent general assemblies and an elected (and instantly dismissable) 11-person managing board. Some debates – salaries all equal or reflecting professional expertise? – have been tougher than others, Cazorla conceded. And the more militant members of the new co-operative – among them, he would be the first to admit, himself – have had to adjust to some uncomfortable realities. There was disquiet, for example, at the necessity of working directly with France’s famously ruthless big supermarket chains, and soul-searching at the prospect of a self-employed sales team working essentially on commission. “We have to be pragmatic,” Cazorla said. “Sometimes I have to take my union cap off. We have a big factory to run and 60 salaries to pay. We’re not going to change society. There’s still going to be capitalism. But we try to do what we’re doing as best we can, and according to our values.” In a small green space tucked between tall apartment buildings, two teenage girls giggle self-consciously as they begin singing softly into their microphones. A crowd forms around them, clapping along as the videographer calls out instructions. This hastily formed band is recording a video tribute to their city’s music school, which for five years has offered drum, piano and band lessons, among others, to around 800 students in Mataró, a small city 20 miles from Barcelona. Most music schools wouldn’t elicit a tribute, but Mataró is different. In 2012, the school was on the brink of closure, a victim of changing political priorities and cutbacks driven by Spain’s economic crisis. As the school’s 40 teachers prepared for imminent unemployment, the students and their families took to the streets to demand that local authorities kept the school open. Finally a compromise was reached: the school would continue but its management would be privatised. With little to lose, the school’s teachers decided to bid for the contract. “We just threw it together,” said piano teacher Aradia Sánchez de la Blanca. “The motivation was so pressing and the rage over everything we had been through was so intense that we started going down this path without thinking too much about the next steps.” From this kneejerk reaction Musicop was born, a co-operative that marries together music education and co-operative values. Their elation at winning the tender soon gave way to panic. “We went from basically being teachers to being members in a co-op,” said Sánchez de la Blanca. “All of a sudden we had to think about how we were going to organise ourselves, manage our finances - this was new for most of us.” Most members had no idea what it meant to be in a co-op, said teacher Montse Anguera Gisbert. “The first year involved a lot of swearing,” she said laughing. The co-operative is now in its third year and despite the steep learning curve and the country’s economic crisis, it is growing. Today the co-op offers classes to nearly 2,000 students in seven municipalities, bringing music education to students who range from 36 months old to octogenarians. The backbone of their growing enterprise is their monthly assemblies, where everything from management to expansion opportunities is on the table. To meet their obligation, Musicop has taken on another 40 or so part-time workers. Once there is enough fulltime work for these workers, the hope is that they can become members of the co-operative. As Musicop’s members grapple with the challenges of self-management, they have relied extensively on the resources around them. About a year ago, Musicop set up offices in Can Fugarolas, a repurposed car dealership and repair shop that now serves as headquarters for several other co-ops dealing in everything from solar energy to consumer goods – along with other community groups. The city of Mataró boasts a rich history of co-operatives, said Ignasi Gómez, president of Musicop. “The first co-operative launched here in the late 1800s,” he said, citing a co-op dedicated to construction launched in 1887. “Co-operatives are part of the local culture on many levels.” Spain today is home to some 18,000 co-operatives, a vibrant movement whose international face has often been that of Mondragon, one of the world’s biggest workers’ co-operatives. Founded by local priests in the Basque country in the 1950s, Mondragon today employs nearly 75,000 people and racked up global sales of more than €11.6bn in 2013. “Mondragon offers inspiration on what’s possible,” said Paloma Arroyo, of Coceta, a group that represents co-operatives in Spain. In 2013 alone, she said, some 75 companies across Spain were turned into co-operatives by their workers, out of 150 companies across Europe. On a Friday afternoon, Musicop’s teachers were spread out across Mataró, offering classes in four places. In a quiet primary school, pianos had been crammed into a small room where three girls were learning to play the theme song from Frozen. Elsewhere, another teacher had his hands full with eight pre-schoolerslearning the basics of rhythm in a class called Music and Movement. In an abandoned school that hosts many of Musicop’s classes in Mataró, more than a dozen pre-teens sang and waved their hands in the air as they wandered around a room singing along to Vivaldi. For 16-year-old Aida Garcia, the classes offer a window into a world she would have never known otherwise. “I love being in these classes,” she said, adding that her dream was to play clarinet in an orchestra. Propelled by the enthusiasm of their students, Musicop’s members have pushed forward, even though salaries dropped by 30% initially. They have begun climbing back up, and are now about 12% shy of what they were before, said Gómez. “The salaries we make are respectable, but not ideal,” he added. Even so, few members hesitate when asked if it was worth it. “We’re better off today, because we’re empowered,” said Gómez. Marius Kostopoulos was painstakingly dripping lemon essential oil into the 300-odd plastic bottles that he and his three colleagues had spent the past hour or so filling with all-purpose liquid household cleaner. This was not the job he was taken on to do in 2004 at Viome, a once highly profitable manufacturer of building supplies – ceramic tile adhesives and grouts, to be precise – on the industrial outskirts of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second city. But Viome no longer really exists. Faced with the near-total collapse of the Greek construction industry, a consequent 40% slump in sales and a 30% increase in energy costs, its parent company, Philkeram-Johnson – majority owned by the local Philippou family– went spectacularly bust four years ago. Kostopoulos and his 45 fellow production workers were already working shorter hours. In May 2011, their pay cheques stopped coming (although they have never officially been made redundant, meaning they are deprived of even minimal Greek jobless benefits). Then in September that year, Philkeram-Johnson simply abandoned the site. So Kostopoulos and 20 of his colleagues are occupying its echoing, increasingly rundown machine halls and warehousing and – for the time being, at least – making a bit of money. “It certainly isn’t enough to survive on,” said Kostopoulos, whose wife, a daycare worker, is now at home looking after their 16-month-old son. “I need other work to get by, so I help out on evenings and weekends as a waiter at weddings, bar mitzvahs, that kind of thing. Other people’s festivities … But it’s up to half the €500 or €600 we live on each month. I couldn’t do without it.” When Philkeram-Johnson left, the workers’ first thought was to prevent the machinery and stock being taken by the company. If that disappeared, they feared, there would be no chance of them ever seeing the €1.5m they were owed in backpay and compensation. But what they really wanted, from the outset, was simply to keep working. “No one wants to be unemployed,” said Dimitris Koumatsioulis, 45, another ex-worker and founding co-operative member. “In Greece in particular, here and now, we couldn’t have another 45 workers unemployed, another 45 families deprived of an income.” At the very first of their general assemblies, a proposal to stay on in the factory and run it as a self-managed co-operative won 97% approval. A delegation of workers went to Athens for talks with the employment ministry; the Philippou family, majority owners of Philkeram-Johnson, made it clear they did not envisage restarting production on the site. By mid-2012 the Viome workers had contacted solidarity networks in Greece and abroad, exploring the possibility of producing a range of environmentally friendly soaps, washing-up liquids, softeners and detergents. The products had to be cheap to make, using existing machinery and raw materials that were simple to source. Local citizens’ associations and unions promised to distribute a proportion of the factory’s output, followed by many of the dozens of small co-operative stores and markets then starting to spring up around Greece as the country’s formal economy spiralled downwards. In February 2013, after a three-day solidarity event in Thessaloniki that included a benefit concert attended by more than 6,000 people, production at Viome restarted under the workers’ control, and in April last year a court recognised them as a legally constituted, not-for-profit social co-operative. Viome products are now sold through charity and solidarity networks in Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. Its co-operative statutes, which emphasise the key principles of collective decision-making and ownership, refer to the venture’s “solidarity supporters”: organisations and individuals who have pledged to purchase a percentage of the factory’s output every year. The co-operative has fought a series of court cases against Philkeram-Johnson and the Philippou family, who have repeatedly said they have no plans to use the factory themselves but now want to sell the land to pay off outstanding debts to banks, suppliers and employees. Greece’s new radical left government is considering legislation allowing workers to legally take over factories abandoned by their owners. But ultimately, said Koumatsioulis: “We don’t want to hide it: above and beyond our own jobs and our families’ futures, this is about equality, democracy, the whole employer-employee relationship.” If Viome eventually succeeded in its target of producing up to a tonne a day of soaps, detergents and cleaning fluids, said Kostopoulos, “we’ll be better off here – psychologically, politically, economically – than we ever were when we had bosses. We’re working for each other. That’s the difference”. All his life José Pereyra had been a waiter. For 20 years he served tables at Los Chanchitos (The Little Piggies), an old-style parrila (grill) at a strategic corner in Buenos Aires, on the borderline between two of the most densely populated middle-class neighbourhoods of the city. Specialising in finger-licking grilled pork and generous helpings of homemade pasta, and with a faithful clientele that had kept it in business for three decades, Pereyra expected Los Chanchitos to provide firm job security. But two years ago Pereyra realised its proprietors, who owned four other restaurants, were heading for a crash. “They owed rent on the building, they owed us back wages and had fallen behind on our social benefits payments,” said Pereyra. “I realised they were planning to close Los Chanchitos behind our backs.” In previous decades, there would have been little Pereyra could have done to save his own job and that of his 27 other co-workers. But after Argentina’s cataclysmic economic collapse in 2001, when the country defaulted on its massive foreign debt and the government impounded all bank savings accounts, so many firms went into bankruptcy that workers were forced to find innovative solutions to save their jobs. “Faced with the closures, instead of folding their arms and going home, many workers took the decision to form co-operatives,” said Andrés Quintana, spokesperson for CNCT, the National Confederation of Work Co-operatives.Worker-managed firms existed before the crash. “There are probably between 5,000 and 6,000 co-operatives in Argentina today,” said Quintana. “The largest growth has been in recent years.” They provide jobs for more than 60,000 people. For many, such as Pereyra, who worked the night shift at Los Chanchitos, forming a co-operative was a matter of survival. “I remember the date, 23 April 2013, I spent all afternoon wandering around trying to figure out what to do,” Pereyra recalled. “The owners were pulling out and we had to take a decision. That night I called together all the waiters and the rest of the staff and proposed forming a co-operative.” The restaurant’s employees kept the takings from that night and the next day, but when the meat and vegetable suppliers arrived, Pereyra took his first brave step. He informed the suppliers that the employees had taken over the restaurant and that daily deliveries would be paid in cash from then on. The switch is not an easy one. “It’s a very difficult process for workers,” said Quintana. “Some are suddenly thrust from behind the counter to putting on a suit and going to work out a deal with the bank.” “The first months were very rough, I was a traumatic wreck,” confessed Pereyra, 50. “But we had no other choice, our jobs were at stake. Many of us were over 45and would have had a hard time finding work again. For the first nine months I had to sleep at Los Chanchitos to get the business on its feet.” On a larger scale, the workers at the large Bernardi oil storage plant in the Dock Sud area of the port of Buenos Aires were forced to take the firm over after it went bankrupt as Argentina’s economy imploded 14 years ago. “It was a typical case of a company that collapsed during the 2001 crisis,” said José Sancha, of Decosur, the 30-member co-operative that now runs the formerly privately owned plant. Decosur stores gas oil, petrol and fuel oil that is unloaded from tankers arriving at Buenos Aires in its 42 tanks with a combined capacity of 39,000 cubic metres.“The first years were very tough,” Sancha recalled. “It’s an activity that requires meeting strict environmental norms, dealing with very diverse clients and securing the necessary concessions with the port authorities.” But once the switch had been completed, business blossomed for the new cooperative. “We have now expanded to include an adjacent lot owned by another firm and we have even put in a pipe that connects us directly to the Dock Sud power plant,” said Sancha. Decosur now pipes liquid fuel to the 775-megawatt plant that feeds electric energy to a large slice of Buenos Aires. Umbrella groups such as CNCT have stepped in to smooth the bumpy transition. “We provide training tools, we set up networks, many firms have fallen by the wayside,” said Quintana. “The most complicated part for us was the legal settlement with the previous owners,” said Pereyra, who continues waiting at tables despite his new business role. A pleasant surprise that followed after the co-operative took over was the return of many clients lost as the quality of the food dropped when the previous owners stopped reinvesting in the restaurant. “If you stop paying your cook on time and you lower the quality of the meat, the client notices straight away. But when they saw that things started improving after we took over they started coming back.” Unlike a normal business, which must turn a profit for its owner, a co-operative run by its workers tends to provide better conditions for its employees. “We don’t retire our older employees, we find other tasks for them,” Pereyera said. “One of us needed surgery which he couldn’t afford, for example. So we got together between us and decided that the co-operative would cover the operation, because he had been working at the restaurant for 20 years. As a matter of fact, he just had the operation yesterday. A normal business maybe wouldn’t have cared, but we did.” At a first glance, the workshop appears to be a run-of-the-mill textile factory. Long lines of knitting and weaving machines dominate the hall, while boxes filled with garments and colourful spindles of yarn are piled up in corners.But Özgür Kazova is not like any other factory in Turkey: the four workers perched over their tables, sewing, ironing and supervising the whirring machinery, do not answer to any bosses. Their struggle began in early 2013, when the owners of Kazova Textiles, Ümit and Mustafa Somuncu, put all 95 workers on leave after withholding their pay for several months, blaming poor business conditions. The workers were told they would receive all back-paylater, but upon their return they were informed by the company lawyer that everyone had been dismissed without compensation for “unaccounted absence from work”. “We were dumbstruck,” said Aynur Aydemir who worked at Kazova Textiles for more than eight years. “Up until then we had been working seven days a week, up to 10 hours a day. Business seemed to be thriving. It was hard to believe that the company was really too broke to pay us.” What was more, the owners dismantled all working machinery overnight and disappeared together with more than 100,000 finished jumpers and 40 tonnes of high-quality yarn, leaving the unpaid and now unemployed workers with knitting machines that were almost half a century old and did not work properly. At the end of April, a handful of the former Kazova Textiles employees set up a tent in front of the old factory in order to prevent the owners taking the remaining valuables inside. Undeterred by what they said were threats and intimidation from the owners and the police, their reluctant struggle grew into a full-blown political movement. “At first we were timid, because we had never been involved in any political movement before,” Serkan Gönüs, 42, explained. “We were scared, but little by little our confidence grew when we saw how much support we had from bystanders during those demonstrations.” In the aftermath of Turkey’s protests in the spring of 2013, the workers decided to occupy and reopen the factory. A court ruled that the machines should go to the workers in compensation for their lost wages, and Muzaffer Yigit, 43, who has worked for Kazova Textiles since 1990, set out to repair them. Using the yarn that the old owners had left behind, the first jumpers, branded Diren Kazova (Resist Kazova), were produced. In September, the group hosted its first public fashion show. But discord led to a split, and four workers decided to found the co-operative Free Kazova. “We found that it was not enough to just talk about workers’ rights and resistance in theory,” Gönüs said. “We wanted to come up with a sustainable model for fairer work, and be able to support ourselves.” The Free Kazova workers have reached out to other self-managed factories and co-operatives worldwide in order to share experiences and expertise. Their aim is to produce high-quality, affordable garments for everyone interested in supporting a labour model that presents an alternative to exploitative wage work, with customers being told exactly how the money paid for each jumper is used. “We don’t want to work for a profit, just enough for all of us to get by,” Aynur Aydemir said. “We work six hours a day, and we like coming to work in the morning now, because we are our own bosses.” She added that Özgür Kazova jumpers were now sold not only in Turkey, but in France, Italy and Poland. “It’s actually hard to keep up with demand,” she laughed. “It proves that we are on the right track, and that many people agree with us and what we are defending.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The article discusses the rising trend among workers across the globe who are taking ownership and control of their factories when corporate owners decide to shut them down.

Over the last few decades men’s incomes have been slowly declining and women’s have been rising. Last year one in five men were not working, something economists call the biggest social crisis we will face. Party this is because the economy is changing quickly, but men aren’t. As the manufacturing economy gets replaced by a service and information economy, men are failing to adjust or get the skill they need to succeed. Meanwhile, women are moving in the opposite direction: In 2009 they became the majority of the American workforce for the first time ever. Now in every part of America young single women under 30 have a higher median income than young men, which is really important because that’s the phase of life when people imagine what their future will look like. As one sorority girl put it to me — remember, I said sorority, not someone from the women’s study center — “Men are the new ball and chain.” It’s the end of men because men are failing in schools and women are succeeding.

Adapted from her opening statement at the Munk Debate, “Resolved: Men Are Obsolete,” held in Toronto. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the idea that men are becoming obsolete due to various economic, social, and cultural changes happening around the world. The author, Hanna Rosin, presents five reasons to support this claim: 1. Men are failing in the workplace. Men's incomes have been declining while women's have been rising. As the manufacturing economy is replaced by service and information economies, men are failing to adjust or get the skills they need to succeed. 2. The traditional male breadwinner model is vanishing. Women are now marrying down, meaning marrying men with worse prospects than they have. Alpha wives, women who make more money than their husbands or boyfriends, are becoming more common. 3. The end of men can be seen in the working and middle classes. Men lose their jobs and lose their will to be fathers, and women take on all responsibilities alone, creating a virtual matriarchy in the parts of the country that used to be bastions of macho country music-style values. 4. Men have lost their monopoly on violence and aggression. Women are becoming more sexually confident, more aggressive and violent in both good ways and bad - going to war, going to jail, and physically fighting. 5. Men are now obsessed with their body hair. Men have adopted traditionally feminine concerns about grooming and appearance, as seen in the meticulously groomed chest of Anthony Weiner. Rosin suggests that men must adapt to these changes by keeping the aspects of manhood they like while adjusting the parts that are holding them back."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Waste products are deposited in the blood - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder A:","completion":"The final step of the process outlined above involves the elimination of the urine from the bladder through the process called micturition or urination. Here's a detailed explanation of the step: 1. Urine storage and preparation for elimination: After urine production in the kidneys, it is transported to the bladder via the ureters, which are muscular tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder. The bladder serves as a temporary storage organ for urine. As the bladder fills up with urine, its walls expand to contain the increasing volume, and specialized nerves in the bladder wall sense the stretching and produce an urge to urinate. 2. Activation of the micturition reflex: This urge to urinate increases as the bladder reaches its maximum capacity, ultimately triggering the micturition reflex. This reflex involves the activation of both the involuntary and voluntary nervous systems. The involuntary nervous system initiates the contraction of the detrusor muscle (a smooth muscle layer in the bladder wall) when the bladder is full and the internal urethral sphincter (an involuntary smooth muscle ring) around the neck of the bladder relaxes. 3. Voluntary control over urination: Alongside the automatic micturition reflex, individuals have voluntary control over urination through the relaxation and contraction of the external urethral sphincter. The external urethral sphincter is a circular ring of skeletal muscle surrounding the urethra and is under an individual's conscious control. Once a person decides it is an appropriate time and place to urinate, the brain sends signals to this muscle to relax. 4. Urine elimination: With voluntary relaxation of the external urethral sphincter and the contraction of the detrusor muscle, urine is forced through the urethra. The urethra is the tube that leads from the bladder to the exterior of the body. In males, the urethra is longer and passes through the prostate gland and the penis, while in females, it is shorter and opens in front of the vaginal opening. As urine flows through the urethra, it carries the waste products away from the body, completing the process. In summary, the final step in this process is the elimination of urine from the bladder through the urethra during the act of micturition or urination. This step involves a combination of involuntary muscle contractions (in the detrusor muscle and internal urethral sphincter) and voluntary control over the external urethral sphincter, ultimately leading to the expulsion of urine and waste products from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"While the phrase \\"These are lists of the busiest airports in the United States.\\" provides an indication that there are lists available to identify the busiest airports in the US, it does not directly answer the question or provide sufficient information about which specific airport holds the title as the busiest. A more detailed and comprehensive answer would be: The Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is currently considered the busiest airport in the United States. This designation is based on the total number of passengers and aircraft movements. Located in Atlanta, Georgia, it serves as a major hub for domestic and international flights, connecting the US to a multitude of global destinations. In 2020, the airport handled more than 42 million passengers, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a significant decrease in air travel. This figure is based on data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Airports Council International (ACI). Moreover, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport is not only the busiest airport in the United States but also holds the distinction of being the busiest airport in the world. It has held this title for over two decades, largely due to its strategic location and accessibility, as well as the airline presence. The airport serves as a major hub for Delta Air Lines, which is one of the largest airlines globally, operating more than 1,000 daily flights from Atlanta alone. Despite being the busiest airport in the US, the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has consistently demonstrated high efficiency, with its operational system and infrastructure designed to handle a large volume of passengers and aircraft movements seamlessly. Furthermore, other airports in the United States, such as Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), and Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), follow closely behind ATL in terms of traffic but have not surpassed it. In conclusion, the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is the busiest airport in the United States, based on both passenger traffic and aircraft movements.

Pain during urination and a need to go frequently and urgently are the main early signs of a UTI. If you notice these symptoms in yourself or someone in your care, schedule an appointment with a health care provider right away. You may feel the urgent need to urinate, but only pass a very small amount. Urine may appear cloudy, pink, red, or dark brown with a UTI. If you notice that your urine, or the urine of someone in your care, has an unusual appearance, schedule a visit with a healthcare provider. If you are using a catheter, hold the bag up to the light to check if it is clear. If you see cloudy residue, this may be a sign of a urinary tract infection in its early stages. If you have a UTI, your urine may smell strong or unpleasant. See a doctor if you notice that your urine smells bad, particularly if the smell is accompanied by other symptoms of infection (such as pain during urination or discolored urine). Some foods, like asparagus, can also affect the odor of your urine. For women, a UTI may cause pain in the center of the pelvis, in the area of the pubic bone. Pelvic pain can also be a sign of some other serious condition. Schedule an appointment with your doctor if you or someone in your care experiences pelvic pain. UTIs in their early stages may cause a variety of other symptoms in the elderly, some of which may mimic other conditions. Schedule an appointment with a health care provider if you notice: Confusion. Light-headedness. Pale skin. A low-grade fever.

Tämä tarkoittaa, että ehdotetun laajennuksen loppuminen ajoittuu samaan ajankohtaan, jolloin on odotettavissa, että Euroopan komissio päättää EU:n rahoituksen rokoteohjelmalle, joka pyrkii kitkemään raivotautia villieläimistä tietyissä jäsenmaissa. Näin ollen on järkevää, että nämä kaksi tapahtumaa ovat samankaltaisia ajallisesti, jotta voidaan varmistaa johdonmukaisuus ja tehokkuus taistelussa tätä tautia vastaan. Raivotauti on vakava ja usein kuolemaan johtava virustauti, joka vaikuttaa keskushermostoon ja leviää yleensä syljen välityksellä. EU on sitoutunut torjumaan tätä tautia villieläimissä rokoteohjelman avulla, joka perustuu rokotteiden levittämiseen esimerkiksi riistanruokintapaikoille, jotta mahdollisimman moni eläin saavutetaan ja rokotetaan. Tämänkaltaiset ohjelmat ovat olleet tehokkaita monissa maissa, ja niiden avulla on saatu vähennettyä raivotaudin esiintyvyyttä huomattavasti. Ehdotetun laajennuksen päättymisen ja EU-rahoituksen loppumisen yhteensovittaminen on tärkeää, jotta voidaan arvioida ohjelmien tehokkuutta ja päättää niiden jatkamisesta mahdollisimman hyvin informoitujen päätösten pohjalta. Lisäksi se antaa jäsenvaltioille mahdollisuuden valmistautua rahoituksen loppumiseen ja pohtia vaihtoehtoisia rahoitusmalleja, mikäli tällaiset raivotautirokoteohjelmat osoittautuvat edelleen tarpeellisiksi. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että ehdotetun laajennuksen päättymisen ajoitus on tärkeä osatekijä EU:n pyrkimyksissä torjua raivotautia sen jäsenvaltioissa. Tämä antaa mahdollisuuden arvioida rokotusohjelmien tehokkuutta ja tehdä tarvittavia päätöksiä niiden jatkamisesta, samalla kun jäsenvaltiot voivat valmistautua EU-rahoituksen loppumiseen ja miettiä vaihtoehtoisia rahoitusvaihtoehtoja tulevaisuudessa."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

People say he's the salt of the earth. He'd never pour salt on a wound, or make someone feel worse about something. However, sometimes he tells us a story that seems bigger than life. So we have to take it with a grain of salt. My husband makes enough money to support our family. So we say he brings home the bacon. He can cut the mustard, or do what is expected of him at work. Besides, he stands almost two meters tall, so it's easy to find my husband in a crowd. He is a tall drink of water. I take the train to work. It is not a pleasant ride because the train is so crowded that we are packed like sardines. When we fail to see problems at work, my boss tells us to wake up and smell the coffee.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly. I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me.

A hydrocarbon that doubles its carbon atoms will cause an decrease or increase in the amount of isomers? The answer is:","completion":"An increase in the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon will cause an increase in the number of isomers. To understand this, let us first delve into what hydrocarbons and isomers are, and how they are related to each other. Hydrocarbons are compounds consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Carbon atoms can form four covalent bonds with other atoms, while hydrogen atoms can form one covalent bond. Hydrocarbons are classified into two main categories: aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be further divided into three subcategories—alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes—based on the type of carbon-carbon bonds they have (single, double, or triple bonds, respectively). Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula, meaning they have the same number of constituent atoms, but with differing arrangements of atoms. There are two types of isomers: structural isomers, which differ in the order that atoms are bonded, and stereoisomers, which contain the same order of atom bonding but differ in the spatial arrangement of the atoms. Structural isomers can be further divided into chain isomers, position isomers, and functional group isomers. As the number of carbon atoms increases in a hydrocarbon, the number of possible isomers also increases. This is because there is a greater potential for different arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms within the molecule. For example, with only one carbon atom, there is only one possible hydrocarbon, methane (CH4). However, when the number of carbon atoms increases to three (e.g., in the case of propane, C3H8), two isomers are possible: propane and cyclopropane. As we go further along the carbon atom chain, the number of possible isomers increases exponentially. When a hydrocarbon doubles its carbon atoms, the increased complexity resulting from the additional carbon atoms allows for more unique arrangements of atoms within the molecule, thereby leading to an increase in the number of isomers. This increase in isomer quantity can have significant implications on the physical and chemical properties of the different isomers, including boiling and melting points, solubility, and reactivity. In summary, as the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon increases, so does the number of possible isomers. This relationship holds true when a hydrocarbon doubles its carbon atoms: there will be an increase in the amount of isomers due to the greater potential for differing arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms within the molecule. Overall, the study of isomers is crucial in understanding the diverse properties and behaviors of hydrocarbons and their myriad applications in chemistry, biology, and industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which friend hadn't taken enough calcium? Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia. Hint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Answer:","completion":"Greg is the friend who hadn't taken enough calcium, as he had hypocalcaemia. This condition occurs due to inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes, which is the opposite of Danny's condition, hypercalcaemia, which is characterized by excessive calcium levels."},{"prompt":"A young woman was at the cinema,and she was enjoying the film very much.In the next seat there was an old man,and he began looking on the floor under him.The woman was angry and whispered ,\\"What are you doing now?

Movie plot title: Mysterious Island Movie plot: In 1865 during the American Civil War, a massive storm sweeps through a Confederate prison camp. Union soldiers Cyrus Harding (Michael Craig), Herbert Brown (Michael Callan) and Neb (Dan Jackson) are planning an escape via a gas balloon tethered next to the compound. When a new prisoner, Union war correspondent Gideon Spillet (Gary Merrill), is brought into their cell, they knock out the guards and escape from the prison house. Once they arrive at the balloon, they drag one of the Confederate guards named Pencroft (Percy Herbert) aboard. After he explains that he knows how to pilot the balloon, they let him join the group. The balloon carries them westwards across the U.S., and it isn't long before they discover that they are over the Pacific Ocean. A storm arises; the balloon tears open and leaks a significant amount of gas, forcing it into descending and eventually running aground near the shore of an unknown island. The following morning the men reunite and begin to explore the strange island they find themselves upon. They discover that the island has lush tropical jungles, harsh plains, and many volcanoes which frequently erupt. When they reach the other side of the island, they encounter a monstrous crab. After Neb is nearly killed, the castaways are able to push it into a boiling geyser and have crab meat for dinner. Afterwards, the men continue exploring and find a herd of wild goats which they try to catch. Then they find two unconscious English ladies, Lady Mary Fairchild (Joan Greenwood) and her niece Elena (Beth Rogan), who were shipwecked here by the same storm. Working together, the castaways find cover and protection in a cave which they call \\"Granite House\\", formerly inhabited by a now deceased castaway named Thomas Ayrton.

The battle that took place on 26 July 1566 during the Northern Seven Years' War and was a slight victory for a Swedish fleet over a combined Danish and Lübecker fleet. It began just east of Öland and the Allied fleet eventually retreated toward Gotland. Two days after the battle a storm sank fourteen of the Allied ships while they were anchored near Visby, drowning around 5900 men. The Swedish fleet, further out to sea, returned to port with some damage. On 25 July, Horn discovered the Allied Danish-Lübeck fleet at the northern tip of Öland, headed for Gotland. Horn, who had a headwind, decided to avoid battle, but when the wind turned he started the battle on the morning of 26 July. A few more losses did not affect either fleet, when a sudden wind made it impossible for the Swedish navy to continue its pursuit of the Danish fleet, which was anchored to the Gotland coast to bury the Danish vice-admiral Christopher Morgisen on hallowed ground after his death from a cannonball. Shortly after that a sudden storm broke out. The Swedish navy, which was at sea, survived without major losses, other than having had to fell the main mast of the Hector, and was able to flee to Älvsnabben by 6 AUgust. The Allied fleet however was thrown against the coast of Gotland, and 12 Danish and 3 Lübeck vessels were smashed, and most of the ships' crews, numbering around 5000, were drowned, with only around 1400 surviving ashore.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Rarities is a compilation album by Australian rock band The Living End . The album features demos and acoustic versions of songs that were previously unreleased , and was first available on a range of online music stores for 5 days from 15 to 19 November 2008 , at which point it was taken off the stores for no confirmed reason . The album was exclusively released online , until its physical release as part of a 2 × CD deluxe edition of the band 's fifth studio album , White Noise , which was released on 27 February 2009 . - Scott Bradley Owen (born 14 February 1975) plays the double bass in the Australian punk rock/psychobilly band The Living End. - The double bass or simply the bass (and numerous other names) is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra. It is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than sounding to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff. The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a viol), rather than fifths, with strings usually tuned to E, A, D and G. The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family. - The Living End are an Australian punk rock band, which formed in 1994. Since 2002 the line up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals) and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and \\"State of Emergency\\" (4 February 2006). They have also gained chart success in the United States and United Kingdom. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Christopher John Cheney (born 2 January 1975) is an Australian rock musician, record producer and studio owner. He is the founding mainstay guitarist, songwriter and lead vocalist of the psychobilly band, The Living End, which was formed in 1994 with school mate Scott Owen. Cheney wrote the group's top 20 hits on the ARIA Singles Chart: \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\" (1997), \\"All Torn Down\\" (1999), \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" (2000), \\"Roll On\\" (2001), \\"One Said to the Other\\" (2003), \\"What's on Your Radio\\" (2005), \\"Wake Up\\" (2006) and \\"White Noise\\" (2008). In 2004 Cheney joined the super group The Wrights which put out a cover version of Stevie Wright's epic 11-minute track, \\"Evie\\" as a single. At the APRA Awards of 2009 Cheney won 'Song of the Year' for writing The Living End's track, \\"White Noise\\". In 2005 he married Emma, the couple have two daughters and are co-owners of a recording facility, Red Door Studios. In 2011 the Cheney family relocated to Los Angeles. - Andrew Douglas Strachan (born 20 August 1974) is an Australian rock musician. In 1994, after growing up in Adelaide, he relocated to Melbourne where in 2000 he became the drummer of alternative rock group, Pollyanna. In 2002, he joined fellow alternative rockers, The Living End, they have issued four Top 5 albums on the ARIA Charts, \\"Modern Artillery\\" (No 3 in 2003), \\"State of Emergency\\" (No. 1 in 2006), \\"White Noise\\" (No. 2 in 2008) and \\"The Ending Is Just the Beginning Repeating\\" (No. 3 in 2011). - \\"Prisoner of Society\\" is a song by The Living End. The song was originally released in Australia on the 1997 EP \\"Second Solution/Prisoner of Society\\".

These drivers just drove slowly, taking their own sweet time, as if they had nothing to do and no place in particular to go. Thus, the expression, \\" _ \\", was born. Consequently, a Sunday driver wasn't necessarily someone who was driving on a Sunday. A person could be a Sunday driver any day of the week. _ . The expression probably came about because there was a time when people would often decide to go for a relaxing drive on Sunday afternoons. A Sunday drive was a common occurrence years ago and especially on a nice warm sunny day. There were no stores open on Sunday because of the \\"blue laws\\", so you needed to be sure and fill up the gas tank and make any other needed purchases before Sunday arrived.

Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \\"coalition of the willing\\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \\"smoking guns\\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \\"major combat operations\\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN–USA Today–Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \\"democratization\\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.

New York (CNN) -- This weekend's Iraqi election is testing the strength of the nation's young democracy and could be a turning point in the history of the Middle East, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. In the March 7 election, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's coalition in the Iraqi parliament is seeking to win enough votes to keep him in office for another term. On Thursday, a series of insurgent attacks led to the deaths of 29 people in the city of Baquba. Zakaria said the election could have a lasting impact: \\"It might be the turning point in the rise of Iraq in the Middle East. Iraq is one of the largest, most important countries in the Arab world. It has the third or fourth largest petroleum reserves in the world. Even now it has 40 billion in oil revenues every year; it has a well-trained army thanks to the Americans. So what","completion":"happens in this election will not only shape the future of Iraq but also potentially redefine its role and influence in the region and beyond. With stakes so high, both domestic and international players are closely monitoring the electoral outcome. For the United States and its coalition partners, a stable, democratic, and reliable Iraq is crucial to their interests in maintaining regional security and countering the increasing influence of Iran. Additionally, the ongoing conflict in neighboring Syria only adds to the importance of Iraq becoming regional stability. Iraq shares a large border with Syria, and a stable Iraqi government is essential to prevent the spillover of the Syrian conflict into the broader region. As the world watches, the outcome of this election will speak volumes about the resilience and prospects of Iraq's young democracy, and whether the years of bloodshed, sacrifice, and nation-building efforts have paved the way for a brighter future. The electoral campaigns are marked by a fierce competition between the incumbent Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's coalition and its challengers, with each faction vying for power and advocating different political, economic, and social agendas. Issues, such as national reconciliation, post-ISIS reconstruction, economic development, and power-sharing between different ethnic and religious groups, are at the heart of electoral debates. The ability of the incoming government to address these challenges will likely determine its success in solidifying the democratic process and the legitimacy of the state institutions. Moreover, the election's legitimacy will be judged by the level of voter participation and the transparency of the electoral process. A high turnout and a peaceful atmosphere on election day will be significant indicators of the public's confidence in the electoral system and their willingness to engage in the democratic process. Conversely, low voter turnout or incidents of violence and voter intimidation may serve to undermine the election's credibility and calls into question the stability and effectiveness of Iraq's democratic transition. In many ways, this election is a litmus test for how far Iraq has come since the fall of Saddam Hussein and the American-led occupation. The nation has struggled to overcome political, security, and sectarian challenges as it has attempted to rebuild its social fabric, economy, and political institutions. As such, the overall success of the election and the incoming government's ability to address the various challenges facing Iraq will also shape future international support for the country. In conclusion, the upcoming Iraqi election is a crucial moment for the nation's young democracy and is poised to mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. The stakes are high, and the outcome will not only influence the fate of Iraq but also have far-reaching implications for the stability and security of the region as a whole. A successful, transparent, and peaceful election will demonstrate the resilience of Iraq's democratic institutions and signal that the country is on the right track to becoming a stable, prosperous, and influential player in the Middle East. However, a failure to hold a credible election or a continuation of the current challenges facing the nation may be an ominous sign that Iraq's hard-won progress could be at risk and further strain an already fragile region.

Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane.

Option 5: Lies - Lies means false statements, which is the essence of perjury – making false statements under oath. Step 3: Choose the best option - Based on my analysis, I will choose the option that best explains committing perjury. Answer: Lies"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: \\"Of Uranus and Neptune, who is closer to the sun?\\" Context: \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Uranus is closer to the Sun than Neptune. In the context provided, it is mentioned that Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, which means that Uranus is the closer of the two planets to the Sun. The context delves into the differences in the internal heating of Uranus and Neptune and how it impacts their respective weather conditions. Despite being farther from the Sun and receiving only 40% of its amount of sunlight, Neptune's surface temperature is approximately equal to that of Uranus. The temperatures vary within the different layers of Neptune's atmosphere, with the upper regions of its troposphere having a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3°C) and temperatures increasing deeper inside the layers. The source of heating for both Uranus and Neptune remains unknown; however, the disparity in energy is larger for Neptune. While Uranus radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun, Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives. This higher internal energy of Neptune is powerful enough to create the strongest planetary winds in the Solar System. One hypothesis for this difference in heating could be the leftover heat from Neptune's formation. Although this explanation could potentially account for Neptune's higher heat flow, it does not clarify why Uranus lacks the same level of internal heat, given the apparent similarities between the two planets. In conclusion, Uranus is closer to the Sun than Neptune, but the interesting aspect of these two planets lies in the differences in their internal heating and associated weather conditions. Neptune's significantly higher internal heating, despite being farther from the Sun, leads to more varied and intense weather phenomena compared to Uranus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Dan, Bob's dad, is more likely to have more plaques that could potentially block blood flow. High cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, can cause plaque buildup in the arteries. Plaques are deposits of fats, cholesterol, and other substances that can harden, narrow, or eventually block blood vessels. This can lead to reduced blood flow, which can cause serious health problems such as heart attacks and strokes. Since Mary, Bob's mom, has normal cholesterol levels, her risk of plaque buildup and the associated issues is lower than Dan's.

In an interview for HitQuarters, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his Achilles tendon and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for \\"Halo\\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords. They wrote the song in three hours.According to Simon Cowell, owner of the music production company Syco Entertainment, Bogart and Tedder intended \\"Halo\\" for his client, singer Leona Lewis, who could not record the song because of her tight schedule.

Jeffrey was in a wonderful relationship unlike Matthew because","completion":"Jeffrey was in a wonderful relationship unlike Matthew because he had taken the time and effort to truly understand what made a relationship work. He had spent a great deal of time learning about himself, his partner, and the essential ingredients for a strong and healthy bond. From the very beginning, Jeffrey prioritized open communication with his partner, Alison. They discussed their feelings, desires, goals, and fears openly and honestly. Neither one was afraid to be vulnerable, and this willingness to open up allowed their bond to deepen and strengthen as they both supported each other in every aspect of life. Jeffrey and Alison also took the time to express their appreciation and love for each other regularly. They never hesitated to share their feelings and acknowledged each other's achievements and efforts. Acts of love and gratitude became a foundation in their relationship, instilling a sense of trust and security in both of them. Additionally, Jeffrey made sure that they maintained a healthy work-life balance, understanding that spending quality time together is essential for any relationship to thrive. They went on regular date nights, pursued hobbies and interests together, and always took the time to simply enjoy each other's company. They intuitively understood that these moments were instrumental in keeping the spark alive and their connection strong. Unlike Matthew, Jeffrey also sought to continuously grow and evolve alongside his partner. They both invested in personal development individually, as well as together, attending seminars, workshops, and reading books on relationships and personal growth. This commitment to self-improvement created a nurturing atmosphere where both partners encouraged each other to be the best version of themselves. One aspect that set Jeffrey's wonderful relationship apart from Matthew's was the way conflicts were handled. Instead of resorting to blame and anger, Jeffrey and Alison approached any disagreements with a view to understanding, empathizing, and seeking mutually beneficial solutions. They practiced active listening in which they gave their partner the opportunity to express their feelings and concerns without interruption. Through this, they built a solid foundation of trust, respect, and healthy conflict resolution. Moreover, Jeffrey and Alison believed in the importance of maintaining their individual identities while being in a committed relationship. They both had their own hobbies, interests, and friendships outside the relationship, recognizing that a fulfilling life comes from a balance of togetherness and independence. In contrast, Matthew's relationship lacked many of these essential elements. He struggled with communication, often keeping his thoughts and feelings to himself, leading to misunderstandings or resentment within his relationship. His inability to be vulnerable created a barrier that prevented true intimacy and connection with his partner. The absence of regular expressions of love and appreciation left Matthew and his partner feeling unappreciated, and this lack of quality time spent together resulted in a loss of the spark that initially brought them together. Matthew's relationship also suffered due to his unwillingness to grow and evolve as an individual. He lacked the motivation to better himself or pursue personal development, resulting in a stagnant and increasingly unsatisfying relationship. His unhealthy approach to conflict resolution, where anger and blame took precedence over understanding and empathy, further eroded the bond with his partner. In summary, the difference between Jeffrey's wonderful relationship and Matthew's unsuccessful one can be attributed to several key factors. By embracing open communication, regular expressions of love and appreciation, quality time spent together, personal growth, healthy conflict resolution, and balancing individuality with togetherness, Jeffrey created a strong, fulfilling, and nurturing bond with Alison. In contrast, Matthew's lack of these essential ingredients led to the downfall of his relationship. For anyone seeking to establish and maintain a deeply connected and thriving partnership, following Jeffrey's example would be a wise and valuable approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters.

Pick your answer from: (a). no (b). yes","completion":"(b). yes Both questions essentially have the same meaning. They are asking about the policy or reasoning behind Singapore's government not banning employers or job agencies from requesting an applicant's photograph during the job application process. The questions are just phrased slightly differently, but the core subject and inquiry remain the same. To answer the implied question about the policy, it's important to understand some context about job applications and photographs in Singapore: 1. Cultural norms: In some countries, including Singapore, photographs are often included in job applications. The culture surrounding job applications might consider photographs as standard information that is provided when applying for a job. Thus, not prohibiting employers from requesting photographs could be seen as a reflection of this cultural norm. 2. Presentation and appearance: Employers may want to see an applicant's physical appearance as part of their evaluation process to assess how the candidate presents themselves. This can provide additional insight into the applicant's professionalism, confidence, and suitability for a particular job. 3. Anti-discrimination laws: Singapore has anti-discrimination laws which prevent employers from discriminating against job applicants based on factors such as race, religion, nationality, gender, and age. These laws are in place to ensure that the job hiring process is fair and merit-based. However, the request for a photograph in the application process might still be seen as a potential avenue for bias or discrimination. 4. Privacy concerns: Including a photograph in a job application may lead to privacy issues, especially in today's digital age, where personal information is easily disseminated. However, Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) has provisions that regulate the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data, which includes photographs when provided as part of job applications. Based on these factors, it is possible that the government of Singapore does not see it necessary to ban prospective employers from requesting photographs during job applications, provided that employers comply with existing laws. Nonetheless, the debate on the relevance and impact of requesting photographs in job applications continues in many countries, including Singapore."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

See options at the end Back when I was obese, I ate too many snacks and ate too few vegetables, but my weight reacted best when the Select from: + vegetables were bland.; + snacks were bland.;","completion":"\\"Back when I was obese, I ate too many snacks and ate too few vegetables, but my weight reacted best when the snacks were bland.\\" This might seem peculiar but the reasoning behind it is quite logical. Snacks, especially processed ones, are extraordinarily high in added sugars and unhealthy fats, and can easily add a lot of unnecessary calories to your diet. When these snacks are flavored with attractive, alluring tastes, they become even more irresistible, prompting you to consume more of them. Bland snacks, on the other hand, do not possess the same addictive quality. When snacks are bland, they are much less enticing and do not incite the same irresistible cravings, making it easier to eat them in moderation or avoid them altogether. This is the reason why consuming snacks with little flavor seemed to have a significantly positive effect on the weight. Moreover, bland snacks often offer a secondary benefit. Without the added salts, sugars, flavor enhancers, and other artificial additives that deliver those addictive flavors, these bland snacks are generally more healthy. They are less likely to skyrocket your daily intake of sodium and sugar, which are two commonly over-consumed nutrients that have been linked to illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. In contrast, whether vegetables are bland or not doesn't really have the same impact when it comes to weight loss. Vegetables, by default, are known for being low in harm-causing elements such as sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium, which are more typically found in processed foods such as snacks. Instead, vegetables are loaded with beneficial compounds, such as dietary fibers, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that can help you stay healthy, satiated, and less likely to overeat. Preparing vegetables by adding various spices and herbs, or even roasting them, can enhance their flavor without significantly increasing their calorie content. Therefore, eating flavorful vegetables could actually be beneficial for weight loss as these preparations might increase your enjoyment of these high-fiber, nutrient-dense foods, making it easier to stick with a wholesome, vegetable-rich diet. So in summary, it's reasonable to conclude that during my period of overcoming obesity, my weight became more receptive and started to drop when I started consuming bland snacks because it helped to control calorie intake and curb overindulgence. Therefore, my weight reacted best when the snacks were bland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Context: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it Question: When did researchers discover eating a lot of fruit can reduce the risk of an aortic aneurysm?

Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.

Q: Article: The U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that there is an oversupply of college trained workers and that this oversupply is increasing. Already there have been more than enough teachers, engineers, physicists, aerospace experts, and other specialists. Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that aren't there. The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree. On the other hand, there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can deal with, and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old gap that white --collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true. The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen. The reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future. A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree. Parents begin indoctrinating their children with this myth before they are out of grade school. High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life. Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn't matter. Everybody should go to college, so of course they must go. And every year college enrollments go up and up, and more and more graduates are overeducated for the kinds of jobs available to them. One result of this emphasis on a college education is that _ . Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college, half of them do not graduate with their class. Many of them drop out within the first year. Some struggle on for two or three years and then give up. Question: It's implied but not stated in the passage that _ .

Matthias Mueller has been named Volkswagen's new chief executive as the company deals with the aftermath of the diesel emissions scandal. The scandal saw the German automaker admitting to falsifying emissions data in 11 million of its diesel vehicles worldwide to deceive regulators and customers. Step 1: Introduce the background of the former CEO The scandal resulted in the resignation of former CEO Martin Winterkorn, who stepped down on September 23, 2015. Winterkorn had led VW since 2007 and had overseen the company's rise to become the largest automobile manufacturer globally. Step 2: Discuss how Mueller was chosen for the role The Volkswagen supervisory board appointed Matthias Mueller as the new CEO on September 25, 2015. Mueller, a veteran who joined the VW group in 1977, has been credited for overseeing the successful launch of new models and increasing sales during his tenure as the CEO of Porsche AG, a Volkswagen subsidiary. Step 3: Outline the priorities and challenges Mueller will face In his new role, Mueller will have to address the tasks of restructuring the company and restoring trust in the Volkswagen brand. His first priority will be dealing with the legal, financial, and reputational consequences of the emissions scandal. This includes cooperating with investigations into the matter, addressing customer concerns and litigation, and implementing transparent corporate governance reforms. Step 4: Highlight the potential impact of the scandal on the auto industry The Volkswagen emissions scandal can potentially have ripple effects across the entire automotive industry. Regulators around the world are scrutinizing diesel vehicles more closely, leading other automakers to reassess their compliance with emissions standards. Industry experts believe that the increased scrutiny may result in stricter regulations in the future, requiring greater investments in efficient and clean technologies resulting in additional costs on vehicle manufacturers. Step 5: Conclude by commenting on Volkswagen's future prospects Despite the magnitude of the challenges facing Volkswagen, Mueller's long history within the company, his proven leadership skills, and his strategic vision can help navigate through turbulent times. The company has already announced an investment in electric vehicles and other sustainable technologies, which indicates a commitment to change. In conclusion, with Mueller at the helm, many hope that Volkswagen will successfully restore confidence in its brand, adapt to stricter regulations, and continue to innovate, leading the company into a new era of sustainability and growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened. and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Please answer this question : Who had a somatic mutation? Answer:","completion":"Holly had a somatic mutation.

The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Jr., a son from a rival family, which is when Kang assigns Sun-Woo what is perceived (at first) to be a simple errand while he is away on a business trip to shadow his young mistress, Heesoo (Shin Min-a), for fear that she may be cheating on him with another, much younger man, with the mandate that he must kill them both if he discovers their affair. As he performs his duty following Heesoo, and escorting her to a music recital one day he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence, as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent.When he does come to discover Heesoo's secret lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him, but seeing the girl's traumatized state causes him to take pause, pulled by his attraction to her. He thus spares the two on the condition that they no longer see each other again, causing her to harbour enmity towards him, despite the fact he had saved their lives at his own expense.Meanwhile, Sun-woo continues to be embroiled in personal business with Baek Jr., over having beaten up several of his henchmen earlier for overstaying their welcome at the hotel. He is then threatened by one of his enforcers to apologize, but he adamantly refuses, fueled by his frustrations over Heesoo. As he relaxes in his apartment later one night, he is suddenly kidnapped by Baek's men to be tortured, but before they can do so, they receive new orders via phone call, and he is abruptly carried off to Kang, who has returned from overseas and has found out about his attempted cover-up of Heesoo's affair.

Combining both ingredients creates a non-toxic cleaning solution that quickly and effectively breaks down tough grease build-up. Adding the baking soda slowly, to cool water, will prevent it from fizzing up over the top of your pot. The hot water will help loosen the grease, allowing the cleaning solution to fully penetrate into the filter. Remove the water from the heat as soon as it starts to boil; too much agitation will create bubbles from the dish soap, which can spill over onto your stove. You can use this cleaning solution to remove grease from the exhaust hood and fan blades inside your unit. Extra solution can also be used to easily clean your stove-top and oven. Pour the solution slowly to prevent backsplash. Keep adding solution until the grease filter is completely submerged. Keep any extra solution warm, in case an additional soak is needed for a filter with particularly serious grease build-up. You can soak the filter in the same pot you heated the solution, as long as it is not a non-stick pot. The metal filter will scratch non-stick coating. Most pots are not big enough to completely cover a typical grease filter, so you may need to do half of the filter at a time in order to get the entire filter clean. As the filter soaks, the baking soda and dish soap will slowly dissolve the grease. The dirtier the filter, the longer you should let it soak. If you have not cleaned your filter in years, you may need to let it soak for up to an hour. Use a non-abrasive sponge or soft bristled brush to scrub away any remaining grease. The grease should come away easily. Avoid scrubbing aggressively to minimize the risk of damaging your filter. If some of the grease is stuck on the filter, repeat the soaking process with clean solution. Wash away as much grease and residue as possible. Grease will collect faster on areas of the filter that are still dirty. Starting with a perfectly clean filter will slow down future build-up. You do not want any moisture on your filter when you re-install it. Air-drying, instead of using a cloth or blow drying, will prevent the filter from being damaged. The filter should be completely dry after an hour or 2 of air-drying. The more you cook, the more often you should clean your grease filters. Regular cleaning will make your exhaust fan operate much more efficiently, and greatly decrease the health and safety risks that grease build-up presents. Summary:","completion":"Baking soda and dish soap mixed together make a safe cleaning solution that helps get rid of grease. When you mix them with hot water, it can clean things like the filter in your kitchen hood. To clean your filter, you'll need to soak it in the solution and scrub it gently with a soft sponge or brush. It's important to let the filter dry completely before putting it back. Cleaning your filter often helps your kitchen fan work better and keeps your kitchen safer and healthier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To answer the first question, here are some examples of trade-off situations in our life: 1. Time management: Balancing work, family, and personal time often requires trade-offs, as we have limited time in a day. Justification: We have to prioritize and make decisions based on our values and goals. 2. Spending vs saving: Choosing to spend money on immediate desires like a vacation or a luxurious item often means less money for future needs like retirement or emergencies. Justification: We have to strike a balance between enjoying the present and securing the future. 3. Career advancement: Pursuing a promotion or higher salary might require longer working hours or relocation, potentially affecting personal relationships or work-life balance.

Available choices: +They will surprise someone with the roses .. +They will put the roses up for display .. +They will sell the roses for profit .. +They will gift the roses to another person .. Answer the following question: What may happen after they dye the roses ?","completion":"After dyeing the originally dingy white roses using red food coloring, a few potential outcomes may occur, depending on the individual's intentions and interests. Below, each available choice is elaborated. 1. Surprising someone with the roses: In this scenario, the individual may choose to present the newly dyed roses as a thoughtful and creative surprise to a friend, family member, partner, or colleague. The recipient of this gift will likely appreciate the effort and thought put into refreshing the roses and turning them into a vibrant, lovely bouquet. Such a gesture may help to strengthen the bond between the giver and receiver, sparking joy and fostering a sense of gratitude. 2. Putting the roses up for display: If the individual opts to showcase the dyed roses, they can become a beautiful and eye-catching decorative element in any room. They might choose to place them in a vase on a tabletop, windowsill, or mantelpiece, creating an appealing focal point and conversation piece for visitors. Additionally, the roses would serve as a constant reminder of the individual's creativity and resourcefulness in repurposing flowers that were originally destined for the trash. 3. Selling the roses for profit: Should the person choose to capitalize on their resourcefulness, they may decide to sell the freshly dyed roses either online or at a physical location. If successful, it could potentially turn into a profitable and eco-friendly business venture. For example, they might offer to revitalize flowers that others would discard or provide a service for creating custom colored flower arrangements. In this case, the newly dyed roses could help the individual to identify a market niche and launch an entrepreneurial endeavor. 4. Gifting the roses to another person: Finally, the individual may choose to give away the dyed roses as a meaningful gift to someone else. This act of kindness might offer emotional benefits to both parties involved. The receiver will likely feel touched by the individual's creative efforts, while the giver can take pride in their ability to bring happiness to another person's life. This act of generosity might even inspire others to repurpose items they might have otherwise thrown away and foster a sense of community and thoughtfulness. In conclusion, after dyeing the roses with red food coloring, multiple possibilities could unfold, each of which can bring about positive results. Whether the individual chooses to surprise someone, display the roses, sell them for profit, or gift them to another person, their resourcefulness and creativity in repurposing the originally dingy white roses can lead to strengthened relationships, successful business opportunities, and increased feelings of community, happiness, and gratitude."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-Platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). In July 2011, Bennington told Rolling Stone that Linkin Park aims to produce a new album every eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. He later revealed in another interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying \\"We just kind of began. We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time ... we like the direction that we're going in\\". Later, on March 28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band is filming a music video for \\"Burn It Down\\". Joe Hahn directed the video. Shinoda spoke to Co.Create about the album's art, saying that it will \\"blow them [the fans] away ... the average person is not going to be able to look at it and go, I understand that that's completely new, like not just the image but the way they made the image is totally new. So there's going to be that\\". On April 15, 2012, Shinoda announced that Living Things would be the title of Linkin Park's fifth album. Shinoda stated that they chose the title Living Things because the album is more about people, personal interactions, and it is far more personal than their previous albums. The band promoted the album on the 2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus. The band performed \\"Burn It Down\\" at 2012 Billboard Music Awards. On May 24, the band released the music video for \\"Burn It Down\\" and debuted \\"Lies Greed Misery\\", another song from Living Things, on BBC Radio 1. \\"Powerless\\", the twelfth and closing track of the album, was featured in the closing credits of the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Living Things sold over 223,000 copies during its debut week, ranking No. 1 on the US Albums Charts. Linkin Park's single, \\"Castle of Glass\\", was nominated for 'Best Song in a Game' at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards. The band also performed at the award ceremony on December 7, but lost the award to \\"Cities\\" by Beck. Linkin Park also played at the Soundwave music festival in Australia, where they shared the stage with Metallica, Paramore, Slayer and Sum 41. On August 10, 2013, the band collaborated with American musician Steve Aoki to record the song \\"A Light That Never Comes\\" for Linkin Park's online puzzle-action game LP Recharge (short for Linkin Park Recharge), which was launched on Facebook and the official LP Recharge website on September 12, 2013. On the day of the game's release, Linkin Park made a post on their Facebook explaining that the song used to promote the game would be included on a new remix album, entitled Recharged, which was released on October 29, 2013 on CD, vinyl, and digital download. Similar to Reanimation, the album features remixes of ten of the songs from Living Things, with contributions from other artists, such as Ryu of Styles of Beyond, Pusha T, Datsik, KillSonik, Bun B, Money Mark, and Rick Rubin. The band also worked on the soundtrack for the film Mall, which was directed by Joe Hahn.

Founded in 1994, the band consists of guitarist Michael Romeo, keyboardist Michael Pinnella, drummer Jason Rullo, lead vocalist Russell Allen and bassist Michael Lepond. They achieved some commercial success with the 2007 album Paradise Lost and the 2011 album Iconoclast, which reached number 76 on the Billboard 200. Romeo explained the band's name in a 2008 interview; \\"So, you know, the music we were coming up with had the keyboard thing and the guitar, and some classical elements, so the word 'Symphony' came up and, so the dramatic thing, you know? The band is working on releasing a second fan club CD. Michael Romeo said it will be another collection of demo tunes and other rare material, and may also include a bit of content created just for the release, along the lines of MJR's Star Wars tune on the first fan club CD, Rarities and Demos, which has since sold out of its first pressing. SXW, the band's revamped fan club, has relaunched and is now active. The band began recording the drum tracks for the new album on September 9, 2014, and planned to release the complete recording by the spring of 2015. Michael Lepond stated they had ten songs written and that the album would contain either nine or all ten of them. He also stated all lyrics and instrumental tracks were composed and ready to be brought together, and that the album would be less heavy than Iconoclast: \\"If I had to compare, I would say that it's a combination of The Odyssey and Paradise Lost -- something in there. It has a lot of classic Symphony X elements in it, which I think a lot of our fans were missing for a few years. So I think our fans will really like this one. It really just focuses on solid songwriting.\\" As of December 11, 2014, recording of the drums, lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and bass were complete. With the keyboards, guitar solos, background vocals, and some miscellaneous odds and ends being done in the coming weeks. On April 10, 2015 the band announced the mixing and mastering of the new album was complete. On May 18, 2015, the band announced the title of the album would be titled Underworld, and a release date of July 24, 2015. The first single from the album, \\"Nevermore\\", premiered on May 22, 2015. The band released the second single, \\"Without You\\", on June 19, 2015, and was made available for digital download. According to singer Russell Allen, the band entered a short hiatus during 2017 in which they did not perform, due in part to his commitment to Adrenaline Mob, although it was announced during a January 2018 interview with Metal Nation that the band had plans to get together in the following months and begin writing a follow up to Underworld. On July 14, 2017, Adrenaline Mob was involved in a serious vehicular accident, which resulted in severe injuries for Allen and two deaths. When was the album released?","completion":"The album titled \\"Underworld\\" by the band Symphony X was released on July 24, 2015. This album was a much-anticipated release by the fans, as it reflected the classic Symphony X elements that many fans had missed in their recent works. The album was a combination of elements from their previous works, “The Odyssey” and “Paradise Lost,” according to Michael Lepond, the band’s bassist. Before the full release of the album, two singles were made available. The first single titled \\"Nevermore\\" premiered on May 22, 2015. This was followed by the second single, \\"Without You\\", which was released on June 19, 2015, and was made available for digital download. The album's preparation phase was a well-planned and executed one. The band started recording the drum tracks for \\"Underworld\\" on September 9, 2014. The complete recording was planned to be released by the spring of 2015, and it was stated that the album would contain either nine or all ten of the songs written. The recording of the drums, lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and bass were complete as of December 11, 2014, with the remaining work on keyboards, guitar solos, background vocals and miscellaneous elements planned to be finished in the coming weeks. The mixing and mastering of the new album was announced complete on April 10, 2015. In retrospect, “Underworld” serves as a testament to Symphony X’s dedication to their music, showcasing their ability to incorporate classical elements into their distinctive progressive metal sound. After releasing this album, however, the band did take a short hiatus in 2017 due to various commitments and events, but they planned to reconvene and start writing a follow-up to \\"Underworld\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The shock of discovering an affair brings with it a range of emotions, from anger and jealousy to shame and embarrassment. When emotions are rampant, it's difficult to think clearly. Look for outside help—someone to talk to who can help you to begin to heal. Feelings that are overwhelming begin to diminish if you’re able to speak about them to someone who cares and who knows how to listen. A therapist can offer an objective perspective and a calming environment for talking out your problems. A therapist has education and experience to help them guide you through the first days that follow the discovery of an affair. Speak to family or friends, too. Choose listeners who will remain calm and listen and not feed the flames of emotion you’re already struggling to handle. While it’s generally accepted that affairs are symptomatic of problems in a relationship, there may be multiple reasons why your partner had an affair. One of the major reasons for infidelity is opportunity. Sometimes an affair isn’t planned. People sometimes “stumble” into affairs, rather than plan them. Many people engage in affairs because they want to see if they’re desirable outside of the relationship. Affairs could also be a symptom of another problem, like alcohol abuse or sex addiction. It might be tempting, because laying the blame on yourself makes the problem easier to control; theoretically, you could change your behavior and you prevent another affair. However, the problem, at the very least, is the responsibility of both partners. Blaming yourself might offer temporary hope, but it won't resolve the problem. Don’t absolve your partner of accountability for the affair by thinking that you should love your partner unconditionally, or put their happiness before your own. Resist diminishing the affair as a “little mistake.”Don't chide yourself for overreacting. It’s true that the affair was probably a symptom of problems in your relationship. And it might be true that you contributed to the problems that led to the affair. But it’s also true that your partner had other options—other ways to express dissatisfaction or disappointments. Your partner chose to have an affair. You didn’t make that choice for your partner. Most couples want to stay together after an affair. About 70 percent of couples try to rebuild their relationships. Assess your relationship. The likelihood of being able to forgive and move forward increases if you both feel the relationship is worth saving. Identify the qualities in your partner that led to the affair so that you can understand how likely it is that another affair is on the horizon. Personality traits such as self-centeredness, dishonesty and a feeling of entitlement suggest that, for some people, it’s not possible to remain faithful.If you’re hoping to fix a relationship that will constantly need fixing it might be time to move on. Assess your partner’s willingness to be accountable for their actions. Are they sorry about the actions? Or are they sorry about getting caught? Does your partner shows signs, such as guilt, that signal they’re aware their actions were wrong? Think about the positives, too. What were the strengths of your relationship? What initially brought you together? It's difficult to focus on the positives after your partner has cheated, but try to be objective. Summary:","completion":"Dealing with the aftermath of discovering an affair involves seeking outside help, understanding the reasons behind the infidelity, addressing shared responsibility, and assessing the relationship's worth and potential for healing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brett wanted Nick to plant a tree in their yard but","completion":"Brett wanted Nick to plant a tree in their yard, but their initial disagreement transformed into a lesson in communication, compromise, and environmental stewardship. At first, Nick was hesitant to plant a tree, as he believed their yard was not spacious enough and he was concerned about the maintenance it would require. Brett, on the other hand, was adamant about the benefits that planting a tree would bring to their property and the environment. The two of them set about addressing their concerns and researching the different aspects of tree planting. They started by discussing the various advantages of having a tree in their yard. Brett emphasized the aesthetic value that a tree offers and explained that trees can provide natural shade and act as a privacy screen. Moreover, she drew attention to the benefits of trees in reducing air pollution, absorbing carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen, and supporting wildlife habitats. Nick gradually began to appreciate the importance of planting a tree and how it could improve their quality of life. To allay Nick's concerns about space, they both spent time researching trees that would be suitable for their yard size and soil quality. They decided to look for a small or medium-sized tree that could fit comfortably within their property boundary without causing any potential issues later on. They also took into consideration the growth rate and maintenance requirements of the tree species they were considering. After some research, they agreed on planting a flowering dogwood tree. This type of tree remains relatively small in size, has an attractive appearance, and is low-maintenance. The compromise they reached was a responsible decision for both their yard and the environment, as the flowering dogwood tree is native to their region and does not consume too much water. Nick and Brett learned an essential lesson about the importance of communication and compromise in achieving a common goal. They acknowledged each other's concerns, sought a solution by researching and gathering information, and eventually agreed on planting a tree that met both their expectations. Additionally, they also became more environmentally conscious throughout the process and realized the significance of playing their part in addressing climate change and promoting biodiversity. In the end, Brett's initial desire to plant a tree, coupled with Nick's willingness to compromise and learn about different tree species, allowed them to find a satisfactory solution and strengthen their relationship. The planted flowering dogwood tree would serve as a symbol of their cooperation, environmental responsibility, and growth as individuals and as a couple."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: To obtain juice from an orange,","completion":"To obtain juice from an orange, you can follow these steps: 1. Choose ripe and juicy oranges: The first step in obtaining juice from an orange is selecting the right fruit. Look for oranges that are heavy for their size and have slightly soft, smooth, and glossy skin. Avoid those with wrinkles, blemishes, or overly rough skin, as these may be indicators of poor quality or lack of juice content. 2. Wash the oranges: Rinse the oranges thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt, pesticides, or bacteria that may be present on their surface. 3. Soften the fruit: Before juicing, roll the oranges on a flat surface while applying light pressure with the palm of your hand. This will help in breaking the membranes around the juice vesicles, making it easier to extract the juice. 4. Cut the oranges: Place the orange on its side on a cutting board, and, using a sharp knife, carefully slice the fruit in half through its equator. Ensure that you are cutting across the sections and not through the stem end. There are various methods to extract the juice from the halved oranges: A. Hand squeeze method: 1. Hold one half of the sliced orange in your hand, cut-side facing up. 2. Squeeze the orange firmly, allowing the juice to drip into a container or glass. 3. To extract as much juice as possible, twist and press the orange at the same time. 4. Some people use a fork or a spoon to press down on the orange, helping to release more juice. 5. Repeat with the other half. B. Citrus juicer method: 1. Purchase a citrus juicer if you don't have one already. These come in a variety of styles: manual, electric, or even attachment pieces for a blender or food processor. 2. Place the halved orange on the juicer cone, cut-side down. 3. For manual juicers, press down on the orange while twisting it back and forth. For an electric citrus juicer, push down on the orange, and the motorized cone will automatically rotate to extract the juice. 4. The juice will flow through a strainer to remove any seeds and pulp, and straight into a container or glass. 5. Repeat with the other half. C. Using a lemon squeezer or citrus press: 1. Place the halved orange, cut-side facing down, into the lemon squeezer or citrus press. 2. Firmly press the handles together to crush the orange, releasing its juice. 3. The juice will flow through the holes or strainer into a container or glass. 4. Repeat with the other half. 5. Remove seeds and pulp: Some people prefer a clear juice without any pulp. If that is the case, strain the juice using a fine-mesh strainer or sieve to remove any seeds or pulp remnants from the juice. 6. Serve immediately or refrigerate: Freshly squeezed orange juice can be enjoyed immediately or stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to two days. The flavor and nutritional content will be best when consumed the same day. That's how you can obtain juice from an orange using different methods. No matter which method you choose, freshly squeezed orange juice is a delicious and nutritious addition to any breakfast or snack time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He picks up an acid solution that he labels as solution A. To compare it with another solution he chooses a solution that is not an acid. He labels it as solution B. Which solution has higher pH value, soution A or solution B? A:","completion":"Solution B will have a higher pH value than solution A. Let's understand why by discussing the properties of acids, bases, and the pH scale. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale that ranges from 0 to 14, where 7 represents a neutral solution. The scale is used to quantify the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a solution. A solution with a pH level below 7 is considered an acid, while a solution with a pH level above 7 is considered a base (alkaline). Acids are substances that dissolve in water and release hydrogen ions (H+) into the solution. These hydrogen ions contribute to the acidic nature of the solution. Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and nitric acid (HNO3). Acids usually have sour taste, can change the color of certain pH indicators (such as litmus paper), and can also conduct electricity due to the presence of ions. On the other hand, bases (also known as alkalis) are substances that dissolve in water and release hydroxide ions (OH-) into the solution. These hydroxide ions contribute to the alkaline nature of the solution. Some common examples of bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). Bases, contrary to acids, have a bitter taste, feel slippery when touched, can also change the color of pH indicators, and can conduct electricity. Now, let's go back to Mike's solutions. Solution A is an acid solution, which means its pH value will be below 7. In contrast, Solution B is not an acid (and thus might be a base or neutral solution), implying that its pH value will be at least 7 or higher. Therefore, comparing the two solutions, we can conclude that Solution B has a higher pH value compared to Solution A."},{"prompt":"Addison walked home from work after realizing she had a flat tire.

Summarize this article: When using PowerPoint slides you want them to actually help and raise the quality of your presentation, not simply exist alongside it. The best way to do this is to ensure that your slides do not simply restate what you are saying. You should not be reading from your slides. Really, you want PowerPoint presentations to contain as little text as possible. Having to read text will distract your audience, even if only unconsciously, from what you are telling them. With this in mind, keep your text to a minimum and present it in a way that is easy to read, such as a bulleted list. So, if you can't put all your information onto your slides, how are you supposed to tell your audience everything that can't fit into your speech? Handouts! Make a one or two page handout, for each audience member or for people to take at will, which contains a section for each slide or portion of your presentation. Here you can put extra information or key points of information that were included in your presentation. Graphics are what make a really engaging PowerPoint presentation. These can provide your audience with a new way of looking at what you are trying to tell them. They can provide information which may be difficult for you to convey in words, such as charts and graphs. You will want to be sure, however, that they actually add to your presentation and do not simply provide a distraction. With the above information in mind, you will want to be absolutely sure that you do not include unnecessary visuals or audio. Examples would include transition animations, clip art, sound effects, and cluttered templates or background images. These are the features which tend to make Powerpoint presentations boring, dated, and unhelpful. They distract audience members and add nothing to the presentation. They even hinder the audience's ability to absorb information. Summary:","completion":"Create effective PowerPoint presentations by limiting text, avoiding reading from slides, and focusing on clear visuals, such as charts and graphs. Use handouts to share additional information or key points. Ensure any visuals or audio elements contribute to the presentation without distracting or hindering the audience's understanding."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: What is funny? The short answer is: Who knows? The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \\"in\\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you. Because that's what it feels like. What do you say if you realize your joke upset someone? Apologize as briefly and as sincerely as you can, and hope that someone changes the subject. Try saying: \\"I'm sorry. I should have known better\\" or \\"I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.\\" What do you do if people don't get your joke or don't appear to find it as funny... Question: Which of the following best describes the writer's opinion on joke-telling? Options: A: Nobody knows what makes a joke funny. B: We should not tell jokes unless we are asked to do so.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

On November 4, 2014, it was announced that Lifetime had cancelled Witches of East End after a decline in ratings during the second season. The first season averaged 1.67 million viewers, but dropped in its second season to 1.13 million. After its cancellation, fans launched an online petition campaign to save the show called \`\`Renew Witches of East End''. The petition became popular on Twitter, where fans were told to use the hashtag #RenewWitchesofEastEnd and tweet it to Lifetime's Twitter account. Fans have also campaigned the online streaming service Netflix to pick up the show. The campaign received support from celebrities on Twitter who backed the show to be renewed, including Channing Tatum, William Shatner and Snooki as well as stars from cult television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Sarah Michelle Gellar and Charmed's Shannen Doherty and Holly Marie Combs. As of June 2017 and after 3 years since the finale, the petition has received more than 272,000 signatures.

Premise: \\"yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I hope I never do anything that serious.\\"?","completion":"The given premise is \\"yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic.\\" To analyze whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I hope I never do anything that serious,\\" we must first break down the meaning and components of each statement and identify any logical connections between them. Premise: \\"I hope to never venture into something that drastic\\" This statement suggests that the speaker has a desire to avoid participating in any actions, decisions, or events that could be considered drastic. The term \\"drastic\\" typically implies a significant, possibly extreme, change from the norm or a highly consequential decision. It may involve risks or have far-reaching implications that could negatively impact the speaker or others involved. The speaker's desire to avoid such circumstances indicates their preference for less dramatic, more predictable situations. Hypothesis: \\"I hope I never do anything that serious\\" In this statement, the speaker expresses a similar desire, but this time they are referring to the level of seriousness rather than the degree of drastic change. The term \\"serious\\" can denote various contexts, such as the importance, gravity, or weight of a situation. A serious action, event, or decision bears significant consequences and may entail considerable responsibility. The use of the term \\"serious\\" in this context also conveys a sense of caution and mindfulness regarding the potential impacts of such actions. Now let's examine any logical connections between the premise and the hypothesis. Both statements share a common theme: the speaker's desire to avoid engaging in situations that carry high stakes, significant consequences, or substantial responsibility. In both instances, the focus is on not taking part in events or actions that may lead to undesirable outcomes. The premise and hypothesis are closely related in that they convey the speaker's preference for less consequential situations. In fact, one might argue that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise's focus on avoiding \\"drastic\\" situations implicitly suggests that the speaker also wishes to avoid \\"serious\\" situations since drastic actions or events are often serious in nature, bearing significant consequences or requiring a high level of responsibility. However, it is important to note that the terms \\"drastic\\" and \\"serious\\" are not synonymous. Drastic events are more about the magnitude of change and the extent of deviation from the norm, while seriousness pertains to the importance or gravity of a situation. It is possible to have a drastic change that may not be serious, as well as a serious situation that is not drastic. That being said, given the overlap in the implications and consequences of both drastic and serious situations, we can reasonably infer that if the speaker hopes to never venture into something that drastic, it is likely that they also hope to never do anything that serious. In conclusion, the premise \\"I hope to never venture into something that drastic\\" does provide support for the hypothesis \\"I hope I never do anything that serious\\" due to the shared themes of aversion to high-stakes situations and the desire to avoid undesirable consequences. While the terms \\"drastic\\" and \\"serious\\" are not interchangeable, their close relationship in terms of potential impact and significance makes it plausible that the speaker's desire to avoid one would extend to the other."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Possible answers: throw the ball away, find the ball, walk away from the ball Answer:","completion":"Before Sydney takes any of the actions mentioned, there is a crucial step that Sydney needs to address. First and foremost, Sydney needs to evaluate the situation and identify the potential threat to the ball. Are there any suspicious individuals or potential thieves around? Is the ball in a vulnerable location where it can easily be taken? How much does the ball mean to Sydney, and would the loss of the ball cause any significant distress? Once Sydney has a clearer understanding of the potential risks, they can decide which course of action is most appropriate. Each possible solution mentioned has its merits and may be suited to different scenarios: 1. Throw the ball away: If Sydney feels that the ball is no longer valuable or worth protecting, discarding the ball may be the most suitable option. By doing so, Sydney eliminates the worry that someone might take the ball and can move on from the situation with peace of mind. However, this option may not be ideal if the ball holds any sentimental value or is essential for future use. 2. Find the ball: If Sydney has misplaced the ball or is uncertain of its whereabouts, their priority should be locating it. Sydney will need to retrace their steps and search for the ball in any areas where it may have been left behind. Once the ball is found, Sydney can then decide how best to protect it and prevent it from being stolen. 3. Walk away from the ball: This option suggests that Sydney prefers to distance themselves from the situation altogether. Walking away from the ball may be the best option if Sydney feels overwhelmed by the potential threat or wishes to prioritize their safety over the protection of the ball. However, walking away also means accepting the possibility that the ball may be taken. Sydney will need to weigh the value of the ball against their personal well-being and decide if this course of action aligns with their priorities. In conclusion, before Sydney can commit to any particular solution, they must first assess the details of their situation, identify the potential risks to their ball, and weigh the pros and cons of each available option.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the publication that called the Elgin shoemaker the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\"? Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling.

The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypts population. Half of Pariss population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353. While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time.

This equation is to be solved for the variable 'r'. To solve this equation for r, you have to find the value of 'r' that makes both sides of the equation equal. The first step in solving the equation involves simplifying the equation by combining like terms. The right side of the equation has -88*r and +63*r as similar terms because they both contain the variable 'r'. Therefore, we can combine these like terms (-88*r + 63*r) by adding them together. The operation of addition is valid according to the properties of real numbers. Remember, when you add a negative term and a positive term, it's like subtracting the smaller from the larger, and the result takes the sign of the larger. -88*r + 63*r = (-88 + 63)*r = -25*r Substituting -25*r back into the equation, it becomes: 50 = -25*r The next step is to isolate the variable 'r'. We do this by performing the inverse operation on both sides of the equation. In this case, since -25*r implies multiplication, we perform division on both sides. r=50/(-25) Finally, solve the right side of the equation by performing the division operation. The division of positive 50 by negative 25 yields 'r' as -2: r= -2 Therefore, the solution to the equation 50 = -88*r + 63*r for 'r' is r = -2. That is, if r equals -2, both sides of the equation will be equal, and hence, the equation will hold true."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Rules of Survival (2006), is a novel by Nancy Werlin.

Pick your answer from: 1). triglyceride 2). cortisol 3). melatonin 4). amylase Q: Digestive enzymes, including which enzyme, start breaking down starches into sugars? A: Answer:","completion":"Amylase is the digestive enzyme that starts breaking down starches into sugars. Amylase is primarily produced in the salivary glands and the pancreas. It plays a crucial role in the process of digestion, as it helps in the initial breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simpler and more easily absorbable sugars. Starches, which are a form of complex carbohydrate, are long chains of glucose molecules that are present in various foods, primarily in grains and vegetables. As soon as we begin chewing food, the salivary glands secrete saliva, which contains amylase. This enzyme starts to break down the starches into simpler sugars like maltose and dextrin. This process continues in the small intestine, where pancreatic amylase is secreted and further breaks down the starches into simpler sugars and eventually into glucose molecules. Amylase is essential for proper digestion and absorption of nutrients, as the body can only absorb and utilize simple sugars – such as glucose – for energy production and other metabolic processes. Consequently, this enzyme plays a vital role in converting the carbohydrates from our diet into usable energy, thus supporting general health and well-being. While the other options - triglyceride, cortisol, and melatonin - are essential biological molecules, they don't perform the function of breaking down starches into sugars. Triglyceride is a type of lipid that serves as a significant energy storage molecule, cortisol is a hormone involved in stress response and glucose metabolism, and melatonin is a hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One morning Felipe woke up with a sharp pain in his head. He was dizzy , and he couldn't breathe. His parents rushed Felipe to the hospital.

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs.

Answer:","completion":"Jean-Claude Mukanya, born on May 1, 1968, in Switzerland, was a professional footballer who was best known for being a solid and reliable defender during his playing years. Mukanya's career spanned over a decade, showcasing skill, dedication, and determination. He was able to represent his national team, the Democratic Republic of Congo, which became an essential part of his identity as a player. Mukanya began his professional football journey in 1989 with the Belgian club KFC Lommel. During his time at Lommel, he managed to make an impressive 100 appearances, netting 10 goals for the club - a respectable number for a defender. His skill and presence on the field were quickly recognized, which led to his next tenure at the Dutch club NAC Breda from 1996 to 1996. Although Mukanya only managed to make nine appearances for the club, he still contributed significantly to the team's success during his short stint in the Netherlands. In 1996, Mukanya's career took him to another Belgian club, Eendracht Aalst, where he played until 1999. He displayed a remarkable level of consistency, making 47 appearances and scoring three goals. His tenure at Aalst further solidified his reputation as a strong and reliable defender. Mukanya's final stop as a professional footballer was with the Israeli club Hapoel Be'er Sheva from 1999-2001. He played two seasons with the club, showcasing his exceptional ability as a defender and rounding out a decade-long career. Standing at 1.87 meters tall, Mukanya's height was undoubtedly an advantage on the field, allowing him to dominate aerial duels and maintain a commanding presence at the back. His skill and physical attributes caught the attention of the DR Congo national team, and his international career began in 1991. He represented his country with pride and dedication until 1999, earning multiple international caps during his 8-year stint. Jean-Claude Mukanya's life story is a testament to the commitment and passion that one must have to succeed in the world of professional football.

If the child or of your choice won't be using the account, you'll need copies of the transaction statement, as well as the checks or money coming in through the account. You also may need more personal information and more pending documentation. In a divorce, ensuring the financial security of a child is of utmost importance, and protecting shared accounts is a crucial step in achieving this. When a child will no longer be using a shared account, it is necessary to gather all the relevant documentation to monitor and manage the account effectively. This includes obtaining copies of transaction statements and records of any checks or money deposited into or withdrawn from the account. Additionally, gathering more personal information about the account holders and any pending documentation is vital. This personal information may pertain to the identities of the individuals on the account, their relationship to the child, and any legal agreements associated with the shared account. Collecting pending documentation can help you understand any ongoing transactions or financial obligations tied to the account. This information will aid in creating a clear picture of the account's financial status, enabling you to make informed decisions about its future during the divorce proceedings. Furthermore, completing a financial disclosure statement is a necessary part of any divorce, requiring you to list all accounts associated with either spouse. This statement will provide an overview of your current financial situation, allowing both you and the court to allocate resources fairly and ensure the best possible outcome for your child.

Having brought Jesse's hands up to touch the scar on her face, she is showing a level of trust and openness that is significant in their relationship. Kendall may recount the story behind her scar, describing the events that led to it and the impact it had on her life. By doing this, she is inviting Jesse to not only physically touch her scar but also to empathize with the emotional pain and experiences associated with it. As they continue to sit in this moment together, Kendall may want to explore Jesse's own experiences, scars, or emotional baggage. This would involve encouraging him to share his own vulnerabilities and to reveal parts of himself that he may have otherwise kept hidden. Kendall may gently ask probing questions to guide him through this process or simply offer a listening ear and supportive presence, making it clear that she is truly interested in understanding his story as well. Depending on the context and level of intimacy between Kendall and Jesse, this moment could potentially be a catalyst for a heart-to-heart conversation in which both parties reveal more about their past experiences, emotional traumas, and personal growth.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Iraq is boiling in unprecedented heat. Here’s how locals are trying to cope. BAGHDAD — I spent several days reporting on a record heatwave in Iraq. Baghdad, the capital, has boiled in temperatures at 109 degrees or higher almost every day since June 19. The mercury in the southern city of Basra reached an incredible 129 degrees on July 22. It’s not just Iraq, either. Countries across the Middle East and North Africa have sizzled this summer in extreme weather that has sounded alarms among climate experts. Global warming, they say, has already taken a harsh toll on these areas, and it will only get worse. So I decided to use Instagram to document what life in such blistering heat is like for people in Baghdad. Below are some pictures of what I witnessed: Abdel-Amir Hamoud owns a massive nursery in Baghdad where he sells everything from palm trees to roses. This summer has been so hot, he said, that more than 150,000 of his plants have dried out and died. Climate experts predict that warmer temperatures will have a devastating impact on farming in the region. Jassam Farhan, 69, lives with his family in a camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Baghdad. Earlier this month, he passed out from the extreme heat and had to be taken to the hospital. His son contracted typhoid from the camp’s communal — and dirty — water source late last month. And every 20 minutes or so, just to keep cool, his grandchildren bathe in a metal pan filled with that same dirty water. There’s no air conditioning because of constant power cuts. Tens of thousands of other Iraqis are displaced and must also brave the elements. This is a picture of the communal water source at the camp where the Farhan family resides. When I took this picture, the temperature had soared beyond 110 degrees. Friday is the start of the weekend in Iraq, but this picture taken on a recent Friday shows just how unusually empty Baghdad’s streets have become because of the heat. If you step outside in temperatures that reach 120 degrees and higher — as many Iraqis have been forced to do this summer — it can literally feel like your face is burning. Power cuts that last 12 hours or longer in Iraq mean that homes can become uncomfortably warm during this particularly hot summer. And for kids, that’s just awful, especially since there is already a lack of air-conditioned recreational facilities here. So many boys improvise by cooling off in the Tigris River, where they fish and play games. Here’s a video of them swimming across this large body of water, which wends its way through Baghdad. One of the many kids taking a dip in the Tigris River on a recent Friday. Summary:","completion":"Iraq is experiencing an unprecedented heatwave, with temperatures in Baghdad reaching 109 degrees almost every day since June 19 and 129 degrees in Basra on July 22. Countries across the Middle East and North Africa are also facing extreme heat, causing climate experts to raise concerns about the toll of global warming on these regions. Locals attempt to cope with the heat by seeking alternative cooling methods, as power cuts disrupt air conditioning. The intense heat has caused many plants to die, and is predicted to have devastating effects on farming in the region. Displaced Iraqis in camps face additional challenges from the heat, such as dirty communal water sources and health issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance!

This movie's origins are a mystery to me, as I only know as much as IMDB did before I rented it. I assume that before \\"Starship Troopers\\", \\"Killshot\\" was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network, cable, or otherwise. The new title of \\"Kill Shot\\" is comically thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema. The quick cuts, cheesy \\"Melrose Place\\" music, and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for. And I don't mind at all. I rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the SciFi travesty of Starship Troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot a movie - but that's another review). After looking it up on IMDB, my roommate and I surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards own career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted R-rated status - coveted in suspense Video Rental sections, that is. In any event, they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section. All in all, it's entertaining. I hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a TV pilot, though. That was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a TV show, the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual. Would I rent it again? No. Would I watch this TV show? Well, why not - it's better than Baywatch. And their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. Token black guy (who's gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter-racial dating), token Asian (Japanese, I assume from the name Koji) more adept at science and computers than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent Latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account - this show probably would have done ok. But as a movie it just cracks me. I gave it a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to become. It made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I ask of rentals.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Will Rodman, a scientist at the San Francisco biotech company Gen-Sys, is testing the viral-based drug ALZ-112 on chimpanzees to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. ALZ-112 is given to a chimp named Bright Eyes, greatly increasing her intelligence. However, during Will's presentation for the drug, Bright Eyes is forced from her cage, goes on a rampage, and is killed. Will's boss Steven Jacobs terminates the project and orders the chimps euthanized. However, Will's assistant Robert Franklin discovers that Bright Eyes had recently given birth to an infant chimp. Will agrees to take in the chimp, who is named Caesar. Will learns that Caesar has inherited his mother's intelligence and decides to raise him. Three years later, Will introduces Caesar to the redwood forest at Muir Woods National Monument. Meanwhile, Will treats his dementia-suffering father Charles with ALZ-112, which seems to restore his cognitive ability.When Caesar reaches adolescence and sees a dog on a leash like his own, he questions his identity and learns of his origins from Will. Meanwhile, Charles's condition returns as his Alzheimer's becomes resistant to ALZ-112. Caesar injures a neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker, while defending a confused Charles. As a result, he is placed in a primate shelter where he is treated cruelly by the other chimps and the chief guard, Dodge Landon. Caesar learns how to unlock his cage, gaining free access to the common area. With the assistance of a gorilla named Buck, he confronts the sanctuary's alpha chimp named Rocket and claims that position. Meanwhile, Jacobs clears development of a more powerful, gaseous version of the drug â ALZ-113 â when Will tells him it can not only heal brain diseases but also improve intelligence. Will takes the drug home to try to save his father, but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight.After attempting to test the drug on a scarred bonobo test subject named Koba, Franklin becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill. Attempting to warn Will at his home, he sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is later discovered dead. Will attempts to reclaim Caesar, but the chimp refuses to go home with him. Instead, he escapes from the facility and returns to Will's house, where he takes canisters of the ALZ-113. Upon returning, Caesar releases the gas and allows it to enhance the intelligence of the other apes. When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage, Caesar shocks him by speaking for the first time, yelling \\"No!\\" Caesar then electrocutes the cattle prod-wielding Dodge by spraying him with water, unintentionally killing him. The apes flee the facility, release the remaining chimps from Gen-Sys, and free more apes from the San Francisco Zoo.A battle ensues as the ape army fights their way past a police blockade on the Golden Gate Bridge to escape into the redwood forest. Buck sacrifices himself to save Caesar by jumping onto the helicopter in which Jacobs is riding. The helicopter crashes onto the bridge, trapping Jacobs in the wreckage. Jacobs is then killed by Koba. As the apes find their way into the forest, Will arrives and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them down, and begs him to return home. In response, Caesar hugs him and says that, \\"Caesar is home.\\" Will, realizing that this is indeed their last goodbye, respects Caesar's wishes. In a mid-credits scene, an infected Hunsiker leaves his house for work as an airline pilot, arriving at San Francisco International Airport for his flight to Paris.

Please answer the following question: M: The same to you. What was said before this conversation? A:","completion":"Without the full context of the conversation, it's difficult to know exactly what was said before \\"The same to you.\\" However, based on this response, we can make an educated guess about the tone and subject matter leading up to it. It's important to note that \\"The same to you\\" is generally used as a response to someone's well-wishing, congratulation, or expression of goodwill. Based on this, we can infer that the conversation prior to this statement likely involved one person offering a similar sentiment towards the other. Let me provide a few potential scenarios that might have led to the response \\"The same to you.\\" Scenario 1: Person A: \\"Hey, just wanted to wish you a happy birthday!\\" Person B: \\"Thank you! The same to you.\\" (Assuming person B refers to an upcoming or recent birthday of person A) Scenario 2: Person A: \\"Congratulations on your new job! I hope it goes well.\\" Person B: \\"Thanks! The same to you.\\" (Assuming person A has also recently started a new job or is seeking one) Scenario 3: Person A: \\"Happy holidays!

We have the math problem: -7*u - 23 = -4*u - 4*u First, let's combine the two terms with 'u' on the right side of the equation: -4*u - 4*u can be combined into -8*u (because -4 and -4 added together make -8). So, now our equation looks like this: -7*u - 23 = -8*u Now, we want to get all the 'u' terms on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. We can do this by adding 8*u to both sides of the equation. This will get rid of u from the right side: -7*u + 8*u - 23 = 0 Now, let's simplify it. -7*u + 8*u equals 1*u (or just 'u', because when we add -7 to 8, we get 1): u - 23 = 0 The next step is to get 'u' all by itself. To do that, we can add 23 to both sides of the equation: u - 23 + 23 = 0 + 23 Now, the -23 and +23 cancel each other out on the left side, leaving us with: u = 23 So, the solution for 'u' is 23!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Flimsy, lightweight fabrics may seem breezy and casual, but they can cling to your body and actually become a bit uncomfortable. Fabrics that are a bit more substantial will make you look svelte and smooth. They offer support while also concealing any lines from undergarments. You don’t need to write off fabrics like silk and cotton forever, but be sure to try different fabrics to find what feels best to you. As a heavily obese girl, it may be tempting to stay in a certain fashion comfort zone. There is nothing wrong with embracing a flowy, boho style, but try on other options too. The next time you go out clothes shopping, take something you wouldn't normally wear into the fitting room with you. You may like something you never expected to! You don’t need to buy any of the clothing you try, and you don’t need to show anyone. Just try to be open-minded about other styles of clothing. Remember, you won’t know how something looks on you unless you give it a try. You can dress according to your body type and abide by fashion tips, but at the end of the day, you should show off whatever you want to show off! If you love your shoulders, expose them in a plunging off the shoulder top. If you love your backside, wear a formfitting skirt to boast your behind. You know better than anyone what you’re working with, so highlight your best features. Don’t be afraid of bright colors – just make sure that the clothing fits appropriately! For a sleek look, try creating monochromatic outfits with various textures. If you want to wear stripes, opt for thin, light-colored stripes on a darker background. Vertical stripes will help you look slimmer than horizontal ones as well. If you particularly love a part of your body, wear fun, bright patterns on other parts to draw attention to it. While it's fun to highlight, accentuate, and maximize certain features, try not to worry about minimizing others. If there's an area of your body that you may not love as much as others, try something radical and show that area off! Dress to make yourself feel happy and confident, not to follow fashion \\"rules\\" or to hide your body.","completion":"The article highlights the importance of choosing the right fabrics and being open to experimenting with different styles when dressing, especially for those who are heavily obese. Lightweight fabrics, such as silk and cotton, can cling to the body and be uncomfortable, while more substantial fabrics provide support and conceal undergarment lines. It advises not writing off lighter fabrics entirely, but rather trying various fabrics to discover what feels best. The author encourages stepping out of one's fashion comfort zone and trying new styles by selecting pieces not usually worn during clothes shopping. This experimentation can result in discovering a style that was never expected to be liked. No commitment to purchase or show others these new styles is required; it is merely a suggestion to maintain an open mind. Dressing according to one's body type and following fashion tips is advisable, but ultimately, it is crucial to wear what showcases the features one loves. The article suggests highlighting favorite features, whether it's shoulders, backside, or any other body part, and not being afraid of bright colors as long as the clothing fits well. Creating monochromatic outfits with varying textures can lead to a sleek look. Opting for thin, light-colored stripes on a darker background helps in looking slimmer. Wearing bright patterns on body parts other than the area to be emphasized draws attention to the loved part. The main focus should be on feeling happy and confident in the outfit, rather than strictly adhering to fashion rules or hiding one's body.

Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What did Simon buy Nan off to do? Title: Circle of Friends Movie plot: Set in 1950s Ireland, the film focuses on the experiences of Bernadette \\"Benny\\" Hogan and her two friends, Eve Malone and Nan Mahon. They are characterised early on in childhood, during their First Communion: Benny is the beloved and well-fed only child, Eve the orphan raised by nuns and Nan is destined to be defined by her beauty. The three girls grow up in the small town of Knockglen. Skip to eight years later: Nan has moved on to Dublin years earlier, and Benny and Eve have graduated from the local convent school and are heading to Dublin to attend university. Eve's education is financed by the local wealthy Westward Protestant family, her father's employers until his death. The family has also willed to her a cottage on their property. Eve boards at a convent in Dublin, while Benny must commute daily between home and Dublin, her parents being loath to let her go. They would prefer she marry the loathsome and creepy Sean Walsh, her father's faithful employee at his tailor shop. Once in Dublin the two girls reconnect with a mature and sophisticated Nan who is quite aware of her bewitching effect on the opposite sex. Benny eventually falls in love with Jack Foley, a handsome rugby player and doctor's son, studying medicine and expected to follow in his father's footsteps, though he is not quite convinced that this is the career for him. After the College Ball, Benny and Jack begin a relationship, Eve starts to date Aidan, a friend of Jack's, and Nan becomes involved with the much older Simon Westward, who the group ran into as they entered the dance and whom Nan \\"accidentally\\" arranged to run into at a lunch. While Benny is able to resist a physical relationship with Jack, Nan is not and believes that Simon truly loves her. When Benny's father dies suddenly, she is forced to suspend her university studies to take care of her mother who is devastated by her husband's passing, and to run the family shop. Sean Walsh attempts to woo her into marriage. Benny notices the accounts of the prosperous Hogan business...

In the sentence \\"He could tell that she was unhappy\\", the verb \\"tell\\" refers to the act of perceiving or recognizing a particular situation without necessarily being explicitly informed about it. In this context, \\"tell\\" is used to express that the person is able to understand that she is unhappy based on her actions, expressions, or other cues. 2. In the sentence \\"She told him how he did it\\", the verb \\"tell\\" refers to the act of giving information, instructions, or a narrative to someone in a direct manner. In this context, \\"tell\\" is used to express that she is explicitly conveying information about how he did something. Thus, the verb \\"tell\\" is not used to mean the same thing in these two sentences.

Who did the grandson of the Earl of Sunderland (from 1822-1840) marry? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, one must first identify the grandson of the Earl of Sunderland during the specified time period (1822-1840) and then determine who he married. The Earl of Sunderland from 1822-1840 was Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer (1786-1857). He was married to Lady Esther Acklom, but we aren’t looking for his spouse, but rather the spouse of his grandson. Charles Spencer and Lady Esther Acklom had several children, but three sons: John Spencer, Frederick Spencer, and George Spencer. As the eldest son, John Spencer (1820-1854) would have traditionally inherited the title upon his father's death; however, he died before his father. John Spencer did not have any children, so we'll focus on the other two sons. Frederick Spencer (1798-1857) became the 4th Earl Spencer after his older brother's death. Frederick married twice, first to Elizabeth Poyntz and then to Adelaide Horatia Seymour. He had several children, but for the purposes of this question, we will focus on the eldest child from each marriage. 1. Georgiana Frances Spencer (1823-1904) was the daughter of Frederick Spencer and Elizabeth Poyntz. 2. Charles Robert Spencer (1857–1922) was the grandson of Frederick Spencer, being the son of Frederick and Adelaide Horatia Seymour. He later became the 6th Earl Spencer. Considering the question asks for the grandson of the Earl of Sunderland, Charles Robert Spencer is our focus. He married Margaret Baring (1868-1906) in 1887. Margaret Baring was the daughter of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, and Louisa Emily Bulteel. In conclusion, the grandson of the Earl of Sunderland from 1822-1840, namely Charles Robert Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer, married Margaret Baring in 1887."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that was almost alone in their dislike at the 1914 Paris performance? The dress rehearsal, with Debussy, Ravel, other musicians and critics among those present, passed without incident. However, the following evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal abuse of the work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote \\"The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than the picture of the stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still incredible to me that he actually brought the orchestra through to the end.\\" The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux \\"at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor\\". The company presented the Rite during its London season a few weeks later. The Times reported that although there was \\"something like a hostile reception\\" at the first London performance, the final performance in the season \\"was received with scarcely a sign of opposition\\". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to The Rite of Spring.Monteux believed that most of the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as \\"knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down\\". With the composer's agreement Monteux presented a concert performance in Paris in April 1914. Saint-Saëns, who was present, declared Stravinsky mad and left in a rage, but he was almost alone in his dislike. At the end Stravinsky was carried shoulder-high from the theatre after what he described as \\"the most beautiful performance that I have had of the Sacre du printemps\\". That performance was part of a series of \\"Concerts Monteux\\", presented between February and April 1914, in which Monteux conducted the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in a wide range of symphonic and concertante works,...

I need to get to a meeting . : -)I had wanted to go for a few hours Friday night but no one would go and my eyelids were too heavy to go by myself . I figured a few hours of fun would be good for me and maybe I 'd continue my hot streak . OPTIONS: * I was tired and needed to sleep .; * I had a date .; * None of the above choices .; * I needed to clean my house .; Q: What may be the reason for not going out Friday night ?","completion":"From the information provided, it seems that the main reason for not going out on Friday night was a combination of factors that ultimately led to the decision to stay in. 1. No one else was available to go: Sometimes the motivation to go out is tied to the company and the shared experience. The desire to go out on Friday night was tempered by the fact that no one else was available to join in on the fun, which could have made the prospect of going out less appealing. 2. Tiredness: It is mentioned that the individual's eyelids were too heavy, implying that they were quite tired. This would make it difficult not only to enjoy going out, but also to stay awake while doing so. Feeling tired may have impacted the willingness to go out alone, as sleep became a more appealing option under the circumstances. 3. A potential continuation of a hot streak: The individual mentions the possibility of continuing their hot streak if they were to go out, suggesting that they may have had recent successes in social or other activities. Seeking excitement and positive experiences are natural reasons for wanting to go out and socialize. However, in this case, the tiredness and lack of companionship may have been stronger factors that influenced the decision to stay home instead. While the provided options of needing to sleep, having a date, and needing to clean the house could also be valid reasons for not going out on Friday night, the key factors at play here seem to be the unavailability of friends, tiredness, and the possibility of a less enjoyable experience due to going on their own. Therefore, the most accurate choice from the given options would likely be: * I was tired and needed to sleep. This choice captures the impact of tiredness on the decision-making process, but it is important to remember that it was not the sole reason for staying home on Friday night. The absence of friends to share the experience with and the influence of fatigue together largely contributed to the choice of staying in rather than going out."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"Climate change, as a result of human activities, can be considered as a process with multiple steps. Given that your question references the supposed perturbation's impact on the steps of this process, it is important to understand each step and evaluate how the perturbation would affect less global warming. The steps of the process as you've outlined are: 1. Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) 2. Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enters the atmosphere 3. The make-up of the atmosphere changes 4. Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere 5. The Earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy 6. Human beings cut down trees 7. Human beings do not re-plant the trees 8. Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 9. The extra trapped energy starts to change the Earth's short-term weather 10. Eventually, the long-term climate patterns start to change Now let's consider the potential perturbations: a) Directly impacting a step of the process b) Indirectly impacting a step of the process c) Not impacting any step of the process To promote less global warming, the perturbation would need to be actively and positively influencing the processes, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions or increased carbon capture. a) Directly impacting a step of the process: Examples of direct impacts on the process could include decreasing fossil fuel consumption by using alternative energy sources (Step 1), utilizing carbon capture technologies (Step 2), or increasing afforestation and reforestation efforts (Steps 6 and 7). These direct impacts would intervene in the process and reduce the overall effect of human activities on the atmosphere and climate change, ultimately leading to less global warming. b) Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Indirectly impacting a step of the process involves altering certain factors that positively affect the steps, but without directly intervening in them. Examples of indirect impacts may include implementing policies to encourage the use of renewable energy and discourage fossil fuel dependency (Step 1), offering incentives for reforestation or afforestation projects (Steps 6 and 7), or promoting awareness and behavioral changes to reduce carbon footprints (Steps 1, 6, and 7). These indirect impacts could generate a positive influence on the process and contribute to less global warming as a result. c) Not impacting any step of the process: This option implies that the perturbation would not have any effect on the identified steps, neither directly nor indirectly. In this case, the perturbation would not contribute to reducing global warming, as it would not influence any of the contributing factors. In conclusion, if the goal is to achieve less global warming, the perturbation should either directly or indirectly impact a step of the process, positively altering the factors contributing to climate change and, as a result, limiting its overall effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\"? , can you please find it? The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person that James H.

No matter which country you visit, no matter which grade you are in, you may not learn art, geography, chemistry or Chinese, but you always learn math. Why is this so? How come so many students hate math, and yet cannot avoid learning it in school? Jenny Sanders, a high school student in California, asks, \\"What good do we get from learning math? We can use computers to compute numbers, and we can use computers to store information. I think learning math at school is a waste of time.\\" However, there is much more to math than just learning to add and subtract numbers. In fact, math is not so much about calculation as it is about learning to think logically and solving problems. Of course, Jenny was right that we can use computers to do calculations, but how would we even know how to use the computer if we can't think logically? In short, computers are only tools when solving problems. For example, imagine you are a cook and must serve dinner to 100 guests.

In Russian, the word for \\"differences\\" is \\"различия.\\" The word order in this sentence is the same as in English. 2. \\"are\\" = \\"есть\\" - This is the verb, in this case, it is \\"to be\\" in third person plural. However, in Russian, often the verb \\"to be\\" (быть) is omitted when it links the subject and the predicate, only used in past and future tenses. So in this case, we don't include the equivalent verb \\"есть\\" in the translation. 3. \\"highly\\" = \\"крайне\\" - This is an adverb used to intensify the meaning of the adjective that follows, \\"instructive.\\" The appropriate Russian adverb for \\"highly\\" is \\"крайне.\\" 4. \\"instructive\\" = \\"познавательны\\" - This is the adjective, which reflects the key characteristic of the differences mentioned. The Russian word for \\"instructive\\" is \\"познавательный\\" in its masculine form, but since it modifies the plural noun \\"различия,\\" it will take on the plural form and become \\"познавательны.” So, putting it all together, we have \\"Различия крайне познавательны,\\" which translates to \\"The differences are highly instructive.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, suggests that if more plants die in soft mud, it would likely lead to an increase in fossil formation. This hypothesis would have a direct effect on the process of fossil formation. When more plants die in soft soil or mud, there is an increased supply of organic material that could eventually become fossils. As sediment continues to build up over the remains, the likelihood of these organic materials being preserved and not decomposing completely increases. This provides a better environment for fossilization to occur. Over time, the remains will continue to decompose, leaving only trace amounts of the original organic material. These remaining parts are gradually replaced with minerals, ultimately leading to the formation of fossils. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in plants dying in soft mud would lead to more fossils forming. This is due to the increased supply of organic material and the better conditions for preservation and fossilization.

First, the story was very slow, like a snail crawling on the ground. It took a long time for anything to happen, and it made me feel very sleepy instead of excited. The dinosaurs just wandered around, doing the same thing every day, and they didn't go on any fun adventures. Second, the animation was not very good. The dinosaurs looked like they were made out of old, crumpled paper, and they didn't move very smoothly. It was like watching a puppet show, where the puppets don't look very real. Finally, the music was not fun at all. It was the same tune over and over again, and it didn't make me feel happy or excited to watch the dinosaurs on their boring journey.

They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. Now, I have a new situation: Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior.

Note that you don't need to write a complete sentence as a summary. Q: I was under the impression when I bought this at our local pet supply store (based on salesperson's advice) that this bone, while edible, would take several days of working on to be consumed. Great. It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state. I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes. Just one end was left. I had bought her the largest \\"souper\\" size. After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it. Yes it's a \\"treat\\", but at 6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often. Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down. I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog. I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out. All for a LOT less money. That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for \\"my dog loved it\\". It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend.

I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian? Are we pointing fingers at ourselves? In the end, we are all in the same team. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about the man's actions? Options: A. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of it B. His discretionary efforts that brought a change C. not enough information D. He just turned around Answer:","completion":"B.

This will provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the emotions and cognitive effects that occur when someone hosts an event or gathering. Step 2: Collect testimonies from hosts and guests Gather testimonies from hosts and guests of various events to understand how hosting a successful event might have positively impacted their emotions and well-being. This evidence will help demonstrate how hosting can result in feelings of satisfaction, achievement, and happiness. Step 3: Evaluate the role of social connections in hosting Explore the role of social connections in hosting, as hosting often involves one person or a group bringing people together. Research on social connections and the potential positive impacts it has on mental health and well-being can support the claim that hosting fosters a 'feel-good' factor. Step 4: Analyze the physiological effects of positive emotions Research and gather evidence on the physiological effects of positive emotions that may arise during hosting, such as the release of endorphins, oxytocin, or serotonin. These hormones play a role in boosting mood and creating a 'feel-good' factor in the body. Step 5: Assess the role of personal growth and skills development Evaluate how hosting can contribute to personal growth and skills development, such as improved communication, leadership, and problem-solving abilities. The accomplishment of developing these skills can contribute to the 'feel-good' factor, as individuals can feel proud of their achievements and growth. Step 6: Compile case studies of successful hosting experiences Collect and analyze case studies of various hosting experiences where the hosts have reported feeling good about their event and its impact on them.

Write an article based on this summary: Spanish researchers have created a robot posing as a 14-year-old girl to spot paedophiles in online chatrooms.","completion":"Title: Online Sting: Spanish Researchers Develop Robot Posing as 14-Year-Old Girl to Catch Predatory Chatters Introduction In an increasingly digital-focused world, safeguarding children from online predators has become an exigent need. Social media platforms and chatrooms have provided an ideal breeding ground for the proliferation of online predators. In a bid to monitor and identify individuals who engage in predatory behavior with minors online, a team of Spanish researchers have created a groundbreaking new tool: a robot posing as a 14-year-old girl to trap pedophiles in online chatrooms. The Development of the Chatbot The Spanish research team, recognizing the need for advanced technology to tackle the soaring cases of online predatory behavior, devised a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) robot to infiltrate online chatrooms. The chatbot, designed to pose as a 14-year-old girl named \\"Sweetie 2.0\\", is equipped with a powerful algorithm and programmed with the ability to identify and communicate with potential predators, without raising suspicion. In essence, the groundbreaking chatbot mimics casual teenage conversation in order to avoid detection, continuously improving its conversational abilities by learning from the chats it partakes in. To create a realistic online persona, the chatbot's developers diligently conducted a linguistic analysis of teenage chats, incorporating colloquial expressions and internet slang that a typical 14-year-old would employ. Consequently, the AI-driven system effectively lures in individuals seeking to exploit minors for illegal or unethical purposes. How the Chatbot Identifies and Entraps Predators One of the most crucial aspects of this innovative chatbot is its ability to effectively identify predators. To accomplish this, the chatbot employs intelligent algorithms that assess the likelihood of specific users engaging in illicit behavior, such as grooming minors for sexual purposes. These algorithms analyze several crucial factors, including the language used by the interlocutor, personal information exchanged, the age difference between the individuals, and the overall tone of the conversation. Once the chatbot has identified an online predator, it continues to interact with the individual, engaging them in a conversation with the aim of gathering sufficient evidence for identifying and prosecuting the offender. The entity responsible for the chatbot's deployment, typically a law enforcement agency, can then use the evidence acquired by the AI system to launch an investigation before proceeding with prosecution, thereby spearheading the crackdown against online child exploitation. Advantages and Challenges The Sweetie 2.0 chatbot offers a myriad of advantages in combating online child exploitation. Here are a few: 1. Continuous Monitoring: The chatbot is capable of constant activity and does not require rest, enabling regular surveillance of chatrooms. 2. Scalable Operations: The chatbot can address various online chatrooms simultaneously, allowing law enforcement to cover a broader spectrum of potential threats. 3. Swift Execution: The chatbot helps in accelerating investigations by swiftly identifying potential threats, significantly reducing the time required for evidence gathering. However, the AI chatbot also presents some challenges: 1. Ethical Concerns: The chatbot's integration in chatrooms has raised certain ethical concerns, particularly surrounding entrapment and privacy. The issue of whether individuals are being unfairly provoked and baited into committing crimes, as well as the general online surveillance, poses a significant challenge. 2. Legal Framework: As the use of AI technology within law enforcement is still a relatively new concept, certain legal frameworks and regulations need to be adapted for its effective integration. Conclusion The Spanish researchers' development of the AI chatbot represents a substantial leap in the fight against online child exploitation. The cutting-edge technology provides law enforcement with a new avenue to identify and prosecute offenders. However, it is imperative that ethical and legal challenges are addressed to ensure that this technological advancement achieves its intended goal, safeguarding the well-being of minors in an increasingly digital world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:What is the first name of the person who was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self-restraint? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Allied invasion of Sicily began on 10 July 1943, with Lieutenant General George S. Patton leading 90,000 men of the Seventh United States Army in a landing near Gela, Scoglitti, and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery's British 8th Army landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took Palermo after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well. As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of the Sicily operation and Patton's friend and commanding officer, had long known of Patton's colorful leadership style, and also knew that Patton was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self-restraint.

Hello, little one! Today, we are going to answer a fun question about a player named Murray and the number of games he played in two different years - 1994 and 1995. Let's turn this into a little story to make it easy for you to understand. Once upon a time, in 1994, there was a sports player named Murray. He loved playing games and participated in many of them. People enjoyed watching him play because he was very skilled and talented. Then, in 1995, Murray decided that he wanted to play even more games. So, he played and played, and people kept wondering how many more games he played that year compared to the 1994 season. Let's help them find the answer! First things first: we need to find out how many games Murray played in 1994. Let's say he played 20 games in that season. Now, we need to figure out how many games he played in 1995. Let's imagine Murray played 35 games in the 1995 season. To see how many more games he played in 1995 when compared to 1994, we have to do a little bit of math. But don't worry! It's really easy and fun. Here's what we need to do: 1. Take the number of games Murray played in 1995 (35 games) 2. Minus the number of games Murray played in 1994 (20 games) Now let's subtract: 35 games (from the 1995 season) - 20 games (from the 1994 season) = 15 games So, Murray played 15 more games in the 1995 season compared to the 1994 season. Yay, we found the answer! Murray must have been very happy that he got to play even more games in 1995. And that's the end of our little story. I hope you enjoyed it and now understand how we figured out the difference in the number of games Murray played in those two years. Remember, comparing numbers can be a lot of fun, and it can help us learn interesting things about people, sports, or many other topics!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose thoughts on what inspired him to such an individual mode of expression art historians have struggled with? Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay.

Q:It often happens that a number of applicants with almost the same qualifications and experience all apply for the same position. In their educational background, special skills and work experience, there is little, if anything, to choose between half a dozen candidates. How then does the employer make a choice? Usually on the basis of an interview. There are many arguments for and against the interview as a way of selection. The main argument against it is that it results in a wholly _ decision. As often as not, employers do not choose the best candidate. They choose the candidate who makes a good first impression on them. Some employers, of course, reply to this argument by saying that they have become so experienced in interviewing staff that they are able to make a good assessment of each candidate's likely performance. The main argument in favor of the interview is that an employer is concerned not only with a candidate's ability, but with his or her suitable personality for the particular work situation. Many employers, for example, will overlook occasional mistakes from their secretary if she has a pleasant personality. It is perhaps true to say, therefore, that the real purpose of an interview is not to assess the assessable aspects of each candidate but to make a guess at the things that are hard to measure, such as personality, character and social ability. Unfortunately, both for the employers and applicants for jobs, there are many people of great ability who simply do not interview well. There are also, of course, people who interview extremely well, but are later found to be very unsatisfactory employees. Candidates who interview well tend to be quietly confident, but never boastful , direct and straightforward in their questions and answers; cheerful and friendly, but never over-familiar; and sincerely enthusiastic and optimistic. Candidates who interview badly tend to be either very shy or over-confident. They either talk too little or never stop talking. They are either over polite or a bit rude.

So, the task here is to read the provided text carefully and to determine which option—A) different purposes in the interview, B) different experiences in interviews, C) different standards of selection, or D) different ways of selection—best fits the blank space in the sentence \\"People argue over the interview mainly because they have _.\\" The text talks about the varied opinions employers and candidates have on the interview process as a selection tool, stating that the arguments are centered on whether or not the process is an effective way of determining a candidate's suitability for a position. This suggests a difference not in the interview's purpose, nor in their individual experiences, but in the way they think selection should be rightfully carried out. Therefore, considering the given options and the overall context of the text, the most appropriate one to complete the sentence is D) \\"different ways of selection\\". The sentence would read: \\"People argue over the interview mainly because they have different ways of selection.\\" This conclusion is drawn, as the passage indicates that not everyone agrees on the interview being the correct or only method of selection—some may believe in assessing personality and likability through interviews, while others may emphasize more on educational background, special skills, and work experience. Thus, their ways or methods of selection differ, leading to arguments over the validity and reliability of interviews as a selection tool."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Giants Tie Mark and Stifle Eagles With 12 Sacks “Sacks come in bunches, man,” Umenyiora said with a heavy dose of understatement. He tried to play down his numbers, but teammates needled him on the sideline in the closing moments of the game. “They were like, ‘It’s like a video game for you out there,’” Umenyiora said. The Giants allowed 97 points in the first two and a half games of the season, but only 3 in the past game and a half. The unit of the first-year defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, who spent the previous eight seasons as an assistant for the Eagles, appeared to take hold at the perfect time. A week earlier, in a 56-21 victory over Detroit, McNabb completed 21 of 26 for 381 yards, with four touchdowns and no interceptions. Against the Giants, McNabb completed 15 of 31 passes for 138 yards. The dozen sacks accounted for 62 yards in losses, leaving the Eagles only 76 net yards passing. The Eagles’ offense was helpless against a Giants defense gaining confidence with nearly every snap. But it was also short-handed because of a slew of injured players, most of them late, surprising scratches from the lineup. Most notably, running back Brian Westbrook, the league leader in yards from scrimmage through three games, did not dress for the game because of a nagging abdominal strain. Left tackle William Thomas’s absence because of a sore knee forced the backup Winston Justice to make his first N.F.L. start. Umenyiora, from the right end position, picked on Justice for most of his sacks, and other defensive linemen took turns pushing, pulling and throwing McNabb to the Giants Stadium turf. Umenyiora had never recorded more than two sacks in a game, and had just one sack in his previous eight regular-season games. Defenders entered the Eagles’ offensive backfield from all directions, but the Giants were surprised that the Eagles left Justice alone to fight off the onslaught. Philadelphia made few attempts to double-team Umenyiora. “Maybe they figured things would go a different way,” said linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka, who often played on the line of scrimmage and had three sacks. “Who knows? The bottom line is, we’ve got Osi on our team.” Still, the score was tighter than the game felt. The Giants’ offense, rewarded frequently with good field position, was consistent only in squandering chances. The Giants scored their only offensive touchdown midway through the second quarter when quarterback Eli Manning arced a pass to the left side of the end zone. The 6-foot-5 receiver Plaxico Burress snagged it over the top of cornerback Sheldon Brown, who is 7 inches shorter. A long first-quarter march ended with a missed 34-yard field-goal attempt by Lawrence Tynes. A second-quarter drive reached Philadelphia’s 15-yard line, but Manning threw an interception into the hands of linebacker Omar Gaither while trying to complete a short pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. A third-quarter drive reached the 10-yard line, but ended with a field goal and a 10-0 lead with 2 minutes 3 seconds left in the period. That is when the defense took control of the scoreboard. On the next play, McNabb fumbled, the ball appearing to brush fullback Thomas Tapeh’s elbow as McNabb retreated. Mitchell jumped on the loose ball, scrambled to his feet and ran 17 yards into the end zone. “Comfort, confidence,” Mitchell succinctly explained when asked about the transformation of the team’s defense. Tynes missed the extra-point attempt by hitting the upright, leaving the Giants with a 16-0 lead entering the fourth quarter. The Giants’ defense did the rest. The Eagles managed their only points on a 53-yard field goal by David Akers early in the fourth quarter. The next time they got the ball, Kiwanuka and Umenyiora sacked McNabb on consecutive plays — the first setting the team record for sacks in a game, the next giving Umenyiora the individual mark. Strahan’s sack, midway through the second quarter, pushed his career total to 133 ½. That broke the official franchise mark he shared for nearly a year with the former linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Strahan celebrated by pointing two fingers skyward into the darkness as Taylor watched from the sideline. But Taylor’s total of 132 ½ does not include the 9 ½ he notched as a rookie in 1981, because the N.F.L. did not count sacks as an official statistic until 1982. Taylor playfully reminded Strahan that he “has some more work to do.” The best chance for the Eagles to score a touchdown came just before the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. But on fourth-and-18 from the Giants’ 24-yard line, McNabb was sacked, appropriately and predictably, by Umenyiora. Fans rose to their feet as McNabb fell. A new defense had been christened, and a season was flush with renewed expectations.

Answer: The answer is:","completion":"No, this product review is not positive. The reviewer clearly expresses dissatisfaction and frustration at various aspects of the transaction, from ordering to delivery and product quality. These aspects form a negative overall evaluation of the product and service provided by the company. The disappointment starts with the shipping process. The reviewer notes that they paid for 2-day shipping but the product arrived 4 days late, meaning the company failed to meet the expectations set by their shipping promise. Moreover, the reviewer raises the issue of being charged 30 dollars for a service that was not delivered as promised, indicating a perceived lack of value for money. Next, regardless of the delivery delay, the reviewer was notified that the order had been cancelled because the company couldn't meet the delivery date. Subsequently, they purchased a replacement product from elsewhere. However, to their surprise, the original order still arrived even though they got a cancellation notice. This confusion and lack of clear communication further contributes to the reviewer's negative sentiment. Finally, upon receiving the product, they express that they were 'very disappointed at what it actually was for the money charged', suggesting that the product's quality or functionality did not match up to its cost, thus highlighting a discrepancy between the expectations and reality. Their decision to 'never buy anything through this company again' serves as a direct declaration of their dissatisfaction and a portrayal of the profound impact of their negative experience. This statement also suggests a low level of trust in the company due to their negative encounter. In conclusion, posing frustration, dissatisfaction, and disappointment, the review is decidedly negative. It serves as feedback and warning to other potential customers about their possible experiences. It also suggests areas for improvement for the company in the areas of shipping, communication, and product quality."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets. 3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clichés, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground \\"playing Wickerman\\". The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison. I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Now, let's go back to our equation and do the same thing. Instead of apples, we have \\"c\\" in our equation. So, we will have 6 * c = 48. Now, let's think about this equation (6 * c = 48): If you have 6 candies and you want to divide them equally among some number of kids, how many candies will each kid get? You have 48 candies to distribute, so you divide 48 candies by the 6 candies you have: 48 / 6 = 8. So the answer to the equation is: c = 8.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years after Hernán Cortés left to explore the Mexican coast did Tenochtitlan fall to the Spanish?","completion":"Title: The Fall of Tenochtitlan: How Long Did It Take After Cortés Left for Spaniards to Conquer Mexico? Introduction: Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador, embarked on an expedition to explore the coast of Mexico in the early 16th century. This journey paved the way for the eventual Spanish conquest of the mighty Aztec Empire, with its capital Tenochtitlan at the heart of the struggle. The timing of these events is vital in understanding the sequence of events that led to the fall of the Aztec Empire. In this article, we will examine the duration between Hernán Cortés' departure from Spain and the demise of Tenochtitlan. Step 1: Establish the date Hernán Cortés started his expedition. Cortés initiated his journey to explore the Mexican coast in 1518. He was given the responsibility of establishing initial contact and trade relations with the indigenous people of the region. In November 1518, he sailed to Mexico with a fleet of 11 ships and hundreds of soldiers, starting his exploration of the unknown territories. Step 2: Identify the year Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish. The British historian Hugh Thomas records that the fall of Tenochtitlan occurred on August 13, 1521. After months of siege warfare, Spanish forces led by Hernán Cortés and their indigenous allies managed to breach the city's defenses, capturing the Aztec ruler, Cuauhtémoc. The fall of Tenochtitlan marked the end of the mighty Aztec Empire. Step 3: Calculate the time gap between Cortés' departure and Tenochtitlan's fall. To determine the time gap between Hernán Cortés' departure and the fall of Tenochtitlan, we need to calculate the difference between 1518 and 1521. Here is the calculation: 1521 (Fall of Tenochtitlan) - 1518 (Cortés' expedition starts) = 3 years Conclusion: In summary, it took three years after Hernán Cortés left to explore the Mexican coast for the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan to fall to the Spanish forces. This period saw an intricate sequence of events, including the formation of alliances with local tribes, battles, and the instigation of the smallpox outbreak among the indigenous people, which contributed to the ultimate defeat of the Aztec Empire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen. Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\". Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen. But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside. Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint. When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground. Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline. Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again. However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald. When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\" The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.\\"?

Write a summary based on this article: PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Wednesday renamed its Pacific Command the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, in a largely symbolic move underscoring the growing importance of India to the Pentagon, U.S. officials said. U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis arrives to testify before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing on funding for the Department of Defense, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas U.S. Pacific Command, which is responsible for all U.S. military activity in the greater Pacific region, has about 375,000 civilian and military personnel assigned to its area of responsibility, which includes India. “Relationships with our Pacific and Indian Ocean allies and partners have proven critical to maintaining regional stability,” U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in prepared remarks. “In recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, today we rename the U.S. Pacific Command to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,” Mattis said. He was speaking during a change of command ceremony. Admiral Philip Davidson was assuming leadership of the command from Admiral Harry Harris, who is President Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to South Korea. The renaming does not mean additional assets will be sent to the region at this time, but rather recognizes India’s increasing military relevance for the United States. In 2016, the United States and India signed an agreement governing the use of each other’s land, air and naval bases for repair and resupply, a step toward building defense ties as they seek to counter the growing maritime assertiveness of China. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said they had noted the name change. “We will continue to pay attention to developments,” he told a regular monthly news briefing. The United States is also keen to tap into India’s large defense market. It has emerged as India’s No. 2 weapons supplier, closing 15 billion worth of deals over the last decade. Mattis has been pushing for a waiver for countries like India, after Trump signed a law last year which said that any country trading with Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors would face sanctions. “I think India and the relationship with the United States is the potentially most historic opportunity we have in the 21st-century and I intend to pursue that quite rigorously,” Davidson, the incoming head of the command, said last month. However, experts said the name change would mean little unless it was tied to a broader strategy. “Renaming PACOM is ultimately a symbolic act ... (it) will have a very limited impact unless the U.S. follows through with a significant array of initiatives and investments that reflect a wider aperture,” said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under President Barack Obama. ||||| (CNN) The US announced Wednesday that it would rebrand the command responsible for overseeing US military operations in Asia, a move that comes amid heightened tensions with China over the militarization of the South China Sea. US Pacific Command will now be called US Indo-Pacific Command, Secretary of Defense James Mattis said while speaking at a change of command ceremony in Hawaii, where the command's headquarters is located. \\"In recognition of the increasing connectivity of the Indian and Pacific Oceans today we rename the US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific Command,\\" Mattis said. \\"It is our primary combatant command, it's standing watch and intimately engaged with over half of the earth's surface and its diverse populations, from Hollywood, to Bollywood, from polar bears to penguins,\\" Mattis said of the command. Adm. Harry Harris, who oversaw US military operations in the region until Wednesday, has been tapped by President Donald Trump to serve as the US ambassador to South Korea. Adm. Phillip Davidson will now lead the Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees some 375,000 US military and civilian personnel.

This change is mostly a symbol to show that India is becoming more important to the U.S. military. The Indo-Pacific Command helps keep peace in a large part of the world, including India. By changing the name, the United States wants to show that it's working well with countries in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This change doesn't mean there will be more military stuff in that area, but it tells people that India's help in the military is important to the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She is ambitious for him, but he wants to do work more imaginative than the commercial buildings he's been designing. He meets with Roger Altar, an author, to discuss building a house that will be an \\"experiment\\" and something Coe wants to do more of, something original. Maggie Gault is one of his neighbors whose son is friends with his. She tells Larry she has seen some of his previous houses and thinks that the more unconventional houses are the best. This encouragement is what he needs from his wife but hasn't been able to get. Both Larry and Maggie grow dissatisfied in their marriages. Larry's wife is too hard-headed and practical and Maggie's husband isn't interested in having sex with her. So they have an affair that involves meeting in secret. They both know what they're doing is wrong, and they are devoted to their children. Felix Anders is a neighbor who snoops around and finds out about their affair. His leering and insinuations make Larry realize the risks he's taking. He tells Maggie that they shouldn't see each other for a while. Felix, in the meantime, makes a play for Larry's wife. In a way, Felix is a personification of the tawdriness of Larry and Maggie's affair. After her near-rape by Felix, Eve wises up and realizes that Larry has been unfaithful. She confronts him. They agree to stay together and move to Hawaii, where Larry has been offered a job to design a city. Altar's house is finished but still empty. Maggie drives up to take a look at it. Larry shows up and they talk about how they can never be together. Larry wishes he and Maggie could live in the house and if they did, he would dig a moat around it and never leave it.

The original description - \\"A man in a black hat and tan jacket walking across the street\\" - does not provide any information about the speed of the man walking. In order to make such a conclusion, we would need additional details about the man's walking speed or behavioral cues that suggest he is walking slowly. For example, if the description indicated that the man was taking leisurely steps or was traversing a great deal of time to cross the street, then we could draw the conclusion that he was walking slowly.

Analyzing the information given in each sentence, here are the details we have at hand: - The man is in a black hat and tan jacket. - The man is walking across the street. These details give us an understanding of the person's appearance and actions, but not an indicator of his walking speed. To assume that he is walking slowly would be adding information not provided in the original description and may lead us to construct an inaccurate mental image of the scene.

During 2002, the average remained subdued without making substantial gains due to the stock market downturn of 2002 as well as the lingering effects of the dot-com bubble. In 2003, the Dow held steady within the 7,000 to 9,000-point level range by the early 2000s recession, the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) and the Iraq War. But by December of that year, the Dow remarkably returned to the 10,000 mark. In October 2006, four years after its bear market low, the DJIA set fresh record theoretical, intra-day, daily close, weekly, and monthly highs for the first time in almost seven years, closing above the 12,000 level for the first time on the 19th anniversary of Black Monday (1987) (1987). On February 27, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.3% (415.30 points), its biggest point drop since 2001. The initial drop was caused by a global sell-off after SSE Composite experienced a Chinese correction, yet by April 25, the Dow passed the 13,000 level in trading and closed above that milestone for the first time. On July 19, 2007, the average passed the 14,000 level, completing the fastest 1,000-point advance for the index since 1999. One week later, a 450-point intra-day loss, owing to turbulence in the U.S. Subprime lending market and the soaring value of the Chinese yuan, initiated another correction falling below the 13,000 mark, about 10% from its highs.

This system effectively prevents fogging and provides better visibility during cold weather by creating a double-glazed window, allowing you to maintain a clear view of your surroundings. Additionally, opt for a helmet with proper insulation and adequate vents to ensure both warmth and breathability, preventing moisture buildup and maintaining optimal temperature at all times. When selecting your motorbike gear, it's crucial to focus on layering and choosing materials that provide excellent thermal insulation while remaining lightweight and flexible. Start with moisture-wicking base layers, made of high-quality fabrics like merino wool or synthetic materials, which will keep you dry and ensure proper heat regulation. Compression garments can also be useful in promoting blood circulation and reducing fatigue during long rides. Next, consider investing in a mid-layer that allows for heat retention and breathability, such as fleece or other insulating materials. This layer should be comfortable without adding bulk, ensuring ease of movement and an overall good fit. An adjustable collar or turtleneck can also be helpful in sealing off openings, keeping your neck warm and minimizing exposure to chilly winds. For your outer layer, look for a high-quality, waterproof yet breathable jacket and pants, designed specifically for winter motorbike riding. These garments should come equipped with both thermal insulation and ventilation systems, allowing you to stay warm while keeping sweat and moisture at bay. Ensure that the garments have reinforced areas, such as elbows and knees, as well as adjustable cuffs and waistbands for optimal fit and protection. Gloves and boots, too, can significantly impact your winter motorbike riding experience. Select gloves with thermal insulation and waterproof capabilities that provide a comfortable grip on your bike's handlebars. A safe option would be gauntlet-style gloves, which extend up over your jacket sleeve, ensuring no cold air penetrates your hands. Similarly, choose waterproof boots with a strong grip, adequate insulation, and protection for your ankles. Maximizing visibility in challenging road conditions is also essential during winter rides. Opt for high-visibility or reflective wear, such as vests, jackets, and pants, to ensure your presence stands out to other motorists, reducing the risk of accidents. Adding reflective decals or tape can help enhance your visibility as well. Finally, invest in motorbike-specific winter accessories such as heated grips, handguard extensions, and waterproof seat covers to further enhance your comfort and safety during rides. By equipping yourself with the appropriate helmet, gear, and accessories, you can enjoy a safer and more comfortable winter motorbike riding experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But his magical world - where witches cast spells and castles float in the sky - is brought to life by hand. Nevertheless, Hayao Miyazaki is referred to as Japan's Walt Disney and considered by many to be the world's greatest living animator. This month, the 72-year-old Miyazaki announced his retirement. The Japanese animator has directed 11 animated full-length films over the past four decades, including the Oscar-winning Spirited Away (<<>> ) and his latest release, The Wind Rises (<<>> ), which tells the life story of a man who designed Japanese World War II fighter planes. Just as The Wind Rises shows, Miyazaki is well-known for his obsession with flight, especially human flight. Other striking aspects of Miyazaki's films include his themes of environmental protection and the horrors of war. Miyazaki's work is also famous for its lack of clearly defined good and evil characters. He sees the 21st century as a complex time when old norms need to be re-examined. As a storyteller, he is an inventor of fairy tales full of mystery. In the Miyazakian universe, wizards turn into birds of prey; young girls are transformed overnight into 90-year-old women; greedy parents are changed into pigs; and shooting stars become fire demons . As a visual artist, most of Miyazaki's grace comes from his vivid colors and lovingly drawn landscapes - a rolling meadow covered with flowers and shadowed by clouds, or a range of rocky hills rising toward snow-capped mountain peaks People attribute Miyazaki's success to his long pursuit of his hand-drawn technique, although in an interview with CNN he called himself an \\"extinct species\\" in the age of digital animation. A recent television documentary on the making of The Wind Rises showed a disappointed Miyazaki throwing a pile of drawings into the trash. He is said to have redrawn thousands of frames of the much-praised Princess Mononoke (<<>> ) when they did not meet his standards. But his huge... Question: What is the main idea of this article ?

Step 1: Define plasma lipoproteins Plasma lipoproteins are complex particles composed of lipids and proteins that transport lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, in the blood. They play a critical role in lipid metabolism and maintaining lipid homeostasis in our body. Step 2: Identify the four major types of plasma lipoproteins 1. Chylomicrons: Chylomicrons are the largest and least dense lipoproteins, primarily responsible for transporting dietary lipids (fats) from the intestine to other tissues in the body. They mainly carry triglycerides. 2. Very Low-Density Lipoproteins (VLDL): VLDL particles are synthesized in the liver and responsible for transporting endogenous lipids, primarily triglycerides, to peripheral tissues. VLDL particles also evolve into intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) and later Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL) as they lose triglycerides. 3. Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL): Also known as \\"bad cholesterol,\\" LDL lipoproteins primarily transport cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues. High levels of LDL increase the risk of atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. 4. High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL): Referred to as \\"good cholesterol,\\" HDL particles are involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which helps remove excess cholesterol from tissues, including the arterial wall, and return it to the liver for excretion. Higher levels of HDL are generally associated with a lower risk of heart disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Please answer this question : Which country causes more environmental problems? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Iraq causes more environmental problems than Iran due to its reliance on fossil fuels for electricity production. Burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases, contributing to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. These negative environmental impacts have significant consequences on human health, ecosystems, and the planet's climate. In contrast, Iran uses nuclear fission as its primary energy source for electricity production. While it is true that radioactive elements are limited and may eventually run out, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause other environmental problems typically associated with burning fossil fuels. The major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy is that it helps mitigate climate change and air pollution impacts. However, it is essential to consider other potential consequences of nuclear power, such as the risk of accidents, disposal of radioactive waste, and the potential for nuclear material to be used for nefarious purposes. Nevertheless, from an environmental perspective, the immediate impacts of fossil fuel usage are more harmful, and thus, Iraq's electricity production can be considered more environmentally detrimental than Iran's. It is important to note that moving towards cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, would help both countries minimize their environmental footprint and reduce their reliance on nonrenewable resources.

If you haven’t done that yet and you still have your iPhone, now’s a good time to set it up just in case. After you’ve made sure that your iPhone is not, in fact, in your jacket pocket, purse or the other room, your first step is to visit Apple’s iCloud website. Once you’ve logged in, hit the “Find My iPhone” button. The site will automatically load a map and note your iPhone’s location with a green dot. If you have multiple Apple devices attached to the same iCloud account, the site will prompt you to select which device you want to locate. At this point, it’s important to wait a few moments while your iPhone’s GPS adjusts and more accurately pinpoints itself on the map. Once you select the device, you can also monitor its battery life. One caveat here: If your iPhone’s battery is dead, Find My iPhone will only display the device’s last known location. Helpfully, Apple’s iOS 8 upgrade introduced a new feature that has your iPhone transmit its last known location just before its battery dies. Turn this on in Settings -> iCloud -> Find My iPhone -> Send Last Location. Sometimes, the map will show your iPhone in a general area within a block or two of its actual location. This should, however, be enough to remind you where you left the device. iCloud also allows you to play a loud, annoying noise from your iPhone to make it easier to find, even if it’s stuck on silent mode. As you search for your device, iCloud also lets you activate your iPhone’s “Lost Mode,” which locks it with a 4-digit pin so nobody can use it. It also gives you the option of displaying a custom distress message across the lock screen with essential contact information. More importantly, if you have credit cards synced to Apple Pay, Lost Mode disables all payment options. In a worst case scenario — like if your iPhone was stolen — you have the option of remotely erasing your phone, which is a lot like that scene in Argo when staffers at the American embassy start shredding and burning documents. Which is to say, if you’ve given up hope entirely, you can purge it of all personal data. These features are also available on Apple’s Find My iPhone iOS app. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how to use iCloud to find your lost iPhone.

Background: X is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977, among the first wave of American punk. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist/bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom and drummer D.J. Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid to late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s, and currently tours. Context: X then signed to Elektra in 1982 to release Under the Big Black Sun, which marked a slight departure from their trademark sound. While still fast and loud, with raw punk guitars, the album displayed evolving country leanings. The album was heavily influenced by the death of Cervenka's elder sister Mirielle (Mary) in a 1980 automobile accident. Three songs on the album (\\"Riding with Mary\\", \\"Come Back to Me\\" and the title track) all directly related to the tragedy. A fourth, a high-speed version of Al Dubin and Joe Burke's \\"Dancing with Tears in My Eyes\\", was, years later, indirectly attributed to Cervenka's mournful state of mind. The stark black-and-white cover art and title were also a reflection of the somber mood of the band during this time. Cervenka has said it is her favorite X album \\"You know, my favorite record is Under the Big Black Sun, so everything else is kind of . . . I'm saying if I had to sit down in a room and put on an X record--which I don't generally do--I have recently listened to some X records but I generally don't listen to myself--the record I would pick to listen to would be Under the Big Black Sun. In 1983, the band slightly redefined their sound with the release of the More Fun in the New World album, making X somewhat more polished, eclectic and radio-ready than on previous albums. With the sound moving away from punk rock, the band's rockabilly influence became even more noticeable, along with some new elements: funk on the track \\"True Love Pt. II\\", and Woody Guthrie-influenced folk protest songs like \\"The New World\\" and \\"I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts\\". The record received critical praise from Rolling Stone and Playboy, which had long been stalwart supporters of X and their sound. The Knitters, a side project, were composed of X minus Zoom, plus Alvin on guitar and Johnny Ray Bartel (of the Red Devils) on double bass, and released the Poor Little Critter on the Road album in 1985. The Knitters were devoted to folk and country music; their take on Merle Haggard's \\"Silver Wings\\" \\"may be the definitive version\\". Question: What was the sound of the album \\"More Fun in the New World\\"?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The sound of the album \\"More Fun in the New World\\" by X marked a shift in the band's musical direction while still retaining their punk rock origins. This album demonstrated a more polished, eclectic, and radio-ready sound compared to their previous albums. The band's rockabilly influence became more noticeable, and they incorporated new elements such as funk on the track \\"True Love Pt. II\\" and Woody Guthrie-influenced folk protest songs like \\"The New World\\" and \\"I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts\\". The album received critical acclaim from publications like Rolling Stone and Playboy, which had been supportive of X and their unique sound. In summary, \\"More Fun in the New World\\" showcased a more diverse and polished sound for X, while still retaining their punk rock roots and unique blend of musical influences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \\"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\\". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.A few minutes later, just after 10:00, an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building. Lieutenant Thơ, who had earlier urged Diệm to surrender, saying that he was sure that his uncle Đỗ Mậu, along with Đính and Khiêm, would guarantee their safety, wrote in his diary later \\"I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death\\".

Restaurant 's space was bright (large windows facing the parking lot and street), uncluttered, and attractive (shelf/bookcase with picture frames and a few knick-knacks gave the space a cozy atmosphere- don't know about the restroom as I didn't get a chance to visit it). I asked if we were to seat ourselves, and I was told that we were to order at the counter and that we could then seat anywhere we wanted to. I try to get a few suggestions wherever I go not only to check for allergens, but also for good customer service; it never sits well with me if staff members aren't able to suggest anything off of the menu. After hearing a few enthusiastic lunch suggestions from the cashier, I placed in our order: a Belgian waffle with fresh fruit toppings (peaches and berries) for Mom, and a combo of half a Reubenesque panini and a small mixed salad. It took about fifteen minutes before the food arrived, which gave us time to chit-chat and this was when I noticed the restaurant's surroundings. I thought it cool to be able to watch the two cooks prepare the orders behind the counter. My Mom LOVED the waffle with the fresh fruit toppings! Her plate arrived with two 4x4-inch waffles, one with peaches and the other with sliced strawberries, a slice of pineapple and an orange wedge, all sprinkled with powdered sugar. Mom sensed something was missing, and after asking for whipped cream, she and the waffles were fast friends. My small salad looked beautiful- mixed greens with glazed pecans, a few pear slices, and blue cheese crumbles, a slice of grilled foccacia bread and a side of citrus vinaigrette. My half-sandwich of shaved corned beef, swiss cheese, fresh sauerkraut on Acacia Cafe marble-rye bread looked tiny (Mom and I noticed the wee-portion right away), but it was full of flavor.

The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.\\" Answer:","completion":"Zeuxis's art style in Greek was primarily characterized by realistic naturalism (aletheia) and the accurate depiction of emotions (pathos) and character (ethos) within the Hellenistic art period. His works, such as the painting of grapes, were known for their deceptively lifelike appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Four Cs of 21st century learning, also known as the Four Cs or 4 Cs, are four skills that have been identified by the United States-based Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21) as the most important skills required for 21st century education: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. Can we draw the following conclusion? The 4 C's may go on to be the most important skills of the 22nd century.","completion":"The 4 Cs of 21st century learning—critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity—have indeed been identified as crucial skills for success in our modern, rapidly changing world. Given their importance in education today and contemporary work environments, it is worth considering the likelihood that these skills will remain essential or even grow in significance throughout the coming century. However, to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the future importance of the 4 Cs in the 22nd century, we must first analyze the function and relevance of each of these skills in detail and discuss potential changes in future societies. 1. Critical Thinking: Critical thinking is the ability to think in a clear, logical, and discerning manner, which includes problem-solving, rational analysis, and decision-making. In our modern world, where we are inundated with information, individuals must be adept at analyzing and evaluating information critically. As future societies become increasingly interconnected, and as the pace of technological innovation accelerates, the necessity for individuals to possess strong critical thinking skills in order to navigate complex issues will likely remain paramount. 2. Communication: Effective communication is the capacity to convey and understand thoughts, ideas, and information in verbal, written, or nonverbal form. As globalization continues and cross-cultural communication becomes even more prevalent, the ability to communicate at an advanced level will remain an indispensable skill. Avoiding miscommunication and fostering understanding between diverse populations will be critical in the 22nd century, particularly as new languages and dialects evolve, and the reliance on remote collaboration due to technological advancements may emphasize the importance of strong communication skills. 3. Collaboration: Collaboration is the ability to work harmoniously within a group and manage interpersonal relationships to accomplish a shared goal. In future societies, one can reasonably assume that individuals will need to coordinate with others, whether it is within diverse and dispersed teams or across language barriers. Integrating artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies into the workforce will also likely require enhanced collaboration skills that facilitate cooperation between humans and machines. 4. Creativity: Creativity is the ability to generate one's thoughts and ideas, think innovatively, and approach problems in an open-minded and unique manner. As the 22nd century brings forth challenges that humans have never faced before, creativity will be an indispensable skill. Furthermore, automation and robotics may take over tasks that require repetitive activities or manual labor, elevating the significance of creative and innovative aptitudes in the remaining human workforce. While it is impossible to predict the future landscape of education and work with absolute certainty, we can infer that the 4 Cs will continue to hold considerable importance in the 22nd century. The persistent evolution of artificial intelligence, technology, globalization, and cultural dynamics will likely amplify the necessity of these skills. However, it is also possible that new, unforeseen skills may emerge as vital components of future education and work. In any case, focusing on the development of critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity will undoubtedly help prepare individuals for success in the unpredictable world ahead in the 22nd century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is Jino Fort, back again, and I'm going to teach you how to krump stomp. Now krump stomps are not just stomp and stomp all over the floor, going everywhere, because that makes no sense. You'd only look stupid, just looking like a big monkey going out on the dance floor. So basically, krump stomps are [inaudible 0:20]. It's just like jazz, arm swings, and everything else you're supposed to do. It involves precision as well to the beat, and it's not supposed to be the loudest krump stomp either. So don't think if you stomp loud that you're doing it right. A lot of people get that confused. BOOM, they look crazy after that. No, it ends right there. But basically when you krump stomp it's supposed to be precise. At least have precision and don't stomp too loud, like make an effect, but like have it precise too. Like you're going to stomp, stop it at your heel, or your toe. So you can do another move that's very clean after that as well. You don't want to look crazy, stomping real hard trying to look all nice to get attention and then not have anything to do after that. So when you do it, kind of like set stance, go to your toe, go on your heel, use your right, you can go all the way around, hit, hit, hit. Hit, hit, hit, hit, have a combination if you will. Let me show you a simple routine highlighting the krump stomp. For your first move you're going to get kind of low, like kind of muscled. You're going to go one, and come up on your toe. Two, now when you drop it you're going to move your toe to the right, so three, four, five, and you're going to do like an arm swing. We're going back to arm swings again, out, so arm swings out. Stomp, is going to be seven. So let's do that again. Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and make sure you raise that left leg kind of high so you can make it look like you're doing something. Don't just look lazy. You don't want to look lazy, look like you're really into the move and you're doing something with it. So let's try it again. Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, toe, six, seven. Let's try it again, Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six seven. So now let's do it with music. ||||| Us Weekly’s “25 Things You Didn’t Know About Me” feature is usually a space for famous people and non-famous people to just say 25 sentences out loud, but in list form instead of an interview.

It is located on the western side of the country, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the \\"Rajasthan Desert\\" and \\"Great Indian Desert\\") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by the other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Rajasthan is an economically backward region of India and has the highest percentage of unemployed youth in North India. Rajasthan is divided into 9 regions; Ajmer State, Hadoti, Dhundhar, Gorwar, Shekhawati, Mewar, Marwar, Vagad and Mewat which are equally rich in its heritage and artistic contribution. These regions have a parallel history which goes along with that of the state. - Western India consists of the states of Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan along with the Union territory of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli of India. The region is highly industrialized, with a large urban population. Roughly, Western India is bounded by the Thar Desert in the northwest, the Vindhya Range in the north and the Arabian Sea in the west. A major portion of Western India shares the Deccan Plateau with South India.

As minors are generally excluded, the concept is frequently described as \\"universal adult suffrage\\". Many countries make an exception for small numbers of adults that are considered mentally incapable of voting. Other countries also exclude people convicted of serious crimes or people in jail, but this is considered a violation of a basic human right in an increasing number of countries. In some countries, including the United States, it is very difficult and expensive for convicted criminals to regain this right even after having served their jail sentence. In any case, where universal suffrage exists, the right to vote is not restricted by race, sex, belief, wealth, or social status. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

It is every bit as good as the rumors - full review to be posted in two parts. The Why: When I travel I do it primarily for two things - hockey and food - and when visiting the home of the winningest team in NHL history it only made sense to visit the most well-known restaurant in Montreal...twice...in the same night...sandwiching a game at the Bell Centre. Owned and operated by Martin Picard Au Pied de Cochon had been on my food bucket list for almost as long as a trip to see Les Habitants for obvious reasons...I just hoped my mother and picky aunt could find something on the menu they'd like. The Reservation: Having made mention of this above I'll admit the plan was a little convoluted, but it worked out perfectly - one reservation at 5:00pm for appetizers and entrees, a second reservation at 10:30pm for dessert, coffee, and maybe more. I knew we'd overeat. I was okay with this. The Space: Located on what is essentially a side street amongst other stores and eateries the wooded exterior of APdC is quite unassuming and arriving early parking was a cinch. With doors unlocked we were the first to arrive and given our choice of seats we opted for a spot up front near the window of the long and narrow space. Wooden and rustic with an open kitchen spanning nearly the entirety of the space up to a long bar in back the only thing \\"formal\\" about the space is the linen napkins and stemware - the rest feels like a cozy cabin and a tribute to many things Canadian. The Service: Superlative. From watching Chef Picard himself haul in a large case of Foie Gras and innumerable loaves of bread before stopping by to say hello to our primary server, a young blonde woman, everyone just seemed happy to be at Au Pied de Cochon - an atmosphere that was entirely in harmony with the food and extended from front of the house to the back both at 5:00pm and again at 10:30. With both the standard menu and a list of eight specials described at length and our time constraints noted with regard to preparation and presentation it would be hard to ask for better service than what we received at APdC - it was Michelin Star quality. The Food: Complimentary Bread and Butter, House Muddled Strawberry Lemonade, Six Appetizers, Two Entrees, Three Desserts, and Coffee. Fresh Bread with House butter: I have no idea where Picard gets his bread but they bring it in by the bushel and served up warm with unsalted butter the only challenge was not to eat too much. A crusty French baguette with good crunch and better chew plus a bit of salinity juxtaposing yeasty notes this was as good as much of the bread service in Paris. Foie gras cromesquis: Think of these as liquid foie gras nuggets. Order them. Eat them. Bask in the gluttony. Tomato Tart: Knowing my aunt would struggle with the meat-centric menu I also knew this would be right up her ally and as much as it may seem odd to order such a thing at Au Pied de Cochon I would strongly recommend it. Essentially nothing more than a buttery puff pastry topped with herbs, olive oil, a bit of gruyere, and incredibly fresh tomatoes the tart was acidic and bright yet creamy and balanced plus big enough to share and probably enough to serve as a meal for some. French Onion Soup: Another order fitting my aunt's palate, though certainly not traditional, was this pork and lard based French Onion soup. Generally not a fan of the classic form of this dish I think I actually enjoyed this dish the most of anyone at the table as the swine based broth was thick and full - almost like that of ramen - with plenty of fatty pork and root vegetables beneath the bubbling dome of cheese. Great on its own and more-so when used for dipping bread this is another great choice for those not wanting one of the more substantial plates on Picard's menu. \\"The Monte Cristo:\\" One of the daily specials I somehow talked my mother into ordering this and although she was hesitant it ended up being a hit with everyone at the table. Limited to only \\"about a dozen\\" sandwiches that evening and featuring thick maple-custard dredged brioche French toast topped with imported jambon, local turkey, and a blend of Gruyere and Comte plus spreads of guinea hen liver mousse, maple butter, apple jelly, and caramelized onions there was really no part of the palate that this enormous \\"appetizer\\" did not touch on and with a drizzle of maple syrup to finish the plate the biggest shock was that every flavor came through with aplomb. Certainly gluttonous but entirely delicious this and what followed certainly displayed Picard's propensity for 'shock n' awe' cuisine but honestly, it works. ...to be continued.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is a 1966 American comedy-drama film starring Don Knotts as Luther Heggs, a newspaper typesetter who spends a night in a haunted house, which is located in the fictitious community of Rachel, Kansas. The working title was \\"Running Scared\\". The title is presumably a humorous variation of the film \\"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\\" (1947). Hypothesis: Rachel, Kansas does not exist as it is in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis that Rachel, Kansas does not exist as it is in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken appears to be true. The paragraph explicitly states that the community of Rachel, Kansas is \\"fictitious,\\" meaning that it is an invented or imaginary place created for the purpose of the film's narrative. The film \\"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\\" is a comedy-drama from 1966 featuring Don Knotts as the main character, Luther Heggs, a newspaper typesetter who spends a night in a haunted house. The haunted house is situated in this imaginary town of Rachel, Kansas. As the paragraph also mentions that this title is \\"presumably a humorous variation\\" of another film, \\"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\\" (1947), the narrative and setting of the story is most likely fabricated for entertainment purposes rather than an accurate depiction of a real place. Furthermore, it is common for creators in the entertainment industry to create fictitious towns, cities, and locations for movies, television shows, books, and other forms of media. These fabricated settings provide the writers with more creative freedom and flexibility to construct a specific atmosphere or situation that suits the story and the intended audience. Therefore, given the information available in the paragraph and the broader context of fiction in media, the hypothesis that Rachel, Kansas does not exist as it is in \\"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\\" is true, as the town was created as a fictitious setting for the film's story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower. and a hint : No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Please answer this question : Would particles move slower or faster in object A than in object B?
