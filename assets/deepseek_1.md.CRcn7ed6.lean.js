At one such show, Arthur was examining a 1947 Pontiac Stretch Roadster when the owner, who was standing nearby, indicated that he was trying to sell the car. Bud, who stated that he had restored the Pontiac himself, told Arthur that (I) the car was restored using nothing but genuine Pontiac parts or parts that Bud had handmade himself. He said that (II) this is the finest restoration of a 1947 'Stretch' Roadster in the United States, and one of the two best in the world.' As they were discussing price, Bud pointed out that (III) this car has the original 'rearing horse' grille that was installed by the dealer on 1947 'Stretch' Roadsters. Arthur agreed to purchase the car for a considerable sum, and had it transported to his home. Later, he discovered that Bud had not been entirely truthful about the restoration. In his action for deceit, Arthur establishes that Bud knew, when he made statements I, II, and III, above, that each was false. Assuming that all the other elements of deceit are proven, which of the three statements will support Arthur's claims? A. I only. B. I and II. C. I and III. D. I, II, and III.

In response, the city council enacted an ordinance that required anyone soliciting for charitable contributions of any sort in any public place to wear an identity card issued by the local police department. Identity cards could be obtained by filling out an affidavit providing identification and address information about the applicant and further affirming that the applicant was not soliciting for personal use and belonged to a recognized charitable organization. George, a member of Airbreathers Against Tobacco (AAT), wishes to solicit contributions by similarly minded persons for use in his organization's campaign against public smoking. He does not want to comply with the identity card ordinance. He comes to you for legal advice and asks the advisability of challenging the ordinance in federal court. You should inform George that the ordinance is probably: A. Unconstitutional, because it violates the First Amendment's prohibition of government infringement of the right of free speech. B. Unconstitutional, because it prevents religious organizations from obtaining contributions from their members, and thus interferes with the free exercise of religion. C. Constitutional, because it represents a reasonable balancing of the state's police power interest in protecting its citizens from fraud and annoyance against the right of people to seek charitable contributions. D. Constitutional, because preventing fraud in the solicitation for charitable contributions is a compelling interest.

Oscar conveyed Birchacre, located in State Green, to Allen, who had had a judgment lien recorded against him two years earlier in the county in which Birchacre was located. One year later, Allen conveyed the property to Brenda by general warranty deed. The deed did not mention the lien, but Brenda was aware of it. Two years later, Brenda conveyed Birchacre to Carla by special warranty deed. Carla was not aware of the lien and her deed also made no mention of it. One year after that transaction, Carla conveyed Birchacre to Dave by general warranty deed. Dave's deed did not mention the lien but Dave was aware of it. The next year, Dave entered into a contract to convey Birchacre to Edgar. Edgar's title search disclosed the judgment lien against Allen, and Edgar refused to proceed with the transaction because title was not marketable. Dave brought an action against Edgar for specific performance and was denied relief. He then brought an action against Allen, Brenda, and Carla for breach of warranty. Assume for purposes of this question that all transactions concerning Birchacre were promptly and properly recorded, and that the party holding the judgment lien has taken no action as of yet to enforce it. Which parties, if any, will be liable to Dave? A. No one, because Dave had actual knowledge of the lien when he purchased Birchacre. B. Carla only, because the party holding the judgment lien has taken no action as of yet to enforce it. C. Carla and Allen, because Brenda conveyed by special warranty deed. D. Brenda and Allen, because they were aware of the judgment lien but did not mention it in their deeds, but not Carla, because she was not aware of the lien.

When Olivia had received her acceptance letter from the school, she splurged and purchased a new Scandervan 2001 sewing machine for 1,000 so that she would be more than adequately equipped for her design assignments. One day when Olivia was at class, Scarlet loaned Olivia's sewing machine to Violet, whose own machine lacked the fancy options of the Scandervan 2001. Scarlet had loaned Olivia's Scandervan 2001 to other design students on several prior occasions. Unfortunately, Violet, who was not familiar with the delicate Scandervan 2001, caused extensive damage to the machine when she tried to create a cutting edge design by sewing silverware on a dress. It would cost 400 to repair the sewing machine. If Olivia sues Scarlet for the damage Violet caused to the sewing machine, what will be the result? A. Olivia will recover 1,000. B. Olivia will recover the fair market value of the sewing machine. C. Olivia will recover 400. D. Olivia will recover nothing, because Scarlet did not damage the machine and Violet's conduct was not intentional.

He built a manufacturing plant unlike any other in the world capable of producing this liquid. A byproduct of the production of the liquid was a hazardous chemical that was not biodegradable in the environment. Astro buried the waste chemical in a depression on his land. Before doing so, Astro secured expert opinion, based on soil analysis, that led him reasonably to believe that the earth beneath the disposal site was impermeable, and that there was no danger of contaminating the underground waters. The chemical, nonetheless, seeped through the underlying soil strata, and was carried by the flow of percolating water to a well used by Herder to water his sheep, which he raised on an adjacent property. The chemical rendered the water in the well unfit for consumption by sheep. If Herder's sheep were harmed by drinking from the contaminated well, and Herder asserts a claim against Astro for damages to the sheep, which of the following facts, if established, would best aid Astro's case? Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. A. Many companies converted their power plants so that they could utilize the synthetic liquid developed by Astro. B. Herder did not do what a reasonable person would have done to prevent harm to his sheep after he learned that the well was contaminated. C. If he had exercised ordinary care, Herder would have discovered the contamination before his sheep were harmed. D. Astro's plant was in place and in operation before Herder purchased his property.

A new religion sprang up called the Church of the Sunrise. It espoused a number of nontraditional views, among which was the belief that the sun is really a temple that is moved across the sky by a powerful race of aliens. When the Church gained enough members to open a meeting place, it advertised for clerical and maintenance workers. Patricia applied for a position and was told that she would be hired if she converted to the Church of the Sunrise religion. Patricia refused to do so and complained to the state of Lemon human relations board. After investigating, the board concluded that the Church was not an established religion and its beliefs were not plausible. It ruled that the religious exemption would not be applicable and ordered the Church to hire Patricia. Church officials filed an action in federal district court challenging the board's refusal to apply the exemption. How is the court likely to rule? A. The board may not refuse to apply the exemption unless it can prove scientifically that the Church's beliefs are false. B. The board may not refuse to apply the exemption because it does not have compelling grounds for favoring other religions over this one. C. The entire exemption scheme is unconstitutional because it does not have a secular purpose and has a primary effect of advancing religion. D. The board may refuse to apply the exemption because the state has the power to deny any religion the right to discriminate in its hiring.

He heard noises from the bedroom and, upon investigation, Howard was shocked to find his wife, Chastity, in bed with Nick, a good friend of Howard, who lived four blocks away. Nick dressed quickly and took off out the back door. Howard screamed a number of epithets at Chastity and then told her, Nick's going to pay for this! Get me a drink! It will give me the steadiness to do what I have to do to avenge my honor. A frightened Chastity brought Howard a bourbon and water. Howard drank it quickly and demanded yet another drink. After consuming several more drinks, Howard unlocked the closet, pulled out a rifle, and loaded it. He then set off for Nick's house. Howard arrived at Nick's about 10 minutes later. Nick had neglected to lock his front door, so Howard walked in. He found a trembling Nick in the living room, and Howard pointed the gun at him. Nick immediately began apologizing, blaming the affair on Chastity, and pleading for his life. Howard stood silently listening to Nick, but he kept the gun trained on his erstwhile friend. Suddenly, Nick pulled a switchblade knife from his pocket. As the metal flashed, Howard fired a single shot at Nick. The bullet struck him in the middle of the forehead and Nick died instantly. Howard set the gun down, fell to his knees, and began crying. A neighbor who heard the shot reported it to the police. They arrived a few minutes later and found a distraught Howard muttering about losing a friend and a marriage in one night. Howard can be convicted of: A. Murder. B. Manslaughter, because Howard was still distraught over finding Nick in bed with Chastity. C. Manslaughter, because his intoxication prevented Howard from having the requisite intent for murder. D.

The car, driven by Doofus, was pulled over to the curb. As Officer Smith issued a speeding citation to Doofus, her partner, Jones, fed the license plate numbers into the police computer. It turned out that the Belchfire had been very recently reported as stolen. Doofus was unable to produce satisfactory registration papers and was arrested for car theft. At the police station, Smith gave Doofus the standard Miranda warnings, and Doofus agreed to answer Smith's questions regarding a local chopshop network, which arranged for the theft of expensive automobiles so that they could be cut up for parts. After a while, Jones suggested, Let's break for lunch. He and Smith escorted Doofus to a nearby cafeteria. During the course of their lunch, which lasted about an hour, Smith noticed that Doofus, who was otherwise rather shabbily dressed, was wearing an obviously expensive Xelor watch. Upon their return to the station, and without giving any new Miranda warnings, Smith resumed interrogation of Doofus. She asked Doofus about a recent home invasion in the swank Notting Hill neighborhood, where a quantity of valuable jewelry, including a Xelor watch, was taken. Doofus thereupon confessed to the home invasion, and was indicted on the home invasion charge, a felony under the jurisdiction's modern criminal code. If Doofus files an appropriate motion to prevent the confession from being admitted at his trial, Doofus will probably: A. Succeed, because the police did not repeat the Miranda warnings before questioning Doofus about another crime. B. Succeed, because the police acted in a custodial setting. C.

The defense elected not to crossexamine Willie. The plaintiff's next witness was Schrinkov, a child psychologist. Schrinkov, who had never met Willie before, was prepared to testify that, based on his observations of Willie on the witness stand, it was highly probable that Willie was telling the truth. Schrinkov was qualified as an expert witness with many years of experience dealing with children. However, the defense objected to any questions regarding the veracity of Willie. Should Schrinkov be allowed to testify about Willie? A. Yes, because parties may put witnesses on the stand to reinforce or challenge the veracity of other witnesses. B.

Carlos told Jones that, three months before, he had been in Karl's apartment and on that occasion had seen what appeared to be some sticks of dynamite. Reasonably believing that Carlos's information established probable cause, Jones prepared an affidavit for a search warrant. After the warrant was issued, Jones and a group of police raided Karl's apartment. No evidence connecting Karl with the bombing was discovered, but in the search of his apartment the police discovered several grams of cocaine. At his trial for possession of narcotics, Karl's motion to suppress the evidence would probably be: A. Denied, because Carlos was a reliable informant and Jones reasonably believed that Carlos's information was accurate and that the warrant was properly issued. B. Granted, because in fact the police did not discover any evidence linking Karl to the bombings and, therefore, the seizure of the cocaine was fruit of the poisonous tree. C. Granted, if the court determines that the information supplied by Carlos to Jones concerned information too remote in time to justify a claim of probable cause at the time Jones requested the search warrant.

On his behalf, Ken's parents filed suit against Filmont and Oakville, on the grounds of negligence in the design of the monkey bars. At the trial, Filmont was granted a directed verdict, because Oakville now owns the park. Ken's parents appealed the granting of the directed verdict as to Filmont. The appellate court will most likely hold that: A. The decision to grant the directed verdict should be upheld, because Filmont was relieved of liability when he dedicated the park to Oakville. B. The decision to grant the directed verdict should be upheld, because Filmont designed and constructed the park in the public interest. C. The decision to grant the directed verdict should be overturned if plaintiffs introduced evidence that Filmont dedicated the park to Oakville in an effort to avoid liability for the park's negligent design.

The referendum included a provision making criminal any importation of specified nuclear materials into the city limits. The law was immediately challenged in federal court by an interstate trucking firm which regularly transported prohibited nuclear materials through West Rabbit's Foot on the highway. The case ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court, which held in a 54 decision that the challenged ordinance was constitutional because the city had a rational basis for concluding that the citizens of West Rabbit's Foot would be safer if the prohibited materials were kept outside of town, and because the ordinance did not unduly burden interstate commerce. Many other towns and cities throughout the nation considered similar enactments after the Supreme Court decision was announced. You are a lobbyist hired by the trucking industry to persuade Congress that a federal statute prohibiting the state regulation of interstate transportation of nuclear materials must immediately be enacted. Congress member Bluster has tentatively agreed to sponsor such legislation, but wants to know whether such a federal statute would pass constitutional muster. You should advise Bluster that the proposed statute would probably be held: A. Unconstitutional, since the Supreme Court has already ruled that local governments may prohibit specified nuclear materials from crossing their borders. B. Unconstitutional, because the disparate treatment of interstate versus intrastate carriers of nuclear materials would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. C. Constitutional, because Congress has plenary power to regulate interstate commerce. D.

After he had completed that task, he left to do another small job in that area, leaving behind a wheelbarrow with a shovel leaning against it. When Shelley noticed that Jack had left the wheelbarrow and shovel in her front yard, she called his office and spoke to his wife. Jack's wife said that he was on another job in the area and must have intended to pick up the wheelbarrow and shovel on his way back. Shelley said that was fine, and left to go to her weekly bridge club meeting. Later that evening, Jack, who had finished the other job, returned to his office without stopping at Shelley's house.

This was reflected in the tough antilitter ordinances that had been passed by the city council. Littering offenses carried fines of up to 500 and were always very strictly enforced. Center Park was located near the downtown business area of Tidytown. Signs at each of the park entrances, and on the many trash barrels situated throughout the park, carried conspicuous warnings against littering. On October 15, a group of students from nearby colleges chose Center Park in Tidytown as the site for their demonstration against the proliferation of weapons in space. Approximately 125 students gathered in the park with placards and banners, and several speakers addressed the group. One of the speakers, Demagoga, during the course of her speech, walked to one of the trash barrels and dumped the contents out on the ground. As she did so, she told her listeners, This is what outer space is starting to look like, cluttered with the trash of nuclear weapons. The meeting broke up 15 minutes later. The students left the park peacefully, but no one bothered to pick up the trash or right the overturned barrel. Demagoga was arrested pursuant to the Tidytown littering ordinance. She was fined 500 after her conviction. If Demagoga seeks to have her conviction set aside on constitutional grounds, she is likely to: A. Lose, because the antilittering ordinance furthers an important governmental interest and is not aimed at communication. B. Lose, because Demagoga was convicted for her conduct rather than for what she said. C. Win, because Demagoga's conduct constituted symbolic speech. D.

On May 1, Ellen handed Calvin a written order for 50,000 worth of his original gowns, to be delivered to Ellen on September 1. Calvin did not sign an acknowledgment of Ellen's order, but in her presence he set aside the originals designated in her order by putting her name on them. To publicize her new line of merchandise, Ellen conducted a large advertising campaign announcing to the Beverly Hills public that she would have a wide selection of Calvin's originals on display on September 1. She also made substantial improvements to the store to display these clothes in lush and expensive settings.

The tone of the letters made it obvious that Hank and Melissa had been having an affair for at least three years. Dorothy became furious, but kept repeating to herself, Don't get mad, get even! She purchased a handgun and waited for the right moment to use it. The moment occurred at a large outdoor barbecue celebrating Melissa's birthday. At the barbecue, Dorothy gave the gun to Melissa's 10yearold nephew, Sammy. She told Sammy, Why don't you go up and point this gun at your Auntie Melissa. When you pull the trigger a sign will come out saying, 'BANG! and Happy Birthday,' just like in the circus. Sammy took the gun, pointed it at Melissa, and pulled the trigger. However, Sammy's aim was faulty, and when the gun discharged the bullet struck Hank, killing him. The police quickly linked Dorothy to the crime. Which of the following best describes the crime or crimes of which Dorothy can be properly convicted? A. Murder of Hank and attempted murder of Melissa. B. Murder of Hank, but not attempted murder of Melissa. C. Attempted murder of Melissa, but not murder of Hank. D. Attempted murder of Melissa or murder of Hank, but not both. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Chaven was arrested in the city of Briggs, which is located in the state of Riverfront. He was charged with possession of illegal narcotics and placed on trial in the municipal court of Briggs. Chaven demanded a jury trial, which was duly granted. After the jury had been sworn, selected, and impaneled, Chaven's attorney, Fenway, filed a motion with the presiding judge praying for a dismissal based on a technical error in the bill of information drawn up by the city prosecutor. No witnesses had yet been sworn at the time Fenway filed the motion. The judge ordered an immediate recess while he considered the motion. Two days later he ruled in favor of defendant Chaven and dismissed the charges against him.

Chaven was ordered to appear in the superior court of the state of Riverfront to answer the charges. Fenway immediately filed a motion on Chaven's behalf asserting that it would be unconstitutional to retry Chaven in the state court. The best argument against granting the motion is which of the following? A. The city of Briggs and the state of Riverfront are separate sovereigns. B. The state charge requires the proving of a fact not required by the municipal charge. C. Chaven's trial in municipal court had not yet reached the stage where jeopardy attaches. D.

After she reached retirement age, Oralee sold the property to Amber, who financed the purchase with a note secured by a 20 year mortgage with Maritime Bank. Amber promptly recorded her deed, and for 20 years Amber promptly made every payment to the bank. During that period of time, Amber financed the purchase of three automobiles with loans from Maritime Bank, and her record of payment was exemplary. Five years after Amber had paid off the mortgage, she revisited the mortgage loan department of Maritime Bank. She told the loan officer that she wanted to borrow 30,000 to help pay for the medical school education of a favorite niece, securing the loan with a mortgage on Blackacre. After confirming Amber's continuing employment status, the bank officer quickly approved the loan based upon Amber's excellent record with the bank. On June 3, Amber executed the note and the mortgage, and the bank gave Amber a certified check for 30,000, which she immediately deposited in her account at National Bank. On June 4, Amber sold Blackacre to Brittany for 150,000. Brittany, a wealthy actress and film director, paid Amber in cash. Brittany knew nothing about the mortgage. On June 5, Brittany recorded her deed to Blackacre. Two hours after Brittany recorded, Amber closed out her account at National Bank, which included the 30,000 from the mortgage. Amber, an only child who had never married, had no favorite niece. By nightfall, Amber was on a flight to Tahiti with the proceeds of the aforementioned transactions, plus 2 million that she had secretly embezzled from her employer. Brittany did have a favorite niece, an aspiring actress named Christie. On the evening of June 8 , which was a Saturday, Brittany presented Christie with a deed to Blackacre as a gift. At 10 a.m. on June 10, Maritime Bank recorded its mortgage. At 2 p.m. on June 10, Christie recorded her deed. After Amber missed her first mortgage payment on July 1, Maritime Bank employees were sent scurrying to the title office. They discovered the deeds to Brittany and Christie, and the facts surrounding Amber's hasty departure soon surfaced. Maritime Bank demanded that Christie satisfy the 30,000 mortgage. Brittany provided Christie with an attorney, who filed an appropriate suit to determine the various interests in Blackacre. The recording statute in the jurisdiction reads, in relevant part: A conveyance of an estate in land shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, unless the conveyance is recorded. The court should rule that: A. Christie owns Blackacre subject to Maritime Bank's mortgage, because Christie is a donee. B. Christie owns Blackacre subject to Maritime Bank's mortgage, because Maritime Bank recorded before Christie. C. Christie owns Blackacre free of Maritime Bank's mortgage, because Brittany was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. D. Christie owns Blackacre free of Maritime Bank's mortgage, because the bank does not qualify as a bona fide purchaser for value.

Billy Bob took a breathalyzer test that indicated a .12 blood alcohol level, and so Billy Bob was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. At trial, at the close of all the evidence, and over Billy Bob's objection, the judge instructed the jury: If you are convinced that, at the time Billy Bob was pulled over, his blood alcohol level was 10 or greater, you must presume that he was intoxicated. Billy Bob was convicted, and he is appealing on the ground that the judge's instruction was improper. The appellate court should: A. Affirm, because the judge may instruct the jury on the law, and he merely cited the state statute. B.

Under an aidtoeducation statute passed by the state legislature a few years ago, The Classical School and certain other private schools receive state benefits. Among those received by The Classical School are: (i) free textbooks from the state, (ii) an exemption from state taxes, and (iii) 20 % of its operating budget in the form of state grants. The remaining 80 % of The Classical School's budget is covered by tuition fees and by donations from alumni and others. The Classical School is licensed by the state, but the state has no requirement for certification and licensure of teachers in private schools. Timon was hired to teach history at The Classical School and was given the standard threeyear contract given to teachers in their first stint at the school. Timon, who had been a student activist in college, was annoyed every day when he faced classes wearing the uniform required by The Classical School. Timon kept his mouth shut until he was chosen, in the fall term of his second year, to give the monthly History Enrichment Lecture to the entire school. The topic of Timon's lecture was Europe between the two world wars. Timon's lecture was factual, balanced, and nonopinionated, until, at the end of his lecture, he told the assembled students, We've talked a lot this afternoon about the rise of fascism, but think about this: there is absolutely no qualitative difference between those uniforms you're wearing and those worn by the Hitler Youth. If you had any gumption you'd organize a protest against having to wear them. After the speech, Timon was called to the administrative office by the headmaster and fired on the spot, despite Timon's protests that he had almost two years left on his contract. Timon requested a hearing and was curtly told to leave the premises of the school immediately. Charging that his constitutional rights had been violated, Timon filed suit in federal district court. Timon will: A. Succeed, because the school's action violated Timon's freedom of speech rights. B. Succeed, because Timon has been denied due process of law. C.

After extensive public hearings it was clear that the bill had strong support in both houses of the state legislature and that, if called to a vote, the bill would pass easily. Governor Luddite had also made a major speech announcing that he would sign such a bill. However, a few members of the legislature raised questions as to the bill's constitutionality. The constitution of State Green provides that the state supreme court may hand down declaratory judgments, and the question of the bill's constitutionality was brought before the state supreme court. The court ruled that the bill, in the form it was introduced into the legislature, is constitutional. There is only one plutonium processing plant in State Green. It is owned and operated by Master Minerals Corporation. The plant operates under contract with the federal government and is highly profitable for Master Minerals. Master Minerals seeks to have the judgment of the state supreme court overturned, and its attorneys have filed appropriate papers to bring the case before the United States Supreme Court. The Court should: A. Not hear the matter, because no case or controversy exists. B. Review the state court's opinion and reverse it. C. Review the state court's opinion and affirm it. D.

However, a worldwide drop in the price of petroleum was severe enough to cause a depression in Petrolia, and the state's unemployment rate soared. To counter the effect the depression was having on Petrolia's citizens, the state legislature passed a law requiring all employers operating in the state's oil and natural gas fields to give preference in hiring to residents of Petrolia. The bill banned the hiring of nonresidents unless no other qualified person could be found to fill an oilfield or natural gas field position. Under prevailing economic conditions, the statute was tantamount to a total ban on hiring of nonresidents because so many unemployed oil and gas workers had been created by the depression and little new exploration was taking place. Roughnecks, as oilfield workers call themselves, tend to be an itinerant lot, moving from place to place as new fields are brought into production. Driller was a 48yearold roughneck whose permanent residence was in Louisiana. He had worked on offshore rigs in the Gulf waters off his home state, but Driller had also worked in Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, Kuwait, Indonesia, and Venezuela. Upon hearing that one of the few independent companies actively exploring in Petrolia had struck a new field in that state, Driller drove to the field office of Ewing Exploration Company in Petrolia and applied for a job. Looking at Driller's extensive experience as described on Driller's resume, Ewing's personnel officer sadly shook his head. He indicated that Driller's qualifications were better than anyone's working in the field, but that he had more applications from experienced Petrolia residents than he had jobs to offer. The sole reason given for not hiring Driller was the preferential hiring statute favoring state residents. Driller filed suit in federal district court challenging the statute. The court should rule in favor of: A. Petrolia, because employment discrimination is only unconstitutional if it involves race, religion, alienage, or sex. B. Petrolia, because the state's interest in hiring local residents outweighs the interest of nonresidents. C. Driller, because the law denies him the privileges and immunities of state citizenship. D. Driller, because the preferential hiring law impairs Driller's rights under the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution.

Seeing no other way out, he decided to sell Cattlefork, a distant ranch that had been in his family for generations, to his childhood nemesis, Astro. Not wanting to lose control of the family property forever, Oiler inserted a provision in the deed to Astro binding Astro, his heirs, and assigns to offer Oiler, his heirs, and assigns the right of first refusal to purchase Cattlefork when it was offered for sale. Astro was not happy with the provision, but Oiler refused to sell the property without the covenant included. Astro reluctantly agreed. Cattlefork was conveyed to Astro, and the deed containing the right of first refusal was duly recorded. Astro lived on Cattlefork for 23 years. His dislike for Oiler was so great that he did not want Oiler to ever get the property back. Therefore, Astro devised a stratagem to get around the covenant. When informed that Cowboy was interested in buying the property, Astro decided to execute his plan. Astro's friend Ranger agreed to act as a straw man to avoid the consequences of the covenant. Astro deeded Cattlefork as a gift to Ranger. Ranger recorded the deed, which did not contain the right of first refusal covenant, and Ranger then sold the land to Cowboy for 200,000, giving the proceeds of the sale to Astro. Cowboy knew nothing about the right of first refusal because he inspected only Ranger's deed from Astro. When Oiler learned of what had happened, he filed suit to compel conveyance of the land to him. To back up his words, Oiler produced a 200,000 letter of credit. The jurisdiction in which the property is located has an unmodified common law Rule Against Perpetuities and the following recording statute: Any conveyance of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice, whose conveyance is first recorded. How will the court most likely rule in this case? A. Oiler will prevail, because a deed with the covenant granting the right of first refusal was in Cowboy's chain of title. B. Oiler will prevail, because Astro and Ranger acted in bad faith. C. Oiler will not prevail, because the covenant is void under the Rule Against Perpetuities. D. Oiler will not prevail, because the covenant, although enforceable against Astro personally, does not run with the land.

The chute was placed on the market, with the warning, This parachute should be discarded after 150 jumps. Parafun's market researchers had established that the usual practice among sport skydivers was to discard a parachute after 100 jumps. After the design had been approved and the product was successfully manufactured and marketed, Silk took several of the parachutes to an independent stress analysis laboratory. The scientists tested the chutes and concluded that there was a 1 % failure rate on the chutes for jumps 100 through 150 , because the center of the parachute might tend to collapse because of a design defect. Silk did not report this problem to his superiors at Parafun, because he feared he would be fired. Several months after Silk received the testing report, Airborne, a sport skydiver, used one of the chutes designed by Silk and manufactured and sold by Parafun. Airborne's use was the 115 th jump for the chute. When Airborne leaped from the airplane, the chute opened properly, but halfway down, the center of the chute collapsed inward. Airborne hurtled to the ground to his death. An investigation established that Silk knew of the design defect. If Parafun is charged with manslaughter in a common law jurisdiction, the verdict should be: A. Guilty, because Silk was Parafun's employee and he designed the instrumentality of death. B. Guilty, because Airborne died as a result of the failure of a product manufactured and sold by Parafun. C. Not guilty, because a corporation cannot be found guilty of manslaughter. D. Not guilty, because there was only a 1 % chance of parachute failure.

Deborah then told her secretary, Walter, Ned just got hurt because I forgot to do my yard work. On returning home, however, Deborah discovered that Ned had tripped over roots from his own tree in his own yard. Ned disagreed and sued Deborah and her husband. At trial, Ned called Walter to testify as to Deborah's statement to him. Walter's testimony will be: A. Excluded, because Deborah had no firsthand information when she made her statement to Walter.

She noticed at the time that the green car, which was driven by Def, did not come to a complete stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection to strike the yellow car driven by Plee after Plee's car had already entered the intersection. Plee sued Def for damages and injuries, but the trial did not take place until almost three years after the accident. Plee wanted Harriet to testify on his behalf against Def, but Harriet's recollection of the accident was very fuzzy. The night before she was scheduled to testify, Harriet consulted her diary, in which Harriet had noted that Def's car ran the stop sign and entered the intersection after Plee's car was already in the intersection. Plee's attorney called Harriet to the stand, and she testified regarding Def's failure to observe the stop sign and Def's entrance into the intersection after Plee. On crossexamination, Def's attorney asked Harriet if she had consulted any materials to prepare for her testimony. Harriet admitted that her recollection of the accident had been fuzzy and that she had consulted her diary the night before her testimony. Def's attorney immediately moved that Harriet's testimony be stricken from the record. The court should rule that: A. Harriet's testimony is admissible if, after reviewing her notes, she had an independent recollection of the event. B. Harriet's testimony is admissible, because the contents of her diary are protected under the work product rule. C. Harriet's testimony should be stricken, because her diary was not made available to the opposing party prior to trial. D. Harriet's testimony should be stricken, because it is not the best evidence.

A portion of the funds that were used were received from the federal government as part of a federal revenue sharing plan. Moss was charged with a violation of federal law when he and his committee made a 10,000 grant for textbooks to a private school for whites only. Moss's defense is that his action as chairman of this committee was in the course of his legislative duties, and thus, immune from federal interference. The best argument that would support Moss's constitutional claim is: A. If the state law authorizes Moss's action, he cannot be prosecuted for violation of a federal law. B. The Tenth Amendment forbids the federal government from restricting the state's rights regarding the education of minor children within the state. C. The doctrine of federalism prevents the federal government from interfering with a member of the state's legislature in the performance of his legislative duties. D.

The Act requires complainants to bring charges before the Alpine Fair Employment Commission within 180 days of the occurrence of alleged unlawful employment practices. The Commission then has 120 days to convene a factfinding conference to obtain evidence, ascertain the parties' positions, and explore settlement possibilities. Larson was discharged from his job with Widget Corp. purportedly because of a physical handicap unrelated to his ability to perform his job. Larson filed a timely complaint, alleging unlawful termination of employment, as required by the statute. However, through inadvertence, the Commission scheduled the factfinding conference for a date five days after expiration of the 120 day statutory period. At the conference, Widget moved that the charge be dismissed for lack of a timely conference. The Commission denied the motion. Widget petitioned the Alpine Supreme Court. The court held for Widget, stating that the failure to comply with the 120 day requirement deprived the Commission of jurisdiction to consider Larson's charge. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, Larson argues that his right to due process will be violated if the Commission's error is allowed to extinguish his cause of action. Which of the following best describes the viability of Larson's due process claim? A. The claim fails, because Larson had no protected property interest in his job. B. The claim fails, because the Alpine legislature, having conferred on claimants a remedy for claims of unfair employment practices, has the prerogative to establish limiting procedures for such claims. C. The claim succeeds, because Larson had a protected property interest in the remedy. D. The claim succeeds, because of the fundamental unfairness of leaving Larson without a remedy.

There was some difference in the design of the tires, and a number of tire manufacturers made both types of tires, which were deemed to be equally safe by independent testing labs. Most state statutes and vehicle regulations allowed the use of both types of tires on state highways. However, State Plum and State Apricot had laws on their books permitting only Grippers and banning Grabbers. State Grapefruit, on the other hand, had a statute allowing the use of Grabbers, and banning Grippers, on its state highways. The National Trucking Board, a trade association of interstate trucking firms, brought suit to have the laws of State Plum and State Apricot declared unconstitutional. The case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which struck down the Apricot and Plum statutes as undue burdens on interstate commerce. The National Trucking Board then brought suit in federal court to have the State Grapefruit statute banning Grippers struck down. The Grapefruit attorney general argued that the Grapefruit statute did not burden interstate commerce because Grabbers were now legal in all 50 states. The case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court. How should the Court rule on the constitutionality of the statute? A. Constitutional, because there is no difference in safety between Grippers and Grabbers. B. Constitutional, because the states have the power to regulate safety on their highways. C. Unconstitutional, because it is an undue burden on interstate commerce. D. Unconstitutional, because it violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

The lease was in writing and Theresa agreed to pay Michael an annual rent, which she always did promptly. Theresa had been leasing Blackacre from Michael for 15 years, when Seymour took a trip to State Black and decided to take a look at Blackacre. Upon discovering Theresa's occupancy, Seymour filed suit to quiet title, joining Michael in the action. In State Black, the statute of limitations for bringing an ejectment action for trespass to real property is set at 10 years. Whom shall the court declare to be the owner of Blackacre? A. Seymour, because a lease to a third party does not constitute occupancy by Michael. B. Seymour, because he was unaware that another was occupying Blackacre. C.

However, the State Yellow legislature decided it was time to take steps against all forms of drug abuse and passed the Omnibus AntiDrug Act (OADA). One of the OADA provisions forbade the selling of airplane glue to anyone under the age of 18 except in small quantities in prepackaged model kits. Violation of the statute was penalized by fines or, in cases of multiple violations, possible imprisonment. OADA also required that all elementary and secondary schools licensed by the state provide comprehensive drug education programs. Primrose was a 14yearold resident of State Yellow. Primrose had experienced the drug education program in his school, as mandated by OADA. One of the units in the program covered the dangers of glue sniffing. Primrose understood the antidrug instruction, but he enjoyed the high he got from sniffing glue when he constructed model airplanes, and he wanted to experience more of it. He went to Daffodil's Hobby & Craft Shop to purchase a large tube of airplane glue. Daffodil, sole proprietor of the hobby shop, sold the large tube of glue to Primrose. Primrose went home, hid in the garage, and sniffed the glue. His parents found Primrose in a coma on the garage floor. Although Primrose will survive, physicians have told his parents that he suffered permanent brain damage from sniffing the glue. On Primrose's behalf, the parents filed suit against Daffodil, which should result in a verdict: A. For Daffodil, because Primrose was aware of the danger when he sniffed the glue. B. For Daffodil, because Primrose is not a member of the class of persons meant to be protected by OADA. C. For Primrose, because Daffodil violated OADA when he sold the glue to Primrose. D.

On Myrtle's property there is a natural freshwater spring. Cyrus asked Myrtle if it would be possible to build an irrigation ditch from the spring to his property in order to provide water for his cattle. Since the spring supplied more than enough water to meet Myrtle's needs, she agreed, provided that Cyrus construct the ditch in such a manner that it would need the least maintenance possible, because Myrtle did not wish to be continually bothered by Cyrus's coming on her land. Cyrus constructed a concrete irrigation ditch from the spring to the land. The cost of construction of the ditch was 25,000. The only maintenance required on the ditch was a semiannual cleaning. Three years later, Myrtle informed Cyrus that her water needs had increased and that she could no longer allow Cyrus to take water from the spring. In addition, Myrtle did not allow Cyrus on her land to do the semiannual cleaning, resulting in the blocking of the ditch. Cyrus wishes to keep water flowing through the irrigation ditch to his land.

The agreement went on to state that GM would pay 150 for each 10 loaf container of pates ordered from FGF. The agreement between GM and FGF also contained the statement, either party may cancel this contract after two months upon giving reasonable notice to the other party. Assume that, after FGF faithfully filled GM's orders for six months, FGF determined that it was becoming too costly to operate the special oven used to roast the pate loaves. The oven had been manufactured in Belgium in 1937, but the plant that manufactured the oven was destroyed by bombing during World War II, and no more of the ovens were produced after 1940 . It would be difficult and expensive to find a suitable substitute, and when the oven malfunctioned, replacement parts were extremely difficult to find and very costly as well. FGF, therefore, decided to get out of the pate business entirely and to use its supply of goose livers to make a Germanstyle liver sausage. FGF notified GM of its decision and the reasons for it, and shortly thereafter stopped shipping pate to GM. GM sued FGF, demanding that FGF continue to ship pate to GM or pay monetary damages to GM. Will GM prevail? A. Yes, because it was not impossible for FGF to perform. B. Yes, because FGF assumed the risk that making pate would become expensive. C. No, because the expense of fixing the oven provides a good faith reason for stopping production. D. No, because the cancellation provision made the contract illusory.

Acting on the tip, Augustus purchased several acres of scrubcovered land of little apparent value. Shortly thereafter, Whizny World, an international conglomerate, announced plans to develop a theme park to be called Romeland on a tract immediately adjacent to Augustus's scrubland. The Whizny World plan caused real estate values in the surrounding area to skyrocket. Augustus could have sold his land for a price many times greater than the purchase price, but Augustus decided that he would use the land to build a variety of touristoriented facilities. In order to finance his project, Augustus went to Brutus Bank (Brubank) and took out a 20,000 mortgage on his land. Brubank promptly recorded the mortgage. A few days later, Augustus went to Cassius Bank (Casbank) and took out a 15,000 mortgage on the land. Casbank had known of the Brubank mortgage, and Casbank promptly recorded its own mortgage. A few weeks after that, Augustus reviewed his plans and decided that he needed more money to make his proposed tourist facilities more upscale. Augustus went back to Brubank and, after full disclosure of the Casbank mortgage, asked the loan officer if he could receive another advance of 15,000 from the original Brubank mortgage. The loan officer readily agreed, processed the loan, and increased the amount borrowed against the mortgage from 20,000 to 35,000. Brubank promptly recorded the change. Augustus quickly spent most of his available funds on retainers for architects, builders, and attorneys. He was shocked to read in the paper that the County Council summarily rejected the Whizny World proposal, acceding to the arguments of community activists and environmentalists that the economic benefits from the theme park would be outweighed by the deleterious effects on the natural beauty and tranquility of the area. Augustus made no more mortgage payments to Casbank, but continued to make payments to Brubank. The value of the land plummeted, and Casbank brought a foreclosure action against Augustus and included Brubank as a party. At the foreclosure sale, the proceeds were a mere 18,000 after attorneys' fees and court costs. How should the proceeds be divided? A. 18,000 to Brubank and nothing to Casbank.

Thus, the Council decided to use 1.5 million for housing and to borrow the remaining 1 million from the housing fund to build a commercial mall. The city resolution provided that 30 % of the rental from the mall each year would go to a fund for maintenance of the housing and for funds to build additional housing. Construction had started on two highrise residential buildings and the commercial mall when the federal court, at the request of the federal government, froze the construction accounts containing the proceeds from the grant. In a motion by the city to release the funds, the court would most likely: A. Grant the motion, because the city's plan for a fund to build more residential housing substantially complies with the terms of the grant. B. Grant the motion, because the doctrine of preservation of state sovereignty prevents the federal government from interfering with the state's discretion in this situation. C. Deny the motion, because the federal government can control the expenditure of the funds since it provided the funds. D. Deny the motion, since the doctrine of state sovereignty has no application in this situation since the action was by the city council and not the state legislature. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"C"},{"prompt":"Opal owned a large tract of land in fee simple and subdivided 100 acres into 250 lots. She obtained all the necessary governmental approvals, and between 1991 and 2003 sold 175 of the lots. Preston, who purchased one of the lots to build a house, received a deed containing the following provision, which was in all the deeds to these 175 lots: It is agreed and covenanted by Opal that the property conveyed herein shall be used for a singlefamily dwelling only and that no structure, other than a singlefamily dwelling, shall be erected or maintained; further, that occupancy in any dwelling built on this property shall be by a single family for residential purposes only. This agreement is specifically made binding on the grantee and grantee's heirs, their assigns and successors. In 2004, Opal contracted with Fun Spa to sell an additional 100 acres that she owned contiguous to these lots. As part of this agreement, Opal conveyed to Fun Spa the 75 lots she had not previously sold. Nothing in the deeds for these 75 lots restricted their use to singlefamily residences, and in fact, Fun Spa was planning to use all the property purchased from Opal for a resort and for multifamily dwellings. If Preston brought suit against Opal to establish that all the original 250 lots, including the 75 she had agreed to sell to Fun Spa, had to be used only for singlefamily dwellings in a proper proceeding, what would be the most likely result? A. Opal will prevail, because the provision in the deed only binds the grantee. B. Opal will prevail, because the remaining 75 deeds did not contain this provision. C. Preston will prevail, if he can show that a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision. D. Preston will prevail, unless the evidence shows that Fun Spa was not aware of this provision at the time of its agreement with Opal.

She saw a car speeding off into the distance and found a badly injured Victor lying in the street. Victor gasped to Moms, I'm going to die. The car that hit me had license number DD666! Victor then lapsed into unconsciousness. Moms gave her information to the police, including a description of the car and Victor's comment on the license plate. Police traced the registration to Dick Devilish. Victor recovered from his injuries but now suffers permanent disabilities. Victor filed suit against Devilish for his injuries. At the trial, Victor wants to have Moms testify as to Victor's statement regarding Devilish's license number. The court should rule that such testimony by Moms is: A. Inadmissible, because it is more prejudicial than probative. B. Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. C. Admissible, as a declaration made in belief of impending death. D. Admissible, as an excited utterance.

On March 15, Quinn purchased the office building and told Stone that he wanted to negotiate a new lease. During the negotiations, Stone and Quinn orally agreed that Stone would have the exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. Quinn prepared a written lease outlining the StoneQuinn agreement, but forgot to include the agreement that Stone would have exclusive rights in the office building. Stone was given a copy of the lease to read, but Stone merely glanced over the lease because he assumed it reflected his agreement with Quinn. Stone then signed the lease, which included a merger and integration clause. On March 30, Quinn leased space to Jacobs for the establishment of a drug store to be run by Jacobs. The QuinnJacobs lease did not prevent Jacobs from selling newspapers or magazines. As a result of the competition, Stone lost substantial profits in his business. Stone brings suit to reform the contract to reflect his exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. The most likely result of this suit is that: A. Stone will prevail. B. Stone will prevail only if he can prove a mutual mistake. C. Stone will not prevail because of the application of the parol evidence rule. D. Stone will not prevail because the mistake on his part was unilateral.

Later that summer, Walter was using his boat on the lake to tow some of his friends while they waterskied when he found himself near the end of the lake where the large dam that had formed the lake was located. Several hundred feet from the dam were large pylons bearing signs warning boaters to stay at least 50 yards away. Between the pylons and the dam, about 100 feet from the pylons, was a partially submerged chain link fence covering the underwater pipes that drew water to run the hydroelectric generating turbines. Walter decided to show off by weaving his boat in and out of the warning pylons. As he rounded the last of them, the steering mechanism of his boat jammed, and it and Walter were propelled into the chain link fence. Tom, who was skiing behind the boat, was pulled into one of the pylons. Both Walter and Tom were severely injured. The jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. If Tom brings a negligence action against Watersports, Inc., and it is found that the steering failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the boat, will he recover for his injuries? A. No, because he did not purchase the boat. B. No, if Walter is found to have been negligent in weaving in and out of the pylons. C. Yes, if the defect in the steering mechanism could have been discovered by Watersports, Inc. in the exercise of reasonable care. D.

The victims were given bonus payments, after they had made a large initial investment, for additional distributors who they would bring to the manufacturer. Cheryl's defense is that she knew nothing of the scheme. She claims she was brought into the scheme by the purported head of the manufacturer's sales department and was just following instructions to bring additional distributors into the sales force. The prosecution intends to call Darryl, who will testify that Cheryl had talked him into making an investment in a similar scheme involving household products, rather than cosmetics, five years ago. Should the trial court admit this evidence over Cheryl's objection? A. No, because evidence of other acts or wrongs is not admissible to prove character and action in conformity therewith. B. No, because it is irrelevant. C. Yes, because it is evidence of Cheryl's character for dishonesty. D. Yes, because it is evidence of Cheryl's state of mind.

Betty and her teenage son, Norm, planned to live in the house for this period. Norm was a star baseball player for the local high school team. To provide Norm with an adequate place to practice, Betty installed a fully operational batting cage in the backyard located on Red Acre. In addition to the batting cage, Betty installed an automatic pitching machine and electric lights so that Norm could practice at night. Six months after Alice leased the premises to Betty, Alice mortgaged Red Acre to State Bank to secure a loan. Betty was not notified directly of the mortgage but the mortgage was recorded. Six months before the threeyear term was to end, Alice defaulted on her mortgage payments, and State Bank began foreclosure proceedings, as it was entitled to do on the terms of the mortgage. Although unaware of the mortgage proceedings, Betty knew that her lease with Alice was about to end; she therefore began to remove all of the equipment she had installed in the backyard. State Bank brought an action to enjoin the removal of the equipment, naming both Betty and Alice as defendants in the suit. If the equipment concerned had been installed by Alice, but the facts were otherwise unchanged, the effect of the State Bank's prayer for an injunction would be that the: A. Likelihood of the State Bank's succeeding would be lessened. B. Likelihood of the State Bank's succeeding would be improved. C. Likelihood of the State Bank's succeeding would be unaffected. D. Outcome of the litigation would depend on whether the mortgage expressly mentioned personal property located on the premises.

Jenny was emotionally disturbed and of borderline mental retardation, but understood that the police were after Joey, and because she hated the police, she told Joey she would do anything she could to help him. To avoid the police, they drove to the mountains with Jenny doing much of the driving. The following day, they were both very hungry. Toward evening, Joey saw Fisher camped by a stream nearby, and told Jenny, Go down there and steal some food from his ice chest; he'll never even see you, but if he does, hit him with something heavy. When she hesitated, Joey became angry and said, Go on, or I'll just leave you here to starve! Jenny went down to Fisher's campsite, and had just grabbed a sandwich out of his ice chest and taken a bite out of it, when Fisher, who was 6'6 tall and weighed 250 pounds, ran back from the stream and grabbed her arm. Jenny was terrified and picked up a heavy frying pan and hit Fisher on the head; he slumped to the ground apparently dead. Joey then ran up and said, He's dead. We'd better put him in the stream so it will look like he drowned after slipping and falling. They thereupon put Fisher in the stream without attempting to determine if he was alive or dead. Later, a medical examination showed conclusively that the blow only knocked Fisher out; he died of suffocation due to water in the lungs. If Jenny is charged with petit theft of Fisher's food, a misdemeanor, the court should rule that: A. Jenny is not guilty because she was acting under the direction of Joey. B. Jenny is guilty because an otherwise criminal act cannot be justified by threats of starvation. C. Jenny is not guilty because there was no carrying away of Fisher's food, and hence no completed theft crime was committed. D. Jenny is not guilty if a reasonable person would have regarded the theft as essential to avoid starvation.

As he started to stuff silverware into a sack, he was surprised by Vera, who had arrived home earlier than usual. Dirk struck Vera on the head with a candlestick and tied her up. He finished filling his sack and left. The police discovered Vera several hours later and rushed her to the hospital. Dirk was apprehended by the police early the following morning with the loot still in his possession. He was taken to police headquarters, given Miranda warnings, and asked if he wished to make a statement about the prior evening's events. The police did not mention that Vera had been seriously injured and was in the hospital. Dirk said he understood his rights and was willing to talk. He then admitted that he committed the burglary of Vera's house. The following day, Vera died from injuries caused by the blow to her head. If, at Dirk's trial for murder, Dirk moves to prevent introduction of the confession into evidence, his motion should most probably be: A. Denied, because failure of the police to advise Dirk of Vera's condition was harmless error since felony murder does not require intent to kill or injure. B. Denied, because Dirk's waiver of his rights did not depend upon the nature of the charges that were later filed against him. C. Granted, because Dirk could not make a knowing and intelligent waiver unless he had information concerning Vera's condition. D. Granted, because the use of a confession to burglary in a prosecution for murder violates due process where the police withheld information about the potential seriousness of the offense.

Boyd's examination of the record prior to the date of closing had disclosed, however, that the owner of record was not Simmons, but Olson.

Soon the woman, whose name was Stephanie, was visiting the center regularly to play chess with Asa. They became close friends and often visited each other's homes. Asa decided that he would like Stephanie to have his only real asset, Oldacre, the singlefamily residence in which he lived. He wrote a note to Stephanie dated December 25, 2003, stating, Because you have been such a good friend to a lonely old man, I want you to have this house and land.'

After Parker had spent two nights at Hotel, he received a call at 5 a.m. from his wife, who told him that their child had just been rushed to the hospital and was in critical condition. Parker decided to hurry home. He called the airport and reserved space on the next flight out, scheduled to leave at 6: 15 a.m. Parker packed and rushed to the lobby. However, it happened that a number of guests were checking out early that morning, and thus there was a long line ahead of him and only one cashier on duty. Parker hoped that the line would move quickly, but when he heard the first guest in line arguing with Stockton, the desk clerk, over a 25 / otin telephone charge, he realized that he would never make it to the airport in time if he continued to wait in line. The hotel had no express checkout service available, so he left without paying his bill and flew home. As soon as Parker's child was out of danger, he wrote a letter to Hotel, apologizing for his swift departure and enclosing payment for two nights' lodging; he also added an extra 25 to cover any inconvenience and billing expense he may have caused. Meanwhile, Stockton discovered that Parker had left without paying. On Hotel's behalf, Stockton signed a complaint with the state police, charging Parker with theft of services. The police went to the appropriate magistrate, and a warrant was sworn out for Parker's arrest. The day after Parker left Hotel, Hotel received Parker's letter and payment. However, no one notified the police that Parker had paid his bill. Three days after Parker left Hotel, the state police, armed with a warrant, came to Parker's office and arrested him. Despite Parker's objections, he was taken to jail. Although he repeatedly told the police that he had paid his bill and suggested that they call Hotel, they refused to do so.

Western States Freight, a trucking firm that frequently uses Nevada highways for trips between Colorado and California, has recently purchased several tractortrailer rigs weighing over 100,000 pounds when loaded. Most of its equipment may still be legally used in Nevada, but the firm does not want to have to exclude the superheavies from the California runs and plans to gradually replace its older trucks with larger models. Western brings an action for declaratory relief in federal court in Colorado, seeking to have the Nevada legislation declared unconstitutional. The state of Nevada asserts that the legislation is justified as an exercise of the state's police power based upon safety considerations, and that the court may not secondguess the state legislators as to this subject. None of the evidence presented at the legislative hearings is produced in court. Western presents expert testimony that the heavier trucks are no less safe than smaller models. The trial court should rule: A. That the legislation is an unconstitutional violation of Western's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process of law. B.

The agreement provided that escrow would close on March 31, and on that date Lynn would provide good and marketable title to the house, free and clear of all encumbrances. On March 10, Lynn was notified by her insurance company that she had to renew her insurance policy by March 15 . Lynn immediately notified the company that she did not want the insurance renewed at that time. Consequently, when the house was destroyed by fire on March 25, it was uninsured. On March 31, Werner refused to close and Lynn immediately brought an action against him for specific performance. In this jurisdiction, which has no applicable statute to govern this situation, the most probable result of this action would be: A. Werner prevails, because an implied term of all conveyances is that the property at the time of closing will be in substantially the same condition as it was at the time the contract was entered into. B. Werner prevails, because as the house was destroyed, Lynn would have nothing to sell and, therefore, could not convey marketable title. C. Lynn prevails, because under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss was on Werner. D. Lynn prevails, but since the house was destroyed, she is only entitled to recover the fair market value of the land itself.

The New Lancashire police decided to create a new undercover position for the person who would infiltrate the ACM. The pay was substantially better than the salary of ordinary officers. Dimer, the chief personnel officer of the New Lancashire State Police, put out a memo inviting all white New Lancashire police officers to apply for the undercover position. Pendergrass had been a New Lancashire State Police officer for eight years and had received many citations for efficiency, bravery, and public service. However, Pendergrass is black, and Dimer refused to even accept his application for the undercover position, even though Pendergrass told Dimer that he was very desirous of obtaining the position. If Pendergrass sues to require Dimer to give serious consideration to his application, should the court rule that Dimer has acted in a manner in accordance with the principles of the United States Constitution? A. Yes, because the state has a rational basis for using race as a qualification for the job. B. Yes, because the state has a compelling interest in infiltrating mathrm{ACM}, to promote the general welfare of its citizens. C. No, because Dimer's actions were discriminatory per se. D.

Wes paid 100,000 down and agreed to pay the balance in equal monthly installments over the next 15 years. Jane's eldest son, Luke, started law school in 1999 and, because Jane wanted to help him with his educational and living expenses, she sent a letter to Wes instructing him to send Luke 500 a month from the money he owed to Jane until Jane instructed him otherwise. Wes was unable to raise the capital he needed to expand the hotel, and in 2000 he sold the resort to Funco in exchange for Funco's agreement to assume all his obligations and to provide him with a longterm contract to be the hotel's manager. Funco agreed with these terms and assumed the contract Wes had with Jane. In 2002, when Luke had completed law school, Jane's other son, Zack, was getting married. Jane knew Zack could not afford to buy a house so Jane told Zack that she would instruct Wes and Funco to send the full installments to Zack so he could buy a house if Zack agreed that Jane could have the funds back if she ever needed them. Zack agreed, and Jane wrote a letter to Wes informing him of this agreement and instructing him that the full payment should now go to Zack. Zack was given a copy of this letter. In 2003, Funco wanted to get out of the resort business, and it sold the hotel and all the obligations back to Wes. About this same time, Jane promised her sister's daughter, Susan, that if she wanted to go to Europe for several months to study art, Jane would pay her expenses. Susan agreed, and Jane sent another letter to Wes telling him to send the monthly installments to Susan until Jane told him otherwise. Wes did so. Several months later Jane died, leaving all her cash (and the balance due on the note from Wes) to Zack. If Zack were to sue Funco to recover the sums paid to Susan, how would a court hold? A. Judgment for Zack, because he was a creditor beneficiary, had notice, and had changed his position in reliance on the contract. B. Judgment for Zack, because he was a donee beneficiary and had assented to the agreement. C. Judgment for Funco, because Zack's rights had not vested before being extinguished by the subsequent assignment. D.

In 1959, McWilliams, the owner of Rightacre, purchased Leftacre. She continued to operate both parcels as separate dairy farms. In 1979, McWilliams sold Rightacre to Stone, who promptly and properly recorded the deed. Since Rightacre had no direct access to a public road, McWilliams wrote into the deed, Stone, his heirs and assigns shall have the right to use the existing dirt path along the eastern border of Leftacre for ingress and egress to Rightacre. The dirt path, which connected with a public road on the northern boundary of Leftacre, was wide enough for motored vehicle traffic and had been graded for that purpose. In 1994, Sandberg purchased Leftacre from McWilliams. In 2002, Stone died, leaving a will that devised all his interest in Rightacre to O'Toole. For this question only, assume the following facts: In 2003, O'Toole decided to subdivide Rightacre into several lots for singlefamily residences. O' Toole notified Sandberg that he, O'Toole, will spend the money to improve the dirt path into a private driveway by paving it and doubling its width to 24 feet. He will also provide appropriate drainage for such an improved driveway by means of ditches on either side of the pavement. Sandberg had ceased using Leftacre as a dairy farm five years earlier, and it has been vacant ever since. Sandberg instituted an appropriate action for a declaratory judgment to establish that O'Toole cannot so improve the dirt path. If Sandberg prevails in such an action, it will be because: A. The proposed improvement exceeds the scope of an easement by necessity. B. The proposed improvement constitutes a burden that exceeds the scope of an express easement. C. The servient owner has the obligation for maintenance of an easement for rightofway, and hence can control the nature of its improvement. D. The proposed subdivision so changes the nature of the use of the dominant tenement that any easement has been abandoned.

Pitts fell even though she was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the impact because the seatbelt buckle was also defective and failed to hold Pitts. Assume that a local ordinance requires all automobiles to be equipped with door latches that will not open on impact, and that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. If Pitts asserts a claim against Drago, Pitts will: A. Prevail, unless Stratton was negligent in the manufacture of the car that Pitts was driving. B. Prevail, because Drago's negligent driving was a cause in fact of the collision. C. Not prevail, because the door latch on Pitts's car violated a local ordinance. D.

By mutual agreement, they used the money to purchase a 10 acre parcel of land. Ben and Sandy took title as joint tenants. Three years after the purchase, Ben suggested to Sandy that they build an apartment house on the property. Sandy rejected this idea. Ben then asked if he could build an apartment house on his half of the property; Sandy agreed. Ben then built an apartment house on the eastern five acres of the property. Six months later, Sandy gave permission to the Boy Scouts of America to use the western half of the property as a site for weekend camping trips. Two years later, Ben died, leaving his entire estate to his son, Steven. In an appropriate action to determine the respective interests of Sandy and Steven in the property, if Steven is judged to be the owner of the eastern five acres of the property, the most likely reason for the judgment will be that: A. Sandy's conduct during Ben's lifetime estopped her from asserting title to the eastern half of the property. B. The taking of title as joint tenants does not conclusively presume that the property is held as joint tenants. C. The joint tenancy was terminated by the oral agreement of Ben and Sandy at the time it was made. D.

Bob, another guest, thereupon produced a large skyrocket, which he lit. However, the skyrocket failed to climb properly and crashed into Clem's garage, starting a fire. Clem rushed out of his house and attempted to put out the flames, but he suffered a heart attack and was rendered unconscious. The garage burned to the ground before the fire department arrived. Fortunately, however, the firefighters were able to revive Clem, and he has since recovered from the heart attack. A local ordinance made it a misdemeanor to sell fireworks within the city limits.

(TM), a firm specializing in timeandmotion studies of labor intensive industries. After extensive negotiations, it was orally agreed that TM would redesign the food production area of MacDougall's restaurants, including modification of cooking equipment, if necessary, so that, using existing MacDougall's food products, savings in labor costs through reduction in restaurant cooking staffs would result. Lawyers for MacDougall's subsequently drafted a written agreement, sent it to TM, whose lawyers modified the draft, and returned the modified draft to MacDougall's. This modified writing, signed by both parties, stated in its entirety: Provided that at least 2,000 workhours per restaurant are eliminated, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM within 90 days of installation of new food production systems at MacDougall's restaurants in Richmond a first installment of 1 million. Upon installation of new food processing systems nationwide, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM a second and final installment of 1.5 million. Nationwide installation must be completed by January 15,2005 . Any amendments to this agreement must be in writing signed by both parties. TM immediately began work on the restructuring of MacDougall's food processing methods. On September 5, 2004, a radical change in the layout of MacDougall's kitchen area and new personnel assignments had been designed, and TM demanded payment of the first installment payment of 1 million. MacDougall Corporation refused, but negotiations conducted between the parties resulted in an oral agreement that MacDougall's would pay 750,000 immediately and then the 1.5 million second installment as originally agreed, after nationwide installation of the new system. The restructured food production system was installed and in operation in all Richmond MacDougall's restaurants on October 1, 2004. Subsequent audits revealed that the new system enabled MacDougall Corporation to eliminate 1,500 workhours per restaurant, saving the corporation 90,000 in labor costs for all Richmond restaurants. The new system required that MacDougall's increase the length of the famous MacDougall Dog by three centimeters and that the Mother MacDougall Hot Apple Fritters be made in a rectangular shape rather than the traditional round form. Nationwide installation of the new system in all MacDougall's restaurants was completed on January 30, 2005. The 1,500 workhours per restaurant savings to MacDougall Corporation was projected at 1.8 million per year. TM sent a certified letter to the chief executive officer of MacDougall Corporation requesting his certification that the new food production system was in place and operating as promised, and demanding the 1.5 mathrm{mil} lion second installment. The CEO refused to so certify and refused to make any payment, noting in his reply letter that the system had not been installed by January 15,2005 , and that it did not use existing MacDougall's food products, as promised by TM. Was TM entitled to payment of the first installment when it completed design work on the new system on September 5, 2004? A. No, because substantial completion of installation of the system in Richmond restaurants would be a constructive condition precedent to MacDougall's duty to pay. B. No, because the phrase within 90 days of installation would be interpreted to mean within 90 days after installation. C. Yes, because September 5 was within 90 days of installation of the food processing system on October 1, 2004. D. Yes, because TM had completed work on designing the new system and could expect to install it within 90 days.

Mildred had recently had hip replacement surgery and could no longer attend to even minor household activities, and needed assistance in caring for the several thousand orchids she cultivated in her rooftop greenhouse. Mildred said to Sandra, I probably have about five years left, so if you will live here and take care of me and my flowers for the rest of my life, this house and the flowers will be yours. Sandra agreed, and moved from her parents' home in Yonkers to the brownstone in Manhattan. Mildred lived for eight years after Sandra came to live with her. Sandra attended to Mildred's personal needs, an increasing necessity as Mildred grew more frail. Sandra also maintained the household, did the shopping, cooking, etc., and cared, with less and less assistance from Mildred, for the numerous orchids. Mildred's moderate income from her investments provided the money necessary to support the household. No further discussion was ever had between Mildred and Sandra regarding conveyance of the brownstone and its contents. Shortly after Mildred died, Sandra was contacted by a Mr. Cramer, who identified himself as Mildred's lawyer and stated that he was in possession of Mildred's last will and testament and would seek to have it admitted to probate. In the subsequent proceedings, it was revealed that Mildred had devised her orchids to a Nero Wolfe, also residing in Manhattan, and her investments, the house, and the remainder of her estate, to her daughter who lived in California and whom Mildred had not seen or heard from in over 15 years. When Sandra refused to vacate the brownstone or surrender the orchids, Cramer, now representing Mildred's daughter, brought action for possession of the house. If Sandra prevails in the action brought by Mildred's daughter, it will be because: A. She can successfully assert the doctrine of unclean hands to prevent Mildred's daughter from pressing her claim under the will. B. The Statute of Frauds need not be satisfied as between family members. C.

Both were in their final year of high school; Shelley was one month short of her 18th birthday, and Herman was 19 . They went to a local jeweler and looked at gold wedding bands, but saw nothing that appealed to them. When they discovered that the jeweler was himself a goldsmith and could make rings to order, they described what they were interested in and signed a purchase order for two rings; a woman's band for 500 and a man's for 650. Three weeks later, the jeweler called Shelley and informed her that the rings were ready. In the meantime, she and Herman had broken up and Herman had enlisted in the Marines and been sent to another state for training. The day after her 18th birthday, Shelley went to the jeweler and told him that they would not be needing the rings. When he protested that they were custommade and would probably not sell to anyone else, Shelley said, All right, I've got 400 in my savings account. I'll take my ring, but you'll have to find Herman about the other one. The jeweler had Shelley sign another purchase order for the woman's band at 400, payment to be made by the end of the month. When the jeweler did not hear from Shelley after another month, he brought an action for breach of contract against her. Evidence produced at trial established that the market value of the rings was 500 and 650 for the woman's and man's, respectively, and that the age of majority in the jurisdiction was 18. Is the jeweler entitled to recover against Shelley? A. Yes, in the amount of 1,150. B. Yes, in the amount of 500. C. Yes, in the amount of 400. D.

To try to generate money to satisfy his creditors, Baxter promised to pay his friend Dunn 100 if Dunn would enter Baxter's house that evening and take his expensive color television and stereo. Baxter explained that he would then report the items as being stolen to the insurance company and collect a settlement from them. Baxter gave Dunn directions to his home, which was one of several tract houses in a fairly new development. Baxter told Dunn to arrive at approximately 9 p.m. and to enter through a window at the rear of the house that Baxter would leave ajar. Dunn knew that since Baxter lived alone, there was no possibility that he might find someone within the house when he arrived at the appointed time. Dunn arrived at the location at approximately 9 p.m., but due to the darkness of the evening and the fact that all of the homes in the development looked the same, he mistakenly entered the house belonging to Baxter's neighbor. He found a window ajar at the rear of the neighbor's home and pushed it open. He entered and took the neighbor's television set and stereo. When he returned to the bar where Baxter was waiting for him, both men were arrested by the police. If Dunn is charged with burglary, his best argument for acquittal would be that: A. He acted under a mistake of law. B. There was no breaking. C. There was no entry. D. He reasonably thought that he was in Baxter's home.

While out drinking with several fellow members one evening, Jesse got into an argument with a soldier from the nearby Army base and was bested in a brief exchange of punches. Feeling humiliated, he went to a different bar and drank a considerable amount of liquor. Vowing revenge on the soldier who had beaten him, Jesse and his friends drove out to the Army base. Using infiltration tactics practiced on weekends, they surreptitiously approached what they believed to be the barracks where the soldier slept. As Jesse was climbing through the window he had jimmied, a military police officer happened by and challenged him. In a tussle with the MP, Jessie struck the MP with his own baton, killing him. Still extremely intoxicated, Jesse abandoned the idea of finding and severely beating the soldier, and staggered to a nearby armored vehicle park. Since he was a heavy equipment operator, Jesse was familiar with the operation of such vehicles, and soon was driving an armored personnel carrier through the streets of the base and then out into the city. A curious police officer followed the armored vehicle for a few blocks, then pulled alongside in an attempt to determine whether it was on official Army business. At that moment, Jesse swerved the armored personnel carrier to the left, crushing the police car as it ground to a halt. The police officer inside was killed. The jurisdiction's statutes define murder as the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another in the commission of robbery, rape, burglary, or arson. Manslaughter is defined as the killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner. Criminal recklessness is consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct. The statutory definition of burglary is identical to the common law except that the prohibited conduct need not occur in the nighttime. The jurisdiction's statutes provide that intoxication is not a defense to a crime unless it negates an element of the offense. In a separate proceeding, Jesse is tried for manslaughter in connection with the death of the city police officer. The prosecution's best reply to Jesse's defense of intoxication in the charged manslaughter is that: A. Whether Jesse was intoxicated is not the crucial issue; whether the manner in which he was operating the armored personnel carrier was criminally reckless is determinative. B. Conscious risk taking refers to Jesse's entire course of conduct, including drinking with the knowledge that he might become intoxicated and perform an act that might severely injure or kill someone. C. Intoxication is a defense to a crime only if the intoxication is involuntary. D. Intoxication is not a defense to the crime charged, because at common law manslaughter is a general intent crime.

The police were notified and they arrived at Dennis's house a few hours after the robbery. They knocked on the door and announced their presence, and saw someone matching the description of the robber in the hallway.

Local zoning regulations required that all homes in the area of the 5100 block of Elm Street be set back a minimum of 35 feet from the sidewalk. Dampier purchased a lot on the 5100 block of Elm Street on which it would be possible to build a home with a 50foot setback. However, the lot was of an unusual shape, and Dampier applied to the city zoning commission asking for a variance allowing him to build a house set back 30 feet from the sidewalk. In his petition, Dampier cited the unusual shape of the lot and asserted that it would cause hardship for him to build in compliance with the 35foot setback required by the zoning regulations. The zoning commission granted Dampier the variance. Nora, whose home was located at 5130 Elm Street, noticed surveyors putting up ropes 30 feet from the sidewalk on Dampier's lot, and she discovered that Dampier planned to build a home with only a 30 foot setback. Nora seeks to enforce the restrictive covenant and brings suit to enjoin Dampier from building a residence with a setback of less than 50 feet. Who will prevail? A. Dampier, because zoning regulations take precedence over restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy. B. Dampier, because equity will not impose a hardship. C.

Growers of potatoes in North Freedonia recently began spraying Bugoff onto their crops to prevent the spread of the Potato Maggot, an insect that can destroy young potato plants. Bugoff is manufactured exclusively by Growit, Inc., at its plant in South Freedonia. When the plant is producing Bugoff it emits a fine, sticky, harmless mist as a byproduct. The mist drifts over Clampett's property which is adjacent to Growit's plant. Although Growit uses the best technology available, it is unable to prevent the release of the mist. Clampett brings suit against Growit on the theory of private nuisance to enjoin the production of Bugoff at the South Freedonia plant. Which of the following facts, if established, will be most helpful to Growit's defense? A. Growit commenced the manufacture of Bugoff at the South Freedonia plant three years before Clampett acquired the land adjacent to the plant. B. Federal, state, and local agencies approved the design of the plant and equipment used to produce Bugoff. C. The principal users of Bugoff are State and Federal Departments of Agriculture. D. Bugoff is the only pesticide that can safely and effectively kill the Potato Maggot, which, if not controlled, would destroy North Freedonia's potato crop, its principal product.

Auto Modifiers, Inc., of the state of Midwest won the contract as low bidder and began manufacture of the vehicles. Midwest statutes require that automobiles manufactured in that state be equipped with certain antipollution devices and have a maximum displacement of 2,500 cubic centimeters. The specifications of the federal contract require Auto Modifiers to manufacture the utility vehicles without the antipollution devices and with engines with a displacement of 4,000 cubic centimeters. When the president of Auto Modifiers learns that the Midwest Attorney General's office is investigating the manufacture of the government vehicles, he instructs his legal department to take affirmative action to protect the company. Auto Modifiers then files suit in state court for declaratory relief, seeking a judicial declaration that the state statute prescribing antipollution devices and engine size may not be enforced as to it. The court should rule: A. The statute may not constitutionally be applied to Auto Modifiers in this instance because to do so would violate the mathrm{Su} premacy Clause. B.

Wyoming state law grants each county great autonomy in setting the health standards governing the preparation, packaging, transportation, and sale of foodstuffs. The Pecos County council recently enacted an ordinance, valid under the constitution and statutes of Wyoming, prohibiting the packaging and sale of any food item in any nonbiodegradable material; the ordinance defines nonbiodegradable and specifically lists as prohibited all forms of plastics, cellophane, or similar materials. The ordinance specifically exempts from its terms sales of food to public institutions such as hospitals, jails, and schools. SnakMart, a retail food seller in East Rabbit's Foot, files an appropriate court action attacking the Pecos County ordinance on the grounds that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court should rule: A. For SnakMart, because the state's interests could be effectuated by alternative methods less intrusive upon SnakMart's constitutional rights. B. For SnakMart, because no compelling state interest is served by the challenged ordinance. C. For Pecos County, because the state may regulate in this area as Congress has not entered the field. D.

Another city ordinance prescribed fines for persons conducting a parade in the city of Bedford without a permit. The Reverend Jim, leader of the Poor People's Association (PPA), filed appropriate papers with city officials to parade down Main Street in the city of Bedford at 1 p.m. on July 15 . City officials checked their records and noted that they had already issued a parade permit to the Little League Baseball Supporters to conduct a parade on Main Street at 1 p.m. on July 15 .

Jim refused and told the city officials, This is yet another insult to the poor from this administration. We poor people will march on Main Street any time we please, with or without your permits! On July 15 at 1 p.m. both Little League and PPA assembled on Main Street and began to parade. There was much confusion. City officials asked Jim and his followers to desist, but they refused.

Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, Jack obtained a bucket from the tool shed, filled it with ice water, and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, knowing that his father would take the guests' coats and wraps in there and toss them on the bed.

She discovered that the old set of dishware and utensils she had permitted the couple to use was still in the kitchen, but that there was no food in the house and all but a few old items of clothing had been removed from the closets. Concluding that the couple had abandoned the rental without paying the last month's rent, Shelley called the power company and had the electricity and gas shut off until she could find another tenant. A week later, the couple returned from an extended visit to the young wife's sick mother in Mexico. When they found that their power had been turned off, they reported this to the authorities and Shelley was prosecuted under the misdemeanor statute. At trial, it was established that the couple had inadvertently failed to place the proper postage on the rent check, which they had mailed from Mexico, and it had eventually been returned by Mexican postal authorities to the wife's mother's residence.

A. Defendant posed as a member of a cleaning crew so that a security guard would give him access to a department store after it was closed for the night, and then hid in a storage closet until the cleaning crew left. He then stole a quantity of jewelry from several jewelry cases, and forced open a loading dock door to escape from the building. B. Defendant, intending to steal money and valuables from a house he believed was unoccupied for the evening, pushed open a mail slot and reached his hand in to try to unlock the front door. The owners' dog bit Defendant's hand and he immediately pulled it out and fled. C. Defendant was owed 500 by Victor, his bookie. While Victor was out of town one night, Defendant went to Victor's house to get his money, because he knew that Victor had 500 in cash in a desk drawer and the debt was long overdue. Defendant opened an unlocked window and entered the house. He could not find the cash, so he decided to take a painting that he knew was worth substantially more than 500. He later sold it for 1,000 and kept the proceeds. D. Defendant, a security officer in a housing project, saw Von, who was wanted on a warrant for drug dealing, through a window of an apartment one evening.

It owned its own garage for repairing and maintaining its fleet. Behind this garage was a large vacant lot in which Cantebury Trails stored old, discarded, and wrecked buses, which it salvaged for parts or sold for scrap. This area was fenced in by a fivefoot high chain link fence, but Cantebury was aware that children from the neighborhood would climb the fence and play among the junked buses. Consequently, Cantebury Trails would have one of its employees walk through the storage area sometime during the day to chase away any children who may have scaled the fence. One Saturday afternoon, when Cantebury Trails' garage had closed for the weekend, a group of children climbed over the storage area's fence to play army among the junked buses. One of the children, Donny (who had been chased away from the lot before and who also had been warned by his parents not to play in these buses), was trying to climb on the roof of one of the old buses, when he slipped on the front bumper of the bus and his arm broke through the front windshield. As a result of this accident, Donny severed the tendon and nerves in his right arm, leaving it permanently disabled. Through an appropriate guardian, Donny brought suit against Cantebury Trails for his injury. Which of the following, if established, would most aid Donny in showing that Cantebury Trails breached a duty owing to him? A. It would have been economically feasible to remove the windows from all the abandoned buses. B. This area would be classified more as a residential neighborhood than an industrial area. C.

Granted, because once Dillon was convicted on any of the charges arising out of the robbery, the prosecution was constitutionally estopped from proceeding against Dillon on any charge stemming from the same transaction. B. Granted, because the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a subsequent trial on what is essentially a lesser included offense. C.

When he became aware of a sudden demand for beeswax for use in the manufacture of candles and certain types of exotic soaps sold in specialty shops, he built a plant to manufacture these items. The candle and soap business developed so rapidly that Barnes found it profitable to sell his bee farm to Stevens for 50,000. The sale contract provided that Barnes reserves the right to purchase all of the beeswax produced by Stevens during the next five years at the current market price at time of delivery, delivery and payment to be made at weekly intervals, and Stevens agrees to supply in any event a minimum of 100 pounds of beeswax per month during that period.' When the sale was closed, Barnes's lawyer handed Stevens's lawyer a letter stating: This is to notify you that I will take all of your beeswax production until further notice.' For one year, Stevens delivered to Barnes and Barnes paid for all of the beeswax produced by Stevens. During that year, Stevens, who was an expert beekeeper, increased his beeswax production by 100 % by increasing the number and productivity of the bees. Stevens then proposed to Barnes that, since he had doubled production, it would only be fair that he supply Barnes with half of his new total, but in any event a minimum of 100 pounds per month, leaving Stevens free to sell the remainder of the wax at higher prices for new uses being made of beeswax. Barnes, in a signed writing, agreed to the proposal by Stevens for the remaining period of the original contract. During the following year, Stevens delivered to Barnes, and Barnes paid for, onehalf of all of the beeswax produced by Stevens. As the first year of the new contract ended, Stevens was stung by a bee and, due to an allergy, became so seriously and permanently ill and impaired as to be unable to attend to the bees. From that time on he never made another delivery to Barnes. Jones offered to testify that he looked up Smith's telephone number in the directory, called that number, and that a voice answered, This is Smith speaking. At this, Jones asked, Was that your horse that tramped across my cornfield this afternoon? The voice replied, Yes. The judge should rule the testimony: A. Admissible, because the answering speaker's identification of himself, together with the usual accuracy of the telephone directory and transmission system, furnishes sufficient authentication. B. Admissible, because judicial notice may be taken of the accuracy of telephone directories. C.

Several state officials serve on the Bar Association's Board of Bar Governors. The Board of Bar Governors authorizes the payment of dues for two staff members to the Cosmopolitan Club, a private dining club licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. The Cosmopolitan Club is frequented by affluent businessmen and professionals and by legislators. It is generally known that the purpose of the membership of the Bar Association staff is to enable them to go where members of the elite meet and to lobby for legislation in which the Bar Association is interested. The State Association has numerous committees and subcommittees concerned with family law, real estate law, unauthorized practice, etc., and its recommendations often influence state policy. Some committee meetings are held at the Cosmopolitan Club. The club is known to have rules which restrict membership by race, religion, and sex. Plaintiffs, husband and wife, who are members of the Erewhon Bar Association, petition the Board of Bar Governors to adopt a resolution prohibiting the payment of club dues to and the holding of meetings of the Bar Association or its committees at places that discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or sex. After substantial public discussion, the Board of Bar Governors, by a close vote, fails to pass such a resolution. These events receive extensive coverage in the local newspapers. Plaintiffs bring an action in federal court seeking an injunction against such payments and the holding of meetings in such places as the Cosmopolitan Club. The strongest argument for Plaintiffs is: A. Private rights to discriminate and associate freely must defer to a public interest against discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or sex. B. The failure of the State Bar Association to pass a resolution forbidding discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or sex constitutes a denial of equal protection. C. The State Bar Association is an agency of the state and its payment of dues to such private clubs promotes discrimination on the basis of race, religion, and sex. D.

After constructing and selling 12,500 of the units, Fernwood sold its interest in the development to Gaint Realty Investors. Gaint operated the power plant and constructed and sold the remaining 12,500 units. Each conveyance from Gaint contained the same covenant relating to electrical power that Fernwood had included in the 12,500 conveyances it had made. Page bought a dwelling unit from Olm, who had purchased it from Fernwood. Subsequently, Page, whose lot was along the boundary of the Fernwood development, ceased buying electrical power from Gaint and began purchasing power from General Power Company, which provided such service in the area surrounding the Fernwood development. Both General Power and Gaint have governmental authorization to provide electrical services to the area. Gaint instituted an appropriate action against Page to enjoin her from obtaining electrical power from General Power. If judgment is for Page, it most likely will be because: A. The covenant does not touch and concern the land. B. The mixture of types of residential units is viewed as preventing one common development scheme. C. The covenant is a restraint on alienation. D. There is no privity of estate between Page and Gaint. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"Pullen used aluminum brackets in her business. On the telephone listed as hers in the telephone book, Pullen received a call in which the caller said, This is John Denison of Denison Hardware Company. We have a special on aluminum brackets this week at 30 % off. Pullen ordered brackets from the caller. When the brackets were never delivered, Pullen sued Denison for breach of contract. At trial, Denison, who denies having made the telephone call, objects to Pullen's testimony concerning it. When asked, Pullen testifies that, aside from the telephone call, she had never heard Denison speak until she met him in the judge's chambers before the trial and that, in her opinion, the voice on the telephone was Denison's. The strongest argument for admission of Pullen's testimony concerning the telephone call is that: A. The call related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone. B. The call was received at a number assigned to Pullen by the telephone company. C. After hearing Denison speak in chambers, Pullen recognized Denison's voice as that of the person on the telephone. D.

Ben planned to build a highrise building on Woodacre. Ben had visually inspected the land, but did not take any special notice of the fact that a stream flowed up to the eastern property line of Woodacre and reappeared just beyond the western property line. In fact, there was a conduit under the surface of Woodacre through which the waters of the stream were diverted. On July 28 , one of Ben's friends mentioned the existence of the conduit to Ben. Ben was amazed, and when Owen tendered a deed to Woodacre on August 1, Ben refused to accept it, stating, I wouldn't have tried to buy Woodacre if I'd known about that conduit. Owen files suit, demanding performance by Ben or damages for breach. Who should prevail? A. Owen, because Ben had ample opportunity to discover the existence of the conduit before he agreed to buy Woodacre. B. Owen, because the purpose for which Ben intended to use Woodacre is irrelevant. C. Ben, because Owen had a duty to provide a marketable title. D. Ben, because of the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

In her application, Norris listed her former employment with Josephs. Josephs, in response to a telephone inquiry from Hospital, stated that Norris lacked professional competence. Although Josephs believed that to be a fair assessment of Norris, his adverse rating was based on one episode of malpractice for which he blamed Norris but which in fact was chargeable to another doctor. Because of Josephs's adverse comment on her qualifications, Norris was not employed by Hospital. If Norris asserts a claim based on defamation against Josephs, will Norris prevail? A. Yes, because Josephs was mistaken in the facts on which he based his opinion of Norris's competence. B. Yes, because Josephs's statement reflected adversely on Norris's professional competence. C. No, if Norris authorized Hospital to make inquiry of her former employer. D. No, if Josephs had reasonable grounds for his belief that Norris was not competent.

He was qualified for such assistance in every way except that he was a resident alien who did not intend to become a United States citizen. The state's restriction of such grants to United States citizens or resident aliens seeking such citizenship is probably: A. Valid, because aliens are not per se a discrete and insular minority specially protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. B. Valid, because the line drawn by the state for extending aid was reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. C. Invalid, because the justifications for this restriction are insufficient to overcome the burden imposed on a state when it uses such an alienage classification. D.

The company owns and maintains all of the electric poles and equipment in City. Light Company has complied with the National Electrical Safety Code, which establishes minimum requirements for the installation and maintenance of power poles. The Code has been approved by the federal and state governments. Light Company has had to replace insulators on its poles repeatedly because unknown persons repeatedly shoot at and destroy them. This causes the power lines to fall to the ground. On one of these occasions, Paul, Faber's fiveyearold son, wandered out of Faber's yard, intentionally touched a downed wire, and was seriously burned. If a claim on Paul's behalf is asserted against Light Company, the probable result is that Paul will: A. Recover if Light Company could have taken reasonable steps to prevent the lines from falling when the insulators were destroyed. B. Recover, because a supplier of electricity is strictly liable in tort. C. Not recover unless Light Company failed to exercise reasonable care to stop the destruction of the insulators. D.

Both civil and criminal penalties are established for violation of the Act, and it permits private civil suits for injunctive relief or for damages to enforce its provisions. The city of Davis, California also enacted a jobs opportunity ordinance effective the same year, requiring that any employer doing business with the city have a workforce consonant with the ethnic and gender composition of the population of the city. The local ordinance permits employers to apply for exemptions from its requirements if they can demonstrate that the pool of potential qualified employees has a different mix of ethnicity or gender than the general population. The population of Davis is approximately 55 % female and 45 % male, 75 % white, 10 % Asian, 7% black, 7% Hispanic, and 1 % other ethnic backgrounds. Watson Janitorial Service, a private employer located in the city of Davis, does contract cleaning and maintenance for both the local United States Department of Agriculture office and for the City Jail. Its workforce is 95 % male, 55 % black, 40 % Hispanic, and 5 % other ethnic backgrounds. The city of Davis notified the company that it would either have to bring its workforce into compliance with the local job opportunity ordinance or its contract with the City Jail would be terminated. The United States Department of Justice has notified Watson Janitorial that it meets the guidelines of the Fair Opportunity Act, and that the contract with the Department of Agriculture is not in jeopardy. 6. Watson Janitorial brings an action in state court to enjoin enforcement of the Davis ordinance. It argues that the local rule is invalid since it conflicts with the federal statute by creating more stringent standards. The trial court should rule: (A) There is no conflict, since Congress intended only that the Fair Opportunity Act apply to employers who dealt exclusively with the federal government. (B) There is no conflict, since Davis is permitted to impose more strict requirements to a local problem than those established by the federal government. (C) The federal act preempts the local ordinance and thus the latter cannot be enforced. (D) The federal act preempts the local ordinance only insofar as it attempts to regulate employers who do business with the federal government, so the ordinance may not be enforced only as to Watson Janitorial, but is otherwise valid. Jordan is an accomplice to: A. Murder. B. Manslaughter. C. Criminally negligent homicide. D. No degree of criminal homicide.

Peterson's fee for his services was 105, which did not include the entrance fees for several of the historical sites. Other persons and organizations conducted various American history tours through the city for somewhat less than Peterson, but Peterson's tour was generally rated the best by the leading tourist guidebooks because Peterson personally conducted the tours and shared his encyclopedic knowledge of American history and the city of Philadelphia. David had recently moved to Philadelphia, and all of his coworkers praised Professor Peterson's tour, but David was not inclined to pay 105 for a tour of the historical sites of his new city. Therefore, David took a day off one Thursday and hung around the Liberty Bell monument, where Peterson's tour started. That day Peterson was conducting 27 persons on the tour. Most of the participants had paid in advance, but Peterson was holding up a sign with information about the tour and handing out brochures, one of which David took. Peterson accepted a few additional participants who signed up on the spot, but David was not among them. All day long, David hung around at the fringe of this group, paying the entrance fees separately but following the group through the different historical sites. However, he always positioned himself close enough to Peterson's group so that he could hear virtually every word of Peterson's lecture, although David did not ask Peterson any questions. David signed his name and address on the register at Independence Hall. Peterson noted this and took down the information. Two days after the tour concluded, David received a bill from Peterson in the amount of 105. David will most likely be required to pay Peterson: A. 105, because that is the contract price for the tour. B. 105, because the amount of the contract was less than 500, making the Statute of Frauds inapplicable. C. 105, if that is a reasonable fee for the lectures based on Peterson's expertise. D.

Curious about what was going on inside, the officer tried to look through the window of the shop, but it had been painted on the inside so that only a strip about three inches at the top, eight feet above street level, was still transparent. Officer Murdoch quietly brought two trash cans from a neighboring business over to the window, stood on them and saw, through the strip of unpainted window, that the shop owner's son Tommy was inside with a friend, sucking white powder into his nose through a rolled up tube of paper from off a small mirror. Recognizing from his experience and training that Tommy was snorting cocaine, Officer Murdoch knocked at the front door to the shop, and Tommy let him in. Murdoch immediately arrested Tommy and his friend. In the back room of the shop through whose window he had peered, Murdoch found and seized several grams of cocaine, a razor blade, and a mirror. In Tommy's subsequent prosecution for possession of cocaine, Tommy seeks to bar introduction of the cocaine, mirror, and razor blade into evidence. His motion will probably be: A. Granted, because Officer Murdoch could not have known that Tommy was snorting cocaine absent a chemical test of the substance being snorted. B. Granted, because Officer Murdoch violated Tommy's reasonable expectation of privacy. C. Denied, because the search was incident to a valid arrest. D.

The contract provided that Bouquet would invest 1 million in Vintage for its capital expansion and, in return, that Vintage, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under the label Premium VintageBouquet. The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by Vintage only through Claret, a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither Bouquet nor Vintage had previously dealt with Claret. Claret learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility. 81. If Vintage refuses to distribute the wine through Claret and Claret then sues Vintage for breach of contract, is it likely that Claret will prevail? (A) Yes, because Vintage's performance was to run to Claret rather than to Bouquet. (B) Yes, because Bouquet and Vintage could reasonably foresee that Claret would change his position in reliance on the contract. (C) No, because Bouquet and Vintage did not expressly agree that Claret would have enforceable rights under their contract. (D) No, because Bouquet and Vintage, having no apparent motive to benefit Claret, appeared in making the contract to have been protecting or serving only their own interests. For this question only, assume the following facts. Amicusbank lent Bouquet 200,000 and Bouquet executed a written instrument providing that Amicusbank is entitled to collect the debt from my share of the profits, if any, under the VintageBouquet contract. Amicusbank gave prompt notice of this transaction to Vintage. If Vintage thereafter refuses to account for any profits to Amicusbank and Amicusbank sues Vintage for Bouquet's share of profits then realized, Vintage's strongest argument in defense is that: A. The BouquetVintage contract did not expressly authorize an assignment of rights. B. Bouquet and Vintage are partners, not simply debtor and creditor. C. Amicusbank is not an assignee of Bouquet's rights under the BouquetVintage contract. D. Amicusbank is not an intended thirdparty beneficiary of the BouquetVintage contract.

Bert, who had lived in Metropolis all of his 67 years, was out windowshopping with his wife, Ruth, also 67 , when he saw a friend across the street at a diner they both frequented. Telling Ruth that he would be right back, he saw that there were no cars nearby and so strode briskly across the street in the middle of the block. As he reached the other sidewalk, a police officer who had been checking parked cars for parking violations stepped up to Bert and said, Hold it buddy, let's see your driver's license, and then reached for her citation book. Bert, a city dweller from birth, had always walked or used public transportation, had never learned to drive, and did not have a driver's license. When he told the officer that he did not have a driver's license, she said, All right, I'm taking you in, and seized his wrist, twisting it up and behind him in a personnel control lock. A black belt in judo, Bert easily slipped the officer's grasp. You asked for it, she then growled, and pulled her baton from her belt. When she attempted to strike Bert, he moved swiftly to the side, chopped at her arm, and caused the baton to fall from her grasp to the pavement. At that point two other officers arrived on the scene and arrested Bert. Ruth watched the entire episode from across the street and became greatly distressed. 34. Bert brings an action against the first officer for battery. What will be the probable outcome of this litigation? (A) He will lose, because he struck the officer.

Walter insisted that Barbara proceed with the sale, and brought an action to compel her performance. If the court were to find that title is marketable, it will be because: A. The wheelchair ramp is required by federal law. B. Walter currently owns Whiteacre and acquired Whiteacre and Blackacre as part of a larger parcel. C. The wheelchair ramp extends only 10 inches over the property line. D. The contract between Walter and Barbara requires Walter to convey only a quitclaim deed.

Dellacourt, who was standing nearby, turned quickly and made a move as if to approach Winchester, and so Winchester ran down the sidewalk away from Dellacourt to summon the police. The following exchange then occurred during crossexamination of Winchester by Dellacourt's counsel. D: You didn't actually see my client bite off the plaintiff's ear, did you, Mr. Winchester? W: No. D: For all you know, my client could have been an innocent bystander like yourself, but one who didn't run away but stayed to offer assistance.

The state legislature quickly responded to the public outcry. With the stated aim of protecting minors from the perceived evils of offensive but not necessarily obscene materials, the legislature enacted a statute banning the commercial licensing of video arcade games with a specifically defined degree of graphic violent or sexual content. Delmar, the owner of a chain of video arcades in State Russet shopping malls, was denied licenses for a number of video games that he wanted to install at his arcades. He challenges the state's action in federal district court. The court will probably find the State Russet statute: A. Constitutional, because for materials accessible to minors, the state may adopt a different standard for determining whether the material is offensive or obscene than the standard it applies for adults. B. Constitutional, because the statute precisely defines the type of content that is prohibited in the video games. C. Unconstitutional, because narrower means are available to deny minors access to the objectionable material without affecting rights of adults. D. Unconstitutional, because some of the banned video games may have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, as determined by contemporary community standards, and thus do not fall within the definition of obscenity.

The officer ordered Davison from the car, searched him, and discovered marijuana cigarettes and a shotgun. At Davison's trial for unlawful possession of narcotics, his motion to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence should be: A. Sustained, because the marijuana was discovered as a result of the unlawful stopping of Davison's automobile. B. Sustained, because the use of the flashlight constituted a search of the interior of Davison's automobile without probable cause. C.

Subsequently, they made an oral agreement that, on the death of either of them, the survivor would own the entire condominium, and, as a result, they decided they did not need wills. Two years later, Taylor and Scott were involved in the same automobile accident. Taylor was killed immediately. Scott died one week later. Both died intestate. Taylor's sole heir is his brother, Mark. Scott's sole heir is her mother, Martha. Mark claimed onehalf of the condominium, and Martha claimed all of it. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute except for the Statute of Frauds; nor does it recognize common law marriages. In an appropriate action by Martha claiming the entire ownership of the condominium, the court will find that: A. Martha owns the entire interest because Taylor and Scott did not make wills in reliance upon their oral agreement. B. Martha owns the entire interest because she is entitled to reformation of the deed to reflect the oral agreement. C. Mark and Martha each own an undivided onehalf interest because Taylor and Scott each died as the result of the same accident. D.

After Keith's arrest for selling cocaine out of his home, a felony, the state instituted an action of forfeiture against Keith's house and property. After notice to Keith and a hearing, a judge granted the order and the state seized the property. Six months later, after the time for any appeals had expired, the property was sold at a public auction to a third party. It was only when the third party brought an action to quiet title that Northwest Bank, the holder of a properly recorded mortgage on Keith's property, learned of the forfeiture. Because the bank's mortgage payments were automatically deducted from an account Keith had under a different name, no one at the bank was aware that the property had been seized. The only notice provided to parties other than Keith was a public notice published for three weeks in a general circulation newspaper. The bank defends the quiet title action on the ground that it did not receive the notice required under the United States Constitution to protect its interest in the property. If the court rules that Northwest Bank's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated by the state's seizure of the property, it will be because: A. In any judicial proceeding affecting rights to real property, a claimant is required to provide notice and an evidentiary hearing to all parties with a legal interest in the property before taking actions affecting their rights. B. The government itself was the party that seized the property, rather than a private party using governmental processes. C. The notice was not adequate under the circumstances to apprise a party with a properly recorded legal interest in the property. D. The jurisdiction treats the mortgagee as having title to the property rather than merely a lien.

At that time Silo was using bagged cement, which caused little or no dust. In 1970, Petrone bought a home approximately 1,800 feet from the Silo plant. One year ago, Silo stopped using bagged cement and began to receive cement in bulk shipments. Since then at least five truckloads of cement have passed Petrone's house daily. Cement blows off the trucks and into Petrone's house. When the cement arrives at the Silo plant, it is blown by forced air from the trucks into the storage bin. As a consequence, cement dust fills the air surrounding the plant to a distance of 2,000 feet. Petrone's house is the only residence within 2,000 feet of the plant. If Petrone asserts a claim against Silo based on nuisance, will Petrone prevail? A. Yes, unless using bagged cement would substantially increase Silo's costs. B. Yes, if the cement dust interfered unreasonably with the use and enjoyment of Petrone's property. C.

However, construction of the streets, utilities, and other aspects of the development of Meadowview has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the municipality in which Meadowview is located. College Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent oneacre parcel owned by White. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. White sold Whiteacre to Breyer. The description used in the deed from White to Breyer was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, thence by land of Black, northeasterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less, was changed to thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview North 16^{circ} East 201.6 feet, with full reference to the plan and as recording data. Breyer now seeks a building permit which will show that Breyer intends to use College Avenue for access to Whiteacre. Black objects to the granting of a building permit on the grounds that he has never granted any rights to White or Breyer to use College Avenue. There are no governing statutes or ordinances relating to the problem. Black brings an appropriate action in which the right of Breyer to use College Avenue without an express grant from Black is at issue. The best argument for Black in this action is that: A. Breyer's right must await the action of appropriate public authorities to open College Avenue as a public street, since no private easements arose by implication. B. The Statute of Frauds prevents the introduction of evidence which might prove the necessity for Breyer to use College Avenue. C.

When asked, she always said she was 22 , and she carried false identification saying she was that old. She frequented taverns and drank heavily. One evening in a bar she became acquainted with Duke. He believed her when she told him her claimed age. They had several drinks and became inebriated. Later, they drove in Duke's car to a secluded spot. After they had necked for a while, Duke propositioned Linda and she consented. Before Duke achieved penetration, Linda changed her mind, saying, Stop! Don't touch me! I don't want to do it. When Duke did not desist, Linda started to cry and said, I am only 15. Duke immediately jumped from the car and ran away. Duke was indicted for attempted rape, assault with intent to rape, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and attempted statutory rape. The age of consent in the jurisdiction is 16 . With respect to the contributing charge under the statute set out in the question above, proof by Duke that he was so inebriated that he could not have formed a criminal intent would be a: A. Good defense, because the charge requires a specific intent. B. Good defense, because at least a general criminal intent is required for every offense. C. Poor defense, because contributing to the delinquency of a minor is an offense against a child. D.

The grantee, Burton, constructed a public health center on the tract within the time specified and operated it for five years. At the end of this period, Burton converted the structure into a senior citizens' recreational facility. It is considered by all parties in interest that a senior citizens' recreational facility is not a public health center. In an appropriate action, Anders seeks a declaration that the change in the use of the facility has caused the land and structure to revert to her. In this action, Anders should: A. Win, because the language of the deed created a determinable fee, which leaves a possibility of reverter in the grantor. B. Win, because the language of the deed created a fee subject to condition subsequent, which leaves a right of entry or power of termination in the grantor. C.

The street in front of the home had a gradual slope. Doctor's garage was on the street level, with a driveway entrance from the street. At two in the morning, Doctor received an emergency call. She dressed and went to the garage to get her car and found a car parked in front of her driveway. That car was occupied by Parker, who, while intoxicated, had driven to that place and now was in a drunken stupor in the front seat. Unable to rouse Parker, Doctor pushed him into the passenger's side of the front seat and got in on the driver's side. Doctor released the brake and coasted the car down the street, planning to pull into a parking space that was open. When Doctor attempted to stop the car, the brakes failed to work, and the car crashed into the wall of Owner's home, damaging Owner's home and Parker's car and injuring Doctor and Parker. Subsequent examination of the car disclosed that the brake linings were badly worn. A state statute prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle unless the brakes are capable of stopping the vehicle within specified distances at specified speeds. The brakes on Parker's car were incapable of stopping the vehicle within the limits required by the statute. Another state statute makes it a criminal offense to be intoxicated while driving a motor vehicle. The state follows traditional contributory negligence rules. If Parker asserts a claim against Doctor for his injuries, Parker will probably: A. Recover, because Doctor was negligent as a matter of law. B. Recover, because Doctor had no right to move the car.

On crossexamination, Dr. Cox testified that a medical textbook entitled Diseases of the Joints was authoritative and that she agreed with the substance of passages from the textbook that she was directed to look at, but that the passages were inapplicable to Post's condition because they dealt with rheumatoid arthritis rather than with the osteoarthritis that Post was alleged to have. Dean then called his expert, Dr. Freed, who testified that, with reference to the issue being litigated, there is no difference between the two kinds of arthritis.

The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. Ogden conveyed Lot 1 to Akers and Lot 2 to Bell. Ogden retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. Bell, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on his lot. Bell's house included a large window on the side facing Lot 3 . The window provided a beautiful view from Bell's living room, thereby adding value to Bell's house. Akers erected a house on his lot. Ogden made no complaint to either Akers or Bell concerning the houses they built. After both Akers and Bell had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that onehalf of the way was located on each lot. Akers and Bell exchanged rightofway deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded. After Akers and Bell had lived in their respective houses for 30 years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3 . Akers informed Bell that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the rightofway terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected Bell to do the same. At about the same time, Ogden began the erection of a sixstory apartment house on Lot 3 . If the apartment house is completed, it will block the view from Bell's window and will substantially reduce the value of Bell's lot. In an action brought by Bell to enjoin Ogden from erecting the apartment building in such a way as to obstruct the view from Bell's living room window, the decision should be for: A. Bell, because Ogden's proposed building would be an obstruction of Bell's natural right to an easement for light and air. B. Bell, because Bell was misled by Ogden's failure to complain when Bell was building his house. C. Ogden if, but only if, it can be shown that Ogden's intention to erect such a building was made known to Bell at or prior to the time of Ogden's conveyance to Bell. D. Ogden, because Bell has no easement for light, air, or view.

As a part of its work, Construction Company dug a trench from the partially completed laundry to the edge of a public sidewalk; waterlines were to be installed in the trench. Because of the contour of the land, the trench was dug to a depth ranging from seven to nine feet. Construction Company did not place any barriers around the trench and permitted it to lie open for almost a week while waiting for the delivery of water pipes. This was known to Wash Company, but it raised no objection. During the time the trench was open, a series of heavy rains fell, causing five feet of surface water to gather in the bottom of the trench. While this condition existed, fiveyearold Tommy, who was playing on the vacant lot with friends, stumbled and fell into the trench. Robert, an adult passerby, saw this and immediately lowered himself into the trench to rescue Tommy. However, his doing so caused the rainsoaked walls of the trench to collapse, killing both him and Tommy. In a claim for wrongful death by Tommy's administrator against Construction Company, the most likely result is that plaintiff will: A. Recover, because the defendant left the open trench unprotected. B. Recover, because construction companies are strictly liable for inherently dangerous conditions. C. Not recover, because Tommy was a trespasser. D. Not recover, because Tommy's death was a result of the collapse of the trench, an independent intervening cause.

Because of his low charge for his work, they agreed in writing that on acceptance of his job by Householder, he would have no further liability to her or to anyone else for any defects in materials or workmanship, and that she would bear all such costs. Householder purchased a dishwasher manufactured by Elex Company from Dealer, who was in the retail electrical appliance business. The washer was sold by Dealer with only the manufacturer's warranty and with no warranty by Dealer; Elex Company restricted its warranty to 90 days on parts and labor. Contractor installed the dishwasher. Two months after Householder accepted the entire job, she was conversing in her home with Accountant, an acquaintance who had agreed to prepare her income tax return gratuitously. As they talked, they noticed that the dishwasher was operating strangely, repeatedly stopping and starting. At Householder's request, Accountant gave it a cursory examination and, while inspecting it, received a violent electrical shock which did him extensive harm. The dishwasher had an internal wiring defect that allowed electrical current to be carried into the framework and caused the machine to malfunction. The machine had not been adequately grounded by Contractor during installation; if it had been, the current would have been led harmlessly away. The machine carried instructions for correct grounding, which Contractor had not followed.

There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the southeast corner, for traffic on Pine Street. Trucker was making a delivery to a market on the east side of Maple Street, just north of its intersection with Pine Street. There being insufficient space for his truck and enclosed trailer, he parked it with the rear of the trailer extending entirely across the crosswalk on the north side of the intersection. The height of the trailer was such that it entirely obscured the traffic light on the northeast corner from the view of traffic moving east on Pine Street. Unknown to Trucker, the traffic light at the southeast corner was not functioning, because a collision 72 hours earlier had knocked down the pole from which the light was suspended. Visitor, on his first trip to City, was driving east on Pine Street. Not seeing any traffic light or pole, he entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. Driver, proceeding north on Maple Street and seeing the green light, entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck Visitor's car.

The deed was properly recorded. Newacre then passed through several intermediate conveyances until it was conveyed to Sloan about 10 years after the date of the rightofway deed. All the intermediate deeds were properly recorded, but none of them mentioned the rightofway. Sloan entered into a written contract to sell Newacre to Jones. By the terms of the contract, Sloan promised to furnish an abstract of title to Jones. Sloan contracted directly with Abstract Company to prepare and deliver an abstract to Jones, and Abstract Company did so. The abstract omitted the rightofway deed. Jones delivered the abstract to his attorney and asked the attorney for an opinion as to title. The attorney signed and delivered to Jones a letter stating that, from the attorney's examination of the abstract, it was his opinion that Sloan had a free and unencumbered marketable title to Newacre. Sloan conveyed Newacre to Jones by a deed which included covenants of general warranty and against encumbrances. Jones paid the full purchase price. After Jones had been in possession of Newacre for more than a year, he learned about the rightofway deed. Sloan, Jones, Abstract Company, and Jones's attorney were all without actual knowledge of the existence of the rightofway prior to the conveyance from Sloan to Jones. If Jones sues Sloan because of the presence of the rightofway, the most likely result will be a decision for: A. Jones, because Sloan is liable for his negligent misrepresentation. B.

The clerks were busy, and one of them told him that he should wait on himself. Customer selected three suits from a rack and went into the dressing room to try them on. Signs posted on the walls of the Store state that closing time is 9 p.m.; however, because of a special awards banquet for employees, Store was closed at 7 p.m. on this day. The employees, in a hurry to get to the banquet, did not check the dressing rooms or turn off the lights before leaving. When Customer emerged from the dressing room a few minutes after 7 p.m., he was alone and locked in. Customer tried the front door but it was secured on the outside by a bar and padlock, so he went to the rear door. Customer grabbed the doorknob and vigorously shook the door. It did not open, but the activity set off a mechanism that had been installed because of several recent thefts committed by persons who had hidden in the store until after closing time. The mechanism sprayed a chemical mist in Customer's face, causing him to become temporarily blind. The mechanism also activated an alarm carried by Store's employee, Watchman, who was just coming to work. Watchman unlocked the front door, ran into the store, and grabbed Customer. Customer, who was still unable to see, struck out at this person and hit a metal rack, injuring his hand. Watchman then identified himself, and Customer did the same. After assuring himself that Customer was telling the truth, Watchman allowed him to leave. If Customer is to prevail on a claim against Store based on battery from the use of the chemical spray, Customer must establish that: A. He suffered severe bodily harm. B.

Fearful that the boat might sink, Peter rowed to a boat dock on shore and tied the boat to the dock. The shore property and dock were the private property of Owner. While the boat was tied at the dock, Owner came down and ordered Peter to remove the boat because the action of the waves was causing the boat to rub against a bumper on the dock. When Peter refused, Owner untied the boat and cast it adrift. The boat sank. Peter was wearing a pair of swimming trunks and nothing else. He had a pair of shoes and a parka in the boat, but they were lost when Owner set it adrift. Peter was staying at a cabin one mile from Owner's property. The only land routes back were a short rocky trail that was dangerous during the storm, and a 15mile road around the lake. The storm continued with heavy rain and hail, and Peter, having informed Owner of the location of his cabin, asked Owner to take him back there in Owner's car. Owner said, You got here by yourself and you'll have to get back home yourself. After one hour the storm stopped, and Peter walked home over the trail. 13.

The infection is quite common after surgeries when soft tissues become infected and the infection moves to the adjacent bones. The long bones of children are particularly susceptible as they have excellent circulation to them during the growth period. In adults, the best circulation is to the vertebrae, and these are the bones that are most likely to develop osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is treated with various antibiotics, but some patients have chronic infections that are not eradicated by antibiotic therapy due to a unique feature of S. aureus. S. aureus can be internalized by osteoblasts where the bacteria can continue to survive in the intracellular environment. Inside the osteoblasts, bacteria can induce apoptosis, killing their host cell. Surgical debridement is often required to remove the damaged and dead bone tissue created by the infection. A major research question deals with how an S. aureus infection induces apoptosis in the host osteoblasts. In order for apoptosis to initiate in osteoblasts, the enzyme capsase8 must be activated. This enzyme serves as a protease that cleaves critical proteins in the cell, causing cell death. Capsase8 is only expressed under certain circumstances. In the case of osteomyelitis, the S. aureus bacteria cause the induction of tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) in the osteoblasts. Then TRAIL activates capsase8, which triggers a series of events leading to apoptosis and death of osteoblasts. Which of the following potential drugs might be helpful in preventing the death of osteoblasts caused by S. aureus infection? A. one that increases capsase8 activity B. one that increases TRAIL activity C. one that is an antagonist to TRAIL D. all of the above Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is C. Death of osteoblasts due to S. aureus infection is the result of induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis is triggered by capsase-8, so increasing the activity of capsase-8 would increase the rate of apoptosis and osteoblast death. Further, capsase-8 is activated by TRAIL made by S. aureus, so increasing the TRAIL activity would also increase osteoblast death rates. A drug that is antagonistic to TRAIL would decrease capsase-8 activity and decrease the rate of apoptosis in osteoblasts."},{"prompt":"mmunodeficiency virus (HIV) is known to infect T cells and macrophages possessing the CD4 receptor. In addition to the CD4 receptor, there are a variety of coreceptors that are also needed for certain strains of HIV to infect cells. One of these coreceptors is called CCR5 and is needed for the most common strains of HIV (called R5) to infect their host cells. The more CCR5 receptors a cell has, the greater the rate of infection for the cell. Some individuals have the delta32 allele of CCR5 that leads to a decreased risk of HIV infection. Women are at a much higher risk for contracting HIV from a male partner than a male is for contracting HIV from a female partner. Some of the increased risk for women is dependent on sex hormones. It has been hypothesized that women have different risks of contracting HIV at different points in their reproductive cycles. For example, women may be at a greater risk of contracting HIV following ovulation during the last 2 weeks of their cycle as opposed to the first 2 weeks of their cycle prior to ovulation. The difference between risk of infection before and after ovulation relates to sex hormones produced at various points in the reproductive cycle. It seems that the estrogen that is produced prior to ovulation provides a somewhat protective, although certainly not absolute, role against HIV infection. For women who do become infected with HIV, studies have shown that women in the first 3 to 5 years after HIV infection carry lower HIV viral loads than men, perhaps due to the influence of estrogen. This suggests a major role for sex hormones in the infection and progression of HIV. Some populations with the delta32 CCR5 mutation seem to have close to 100 % protection against HIV, while other populations with the delta32 CCR5 mutation seem to have only partial protection. What could account for this difference? A. There is an environmental influence on expression of the delta32 CCR5 phenotype. B. The delta32 CCR5 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. Homozygotes have complete protection while heterozygotes have only partial protection. C. The expression of the delta32 CCR5 allele can be masked by epistasis. D. Those that have only partial protection against HIV infection have been exposed to larger doses of HIV. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is B. To answer this question, you need to rely on your knowledge of genetics. The passage states that the delta-32 CCR5 mutation is protective against HIV infection. The question indicated that there are two different phenotypes noted within the delta-32 CCR5 mutation-one that offers near 100 percent protection against HIV infection and one that offers only partial protection. The best explanation for why two phenotypes (complete protection and partial protection) are observed would be that the delta-32 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. An individual that is homozygous for the allele (meaning he or she inherited two copies of the delta-32 allele) would have full protection, while an individual who is heterozygous (meaning he or she has one normal copy of the allele and one copy of the delta-32 allele) would have an intermediate phenotype (being partial protection). This is indicated by choice B. Since the question indicates that the differences in phenotype (protection) are related to the delta32 mutation, choices A and D can be eliminated as they suppose that something other than the allele is providing protection. Choice C suggests that epistasis is involved in masking the delta-32 allele.

In addition to serving as an electron acceptor, the oxygen also gathers protons from the electron transport chain, producing water in the process."},{"prompt":"Endothelin is a vasoactive peptide involved in a variety of processes, including the control of blood flow. Endothelin is capable of binding to two different receptors. There are receptors for endothelin located on smooth muscle (ETA) and receptors for endothelin located on vascular endothelium (ETB). When endothelin binds to ETA, it initiates vasoconstriction by narrowing blood vessels. However, when endothelin binds to ETB, vasodilation occurs due to the widening of blood vessels. The activity of the ETB receptor seems to counterregulate the ETA effects and prevents excessive vasoconstriction. Drug X is a selective receptor antagonist for endothelin. It is designed to bind preferentially to certain endothelin receptors. Drug mathrm{Y} is another selective receptor antagonist for endothelin. It is also designed to preferentially bind to one of the endothelin receptors. Researchers are hopeful that drugs mathrm{X} and mathrm{Y} will be of value in the treatment of conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In PAH, excess endothelin is produced, which causes an increase in blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries. Normal pressure in the pulmonary arteries is expected to be about 14 mathrm{~mm} mathrm{Hg}, and pressure at or above 25 mathrm{~mm} Hg constitutes PAH. Both drugs have been tested in patients with PAH. There were five patients in each group.

The results from the drug mathrm{X} group indicate that the treatment caused an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure. This helps us to eliminate choice mathrm{A}, which suggests that drug mathrm{X} is binding to ETA. If this were the case, the drug would be bound to ETA so that endothelin could only bind to ETB. When endothelin binds to ETB, vasodilation occurs, implying a decrease in pressure. This was not seen in the drug mathrm{X} group. Choice mathrm{B} suggests that drug mathrm{X} is selectively binding to the ETB receptor. This would mean that endothelin could only bind to ETA, which does in fact cause an increase in pressure. This would be the correct choice. Answers and Explanations Passage V MCAT"},{"prompt":"Sperm count in human males is influenced by a variety of factors. One of the most important variables affecting sperm count is the number of Sertoli cells located in seminiferous tubules of the testes. The Sertoli cells' primary function is to nurture cells through the process of spermatogenesis by providing them with nutrients and an environment conducive to spermatogenesis. Each Sertoli cell has a set number of spermatozoa that it can support. Sertoli cells have an additional role in forming the bloodtestis barrier that provides immune privilege for the seminiferous tubules. This forms a physical barricade that keeps the developing sperm from coming into contact with cells of the immune system. While it is not clear as to all the factors involved in determining Sertoli cell number, it is apparent that their development is most critical during the first nine months of life and prior to puberty. Events that affect the development of Sertoli cells in young males can influence fertility later in life. There may also be genetic factors involved in determining the number of Sertoli cells formed in a particular male. The following data were collected from two groups of men. The men in group 1 had a normal sperm count while the men in group 2 were seeking infertility treatment due to a low sperm count. Levels of folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary were measured as were the testicular hormones inhibinB and testosterone in an attempt to determine which hormones seem to be linked to reduced sperm count. begin{tabular}{ccccc} hline Sample Group & LH & FSH & InhibinB & Testosterone hline 1 & 5.3 mathrm{IU} / mathrm{L} & 5.0 mathrm{IU} / mathrm{L} & 190 mathrm{pg} / mathrm{mL} & 18.0 mathrm{nmol} / mathrm{L} 2 & 3.1 mathrm{IU} / mathrm{L} & 17.6 mathrm{IU} / mathrm{L} & 51 mathrm{pg} / mathrm{mL} & 17.8 mathrm{nmol} / mathrm{L} hline end{tabular} Why would it be important for the Sertoli cells to establish a bloodtestis barrier and immune privilege? A. to prevent the immune cells from attacking the sperm cells, which display different antigens from the other cells in the body B. to prevent the developing sperm cells from leaving the reproductive system C. to prevent blood from flowing into the testes D. to keep the developing sperm cells from entering into the epididymis before they are mature Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is mathrm{A}. The blood-testis barrier is described in the passage as a barricade to establish immune privilege for the testes. To answer this question, you need to think about how the sperm cells in the testes would compare to other cells in the body. Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off. This would prevent oxygen and nutrient flow to the area. Preventing the sperm from moving to the epididymis before they are ready does not provide an explanation for why the sperm cells need to be kept separate from the cells of the immune system."},{"prompt":"The one principal effect not attributed to the hormone insulin is: A. glycogen formation and storage B. conversion of glycogen into glucose C. carbohydrate oxidation D. inhibition of gluconeogenesis Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is mathrm{B}. The pancreas is the source for two hormones: insulin and glucagon. Among its principal effects, insulin stimulates glycogen formation and storage, stimulates carbohydrate oxidation, and inhibits gluconeogenesis. All of these effects are described in choices A, C, and D. The other hormone, glucagon, stimulates conversion of glycogen into glucose. So choice B is the correct answer."},{"prompt":"The discovery and development of various types of anesthesia have revolutionized modern medicine, allowing many medical procedures to be performed with minimal discomfort to the patient. Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of mathrm{Na}^{+}gated channels in the neurons. Procaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking mathrm{Na}^{+}gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug. Procaine has a halflife of up to 0.5 hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The halflife of lidocaine in patients is typically between 1.5 and 2 hours. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by two enzymes that produce the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The passage states that when lidocaine is given for ventricular fibrillation the sinoatrial node is unaffected. The sinoatrial node normally functions as: A. a valve in the heart B. the pacemaker of the heart C. the barricade between the right and left side of the heart that keeps oxygenated and deoxygenated blood from mixing D. a regulator of blood pressure in the heart Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is mathrm{B}. This question relies on your knowledge of the anatomy of the heart and the conducting system of the heart. The sinoatrial node (SA node) is a group of conducting cells located in the right atrium. Recall that the valves of the heart are atrioventricular (AV) and semilunar valves. The barricade that divides the right and left side of the heart is the septum. The SA node generates electrical signals that control cardiac muscle contractions and serves as the pacemaker for the heart."},{"prompt":"Leukemia is a term that describes a wide variety of blood cell cancers. Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate. Once classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected. Chemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cellcycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulinbinding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to this area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain. What is the most logical explanation for why certain drugs may NOT be able to reach the brain if they have been ingested or injected? A. These drugs have a chemical nature that does not allow them to cross the bloodbrain barrier. B. These drugs are so toxic that they are broken down before they reach the brain. C. Most of these drugs target only cancerous cells that normally would not be in the brain. D. The drugs that have been ingested have likely been denatured by the acids in the stomach. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is mathrm{A}. The blood-brain barrier is a change in the permeability of blood vessels leading to the brain. Depending on the chemical composition, some drugs can cross and some cannot. Of the choices listed, it seems that if the drugs cannot reach the brain, then they have not crossed the blood-brain barrier. While choice D might seem plausible if a drug was ingested, it would not make sense for a drug that was injected."},{"prompt":"Neurons contain a high concentration of potassium ions relative to the fluids surrounding them. How could a neuron acquire even more potassium? A. active transport B. osmosis C. endocytosis D. diffusion Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is A. This question is asking how to move a potassium ion (which is small) from an area that has a low concentration to an area with a relatively higher concentration. In this case we are moving against the concentration gradient. The transport type that could do this is active transport, using energy to move the ions against their concentration gradient."},{"prompt":"Passage mathrm{V} For many years, researchers have been interested in developing edible vaccines that would provide protection against various bacterial and viral diseases. An edible vaccine is a genetically modified organism (GMO) that is created when genes from the bacteria or virus being vaccinated against are inserted into plant cells. As the plants grow, they produce proteins from the bacteria or virus that the researchers are attempting to vaccinate against. When a person eats the plant, the viral or bacteria proteins serve as antigens, which initiates a primary immune response. Some of the plants that are of interest in edible vaccine development are bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, rice, tobacco, and soybeans. While early research focused on growing crops that produced edible products such as bananas, the most recent research is focused on extracting material from the leaves and seeds of the plants, dehydrating it, and putting it into capsules that can be swallowed. This allows for a more predictable dosage of the vaccine and eliminates concerns that the crops containing the vaccine would be accidentally eaten by individuals who are not in need of the vaccine. The term edible vaccine has now been replaced with the term plantderived oral vaccine. The development of plantderived oral vaccines solves many problems associated with injectable vaccines. Because plantderived oral vaccines are grown in crops, there is no problem with storage or refrigeration that is required of most traditional vaccines. These plantderived vaccines also require no special training to administer. Additionally, when a vaccine is taken orally, it provides mucosal immunity due to the production of IgA antibodies by the immune systemin addition to systemic immunity. Since 90 percent of diseases enter the body through a mucus membrane, a vaccine that coerces mucosal immunity is of great benefit in the prevention of many diseases. Plantderived oral vaccines produce bacterial or viral proteins that serve as antigens in the body. Which of these events would occur first when a new antigen enters the body? A. production of antibodies from plasma cells B. presentation of the antigen by a macrophage C. secretion of interleukin2 from helper T cells D. attack of the antigen by cytotoxic T cells Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is mathrm{B}. This question requires an understanding of the specific defenses of the immune system. The ultimate goal of the specific defenses is to allow for the production of antibodies from plasma cells and the production of cytotoxic mathrm{T} cells. However, neither of these things can occur without the activation of a helper mathrm{T} cell. In order to activate the helper mathrm{T} cell, macrophages must phagocytize foreign antigens. The fragments of these antigens will be displayed on the surface of the macrophage. This antigen presenting cell will then activate the helper mathrm{T} cell."},{"prompt":"Genetically modified (GM) foods contain DNA from more than one source. The goal of creating GM foods is to modify the organisms to express new and useful traits. A few examples involve engineering crops to be resistant to bacterial or viral infections, to be resistant to herbicides, to ripen more slowly, to survive extreme temperature changes, to contain vaccines, or to create crops that are more nutritious. One GM food that has received media attention over the years is golden rice. This GM product was first introduced in 2000 and was engineered to provide carotene that is a precursor to vitamin mathrm{A}. The carotene in the rice provides the golden color. Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in underdeveloped parts of the world, killing more than one million people a year, most of whom are children. This vitamin is critical for the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, for vision, and for growth. Rice plants normally produce carotene in the inedible parts of the plant. To be able to access and use the carotene, it was necessary to engineer the rice to produce it in the edible grains. In order to achieve this goal, two genes from daffodil plants, psy and l y c, and a bacterial gene called c r t 1 were added to the rice genome. These genes engineered a pathway that produces lycopene, which is eventually converted to carotene. Each of these genes was placed under the control of a grainspecific promoter so that the products were produced in the rice grains. While golden rice was produced to provide carotene, which the human body can convert into the essential vitamin A, the rice provided much less carotene than was anticipated. Golden rice 2, a modified version released in 2005, contains a much larger amount of carotene and, as such, is a better source of the vitamin. Field tests were conducted in 2009, and human consumption trials were completed in 2012. However, neither version has been grown in largescale quantities at this time. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be produced in a variety of ways. In the case of golden rice, genes from the daffodil plant and bacteria were added to the rice genome. Which of the following would be necessary to remove the genes from these other organisms so that they could be added to rice? A. reverse transcriptase B. a viral vector C. restriction enzymes D. polymerase chain reaction Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","completion":"The correct answer is C. Restriction enzymes are known to cut DNA at specific recognition sequences and are valuable tools for excising genes to be transferred from one source to another. Reverse transcriptase is used to copy RNA to DNA. Viral vectors can carry DNA of interest into other cells, but they are not used to remove genes from an organism. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to produce multiple copies of a target DNA sequence."},{"prompt":"An endocrinologist has been studying an enzyme that she suspects is the ratelimiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to estrogen.

It involves a system of communication between organisms that is dependent on population density. Bacteria are notorious for using quorum sensing (QS) via the secretion of secreted signaling molecules, called autoinducers (AI), to coordinate their gene expression once a threshold density of population is reached. Not only can bacteria communicate via QS within their species, but they can also crosstalk through QS between different species. In order to participate in quorum sensing, bacteria require a way to produce an autoinducer and a way to respond to autoinducers via binding to specific receptors. One example of how bacteria use quorum sensing to their advantage is to regulate the gene expression of virulence factors. During infection, if a small number of bacteria were to express their virulence factors, this would largely have no impact on the host. Instead, bacteria wait until a quorum is reached in terms of population size, indicating that the population is large enough to express virulence factors. These virulence factors relate to such abilities as escaping the immune response, invasion, and spreading within the host. We know that we are facing a current healthcare crisis related to the loss of effectiveness of many traditional types of antibiotics based on bacterial resistance. This provides a major impetus for identifying novel ways to target bacterial pathogens that avoid the use of antibiotics. Several chemical compounds and molecules have been identified as facilitators of quorum sensing inhibition. Typically, these factors can serve as signaltargeting enzymes or smallmolecule inhibitors of signal synthases and receptors. Quorum sensing is used frequently within populations of bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa that form biofilms within their host. Once a quorum is reached, expression of the genes required for biofilm formation occurs. From the bacterial perspective, what direct advantage does the formation of biofilms provide? A.

Because of the conservation of parity in strong interaction, a quantum state that is initially an S state cannot have a P state component at any later moment. The possible spin values for a system composed of a proton and a neutron are 1 and 0 . We are given mathbf{J}=mathbf{L}+mathbf{S} and J=1. If S=0, L=1, the system would be in a P state, which must be excluded as we have seen in (a). The allowed values are then S=1, L=2,1,0. Therefore a G state (L=4) cannot contribute. The total spin is mathbf{S}=mathbf{s}_{p}+mathbf{s}_{n}. For a pure D state with J=1, the orbital angular momentum (relative to the center of mass of the n and p ) is L=2 and the total spin must be S=1.

A: dark yellow flowers B: ff All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.","completion":"An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

A: BB B: a banded shell All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait. For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent. An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene. An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.","completion":"An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.
